Less attention has been paid to what voters were rebelling against.\n\nThere were economic grievances \u2014 in the Upper Midwest in particular \u2014 but the economy as a whole is slowly recovering. (As Alexis de Tocqueville observed, revolutions tend to occur in times of rising expectations.)\n\nBut at its core, the revolution of 2016 was an attempt at restoration \u2014 at fixing a broken system.\n\nWhat broke it? Both parties acquiesced in bank\u00a0liberalization, open-borders immigration, and Wall Street bailouts.\n\nBut the most acute challenge was Barack Obama\u2019s\u00a0direct attack on the constitutional framework itself.\u00a0Obama sought to transform America, and believed that the\u00a0ends would justify the means.\n\nRepublicans, hypnotized by race\u00a0and cowed by the media, put up little fight. So voters took matters into their own hands.\n\nHere are ten of the most serious ways Obama broke the system.\n\n1. The stimulus. On the campaign trail, Obama promised a $50 billion stimulus and criticized George W. Bush\u00a0for building up the national debt. In office, Obama passed a nearly $1 trillion stimulus, over Republican objections, that failed to keep unemployment from below 8% (as promised), and went largely to pet projects and state and local governments. The profligate spending shocked voters\u00a0who feared that the country was now on an irreversible path to fiscal ruin. The Tea Party\u00a0was born.\n\n2. Fast and Furious. The Obama administration smuggled guns across the Mexican border, ostensibly to trace them to drug cartels. Unlike the Bush administration\u2019s Wide Receiver, Obama\u2019s Operation Fast and Furious happened without the Mexican government\u2019s knowledge. The likely goal was to create a pretext for reducing\u00a0gun ownership in the U.S. It led to the murders of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry and hundreds of Mexicans. Afterwards,\u00a0Obama\u00a0used \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d to cover it up.\n\n3. Betraying allies. Obama\u00a0picked public fights with Israel in a deliberate effort to establish \u201cdistance\u201d between the allies. He also broke agreements with the Czechs and the Poles on missile defense, infamously informing the Polish prime minister on the 70th anniversary of the Katyn Massacre. He snubbed the British\u00a0in ways small (returning a Churchill bust) and big\u00a0(using the Argentinian term \u201cMalvinas\u201d for the Falklands). And he spied on foreign allies, including Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel.\n\n4. Obamacare. The sweeping plan for \u201cuniversal\u201d health insurance sought, fundamentally, to make individuals dependent on the state, the better to open the door to even more sweeping changes. But it was the process of passing the bill that caused the real damage. To pass Obamacare, Obama bent and broke procedural rules; lied, repeatedly, about the policy; disguised a tax as a fee; and bullied the Supreme Court into compliance. It was the first major entitlement passed without bipartisan support.\n\n5. Debt ceiling. Few of the Republicans who rode the Tea Party wave in 2010 made an issue out of the debt ceiling. But the Obama administration believed that a confrontation would help it regain full control of Congress. So it picked a fight over the debt, and forced a confrontation in the summer of 2011 that brought the country to the brink of default. Obama scuttled a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with Republicans by demanding higher taxes.\u00a0The result: a hated budget \u201csequester\u201d and a credit downgrade.\n\n6. Benghazi. Presidents had lied to the country before about national security incidents: the Iran-Contra scandal, for example, left a stain on\u00a0Ronald Reagan\u2019s legacy. But no previous American president had abandoned Americans to die abroad without putting up a fight or making a serious effort to punish the perpetrators. In fact, in the heat of battle, Obama went to sleep and flew to a political fundraiser in Las Vegas the next day. It was an unprecedented abdication of his commander-in-chief role.\n\n7. IRS scandal.\u00a0Encouraged by Obama\u2019s attacks on \u201cdark money\u201d and conservative political donors, the\u00a0Internal Revenue Service began singling out conservative non-profit organizations for excessive scrutiny, denying them the ability to operate during the crucial 2012 elections, and trying to pry loose\u00a0private information on their donors, their meetings, and even the content of their prayers. To this day, no Obama administration official has been punished for that horrific abuse of power.\n\n8. AP scandal. Despite the media\u2019s ongoing love affair with Obama, the administration targeted journalists for harassment, surveillance and prosecution. In one case, the Department of Justice seized phone records from the Associated Press; in another, the DOJ searched the emails of Fox News reporter James Rosen and his family. Congress later found Attorney General Eric Holder misled it\u00a0when he told them in May 2013 he had not been involved in potential prosecution of the media.\n\n9. Iran deal. After resisting sanctions on Iran, and holding off on any real action against the Iranian regime when it faced mass protests in 2009, Obama\u00a0made\u00a0a deal with Iran in 2015 that removed most sanctions in exchange for a mere temporary slowdown in the Iranian nuclear program. Worse, he refused to submit it to the Senate for ratification in accordance with the Constitution\u2019s Treaty Clause, and Democrats\u00a0blocked a weaker effort to submit the deal to an overall congressional vote.\n\n10. Executive action on immigration.\u00a0Obama abused prosecutorial discretion in 2012 in\u00a0announcing \u201cDeferred Action for Children of Americans\u201d (DACA) in 2012, even after Congress declined to pass legislation\u00a0on \u201cDreamers.\u201d But the real offense came after the 2014 elections, when Obama defied the electorate and announced an \u201cexecutive amnesty\u201d \u2014 \u201cDeferred Action for Parents of Americans\u201d (DAPA) \u2014 that he himself said dozens of times was unconstitutional (he lost in the courts).\n\nJoel B.

Terrorist Anis Amir was the quintessential \"known wolf,\" long known to authorities as a possible threat and supposedly under surveillance, but still able to murder a truck driver, run down a dozen people with his stolen vehicle, and romp across at least three European countries during his getaway attempt. He died screaming \"Allahu akbar!\" in a shootout with Italian police on Friday.\n\nThe Berlin attack could have profound implications for the future of Germany, and Europe. \"He had no ID documents after the event, there was a full manhunt in place and nonetheless he was able to cross two or three borders before he was eventually apprehended and even then really on the basis of more of a suspicious routine stop rather than an intelligence-led operation,\" as former head of the U.K. Border Force noted to Sky News.\n\nAmir's videotaped vow of loyalty to the Islamic State and its \"caliph,\" Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was released by the terror state within hours of his death.\n\nAnkara assassination: On the same day Germany was dealing with the Berlin attack, a sharply-dressed plainclothes Turkish police officer abruptly drew his gun and murdered Russian Ambassador Andrey Karlov before a throng of horrified reporters, while Karlov was giving a speech at an art gallery.\n\nThe killer, 22-year-old Mevlut Mert Altintas, was killed by Turkish security forces in an ensuing gun battle. \n\nDuring the attack, he said he was acting on behalf of Syrians and those killed during the siege of the city of Aleppo. Although the Islamic State celebrated the murder of the Russian ambassador, the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front of Syria claimed responsibility, named Altintas as one of its \"heroes,\" and said Karlov's murder was the \"first act of revenge\" for those killed in Syria, and Muslims killed around the world. The authenticity of al-Nusra's claim has not yet been verified.\n\nLibyan plane hijacked by Qaddafi dead-enders: Fortunately, the hijacking of a Libyan airplane forced to land on Malta, by a pair of twentysomething terrorists who claimed to be armed with grenades, ended with all 111 passengers safe on Friday. 28 of the passengers were women, and one of them was an infant, as reported by the New York Times.\n\nThe hijackers sought \"asylum in a European country where they can establish a political party named al-Fateh that represents the old regime.\" \n\nOddly, no European countries are rushing forward to give them homes and help them set up their pro-Qaddafi party. Perhaps there was a better way to go about it than hijacking an airplane two days before Christmas. \n\nThe grenade and two pistols carried by the hijackers were reportedly fake. In a strange twist, the real hijacking interrupted a fake hijacking that just happened to be filming at the airport in Malta for a movie.\n\nMassive Christmas Day attack thwarted in Australia: Four men aged 21 to 26 were arrested Friday morning for planning to set off a string of bombs at locations in central Melbourne. Among the targets scouted by the group were the Federation Square shopping district, St. Paul's Cathedral, and Melbourne's busiest train station. Murders by knife and gun were planned to supplement the casualties from the explosions.\n\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull described them as \"self-radicalized\" acolytes of the Islamic State. Three of the suspects have been named as Abdullah Chaarani, 26, Hamza Abbas, 21, and Ahmed Mohamed, 24. The fourth, said to be 22 years old, had not been named at the time of this writing. Australia's police commissioner said one of the suspects was an Egyptian-born Australian citizen, while the others were of Lebanese background but born in Australia.\n\nTerrorists killed while planning Christmas Day attack on Indonesian police: Three men believed to have been planning to murder police officers on Christmas Day were killed after they threw a bomb at police during a raid on their house Thursday.\n\n\"The information we received was there were three bombs ready to explode inside the house \u2013 pipe [bombs inside] three backpacks,\" a police spokesman told the Sydney Morning Herald. The Christmas Day plan involved stabbing someone to bring a police response, and then detonating a bomb to kill the responding officers.\n\nThis cell is thought to be connected to the terrorists who were planning to bomb the presidential palace in Jakarta with a pressure cooker bomb earlier this month \u2013 an attack that would have involved a female suicide bomber, a new threat for Indonesia.\n\nISIS plot to bomb Christmas shoppers in Britain\u00a0thwarted:\u00a0British counter-terrorism officials announced they halted a \u201csignificant plot\u201d inspired by ISIS to bomb crowded shopping centers during the last few days before Christmas, with four people in custody. The arrests were made ten days ago.\n\nTeen jihadis arrested in Belgium for plotting to bomb Christmas carnival:\u00a0Ten teenagers were arrested last weekend for planning to attack Christmas carnivals, using bombs they learned how to make online.

Ryan Zinke as Interior secretary Thursday, picking a man who should fit smoothly into an administration favoring more energy drilling and less regulation.\n\nIn the evening, he was to embark on his latest campaign victory lap, this time to Pennsylvania, which he wrested from decades in the Democratic column. He also found time to hit Twitter, playing media critic and then stating anew his doubts about charges that Russia hackers tried to disrupt the U.S. election.\n\nTrump praised Zinke, a former Navy SEAL, as having \u201cbuilt one of the strongest track records on championing regulatory relief, forest management, responsible energy development and public land issues.\u201d Zinke, 55, was an early supporter of the president-elect and publicly expressed his interest in a Cabinet post when Trump visited Montana in May.\n\nAs with several other Cabinet selections, Zinke has advocated increased drilling and mining on public lands and has expressed skepticism about the urgency of climate change. He attracted attention in the 2014 campaign for calling Hillary Clinton \u201cthe Antichrist.\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan praised the pick, saying Zinke \u201chas been an ardent supporter of all-of-the-above energy policies and responsible land management.\u201d\n\nBut his nomination could have a ripple effect on control of the Senate, since Zinke now may forgo what was once a near-certain challenge to Democratic Sen. Jon Tester in 2018.\n\nOne of Zinke\u2019s backers was Land Tawney, head of sportsmen\u2019s group Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, and a friend of Donald Trump Jr. Tawney also has ties to Tester and volunteered for a pro-Tester super PAC a few years ago. But in an interview, Tawney denied a Politico report that his support for Zinke had anything to do with sidelining him from the Senate race.\n\n\u201cI think there are some folks who don\u2019t like the pick of Zinke for that position, and that they\u2019re trying to politicize this to change that, and I think that\u2019s absolutely ridiculous,\u201d said Tawney. He said a focus on preserving public lands led him to oppose other potential nominees, including Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rogers.\n\nTrump also added to his national security team by announcing the appointments of retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg as chief of staff of the National Security Council and Monica Crowley, a Fox News analyst, as the organization\u2019s director of communications.\n\nKellogg spent more than 35 years in the Army and, in 2003, oversaw the efforts to form the new Iraqi military after it was disbanded. Crowley and Fox ended their relationship on Thursday.\n\nTrump has two Cabinet selections yet to make though he also needs to fill out much of his White House staff. After a day of meetings at Trump Tower, which includes immigration hardliner Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach and some members of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Trump was to travel to Hershey, Pennsylvania for a rally.\n\nPennsylvania had not gone for a Republican candidate since 1988. But the Trump campaign staff long thought that the state, rich in white working-class voters, would be receptive to his populist message and not be part of Clinton\u2019s hoped-for firewall.\n\nTrump repeatedly campaigned there and won the state by less than 1 percentage point, giving him a vital 20 electoral college votes.\n\nThe president-elect was busy on Twitter Thursday morning.\n\nHe again cast doubt on U.S. intelligence assertions about Russia election hacking, writing \u201cIf Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?\u201d\n\nThat assertion is untrue. A month before the election, the Obama administration bluntly accused Russia of hacking American political sites and email accounts to interfere.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he\u2019d like to improve ties with Russia, a hope that has been echoed in Moscow. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on Thursday lauded Trump\u2019s Cabinet selections as people with no \u201canti-Russian stereotypes.\u201d\n\nMedvedev said in a televised interview that Moscow is glad Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson has been chosen as secretary of state, describing him as someone with \u201cpragmatic thinking.\u201d\n\nThe Kremlin has cheered Trump\u2019s victory although some Russian officials have recently said they are not expecting relations between Russia and the U.S., which were battered after Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014, to improve overnight.\n\nTrump also tweeted, \u201cThe media tries so hard to make my move to the White House, as it pertains to my business, so complex \u2013 when actually it isn\u2019t!\u201d His declaration came on the day he was supposed to hold a news conference, now postponed \u2019til January, to reveal how he plans to distance himself from his business. Aides said more time was needed to finalize the complicated arrangement.\n\n____\n\nAP Congressional Correspondent Erica Werner in Washington contributed to this report..\n\n___\n\nReach Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.7050528526306149, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 786, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.4770978917500002, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 11, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161215230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.39949109414758, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.0}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/11/02/validly-predicated-investigation-reports-prove-fbi-aggressively-investigating-clinton-foundation-potential-pay-play-crimes/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "'Validly Predicated Investigation': Reports Prove FBI 'Aggressively Investigating' Clinton Foundation For Potential Pay To Play Crimes", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1154, "date": "20161103030000", "story_content": "NEW YORK CITY, New York \u2014 A pair of reports out on Wednesday evening from two of the nation's biggest broadcasters brings gloomy news for the already hurting presidential campaign of Democratic nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton: The FBI has been \"aggressively investigating\" the Clinton Foundation for a year.\n\nAll of this comes as a third report, from the Wall Street Journal, walks through how \"secret recordings\" have \"fueled\" the FBI's criminal investigation into the Clinton Foundation\u2014a separate but parallel probe from the Hillary Clinton email scandal.\n\nPamela Brown, CNN's Justice Department correspondent, announced on air on Wednesday:\n\nMy colleague Evan Perez and I have spoken to more than a dozen officials and agents and have learned that agents in the FBI wanted to aggressively investigate the Clinton Foundation several months ago. Earlier in the year, the Justice Department told the FBI essentially you don't have enough evidence here for predication to get more tools such as warrants and subpoenas. 'Go back and see what else you can dig up.' We are told that after the Clinton email probe initially wrapped up in July that those agents wanted to continue their work on the case and again DOJ said 'you don't have enough evidence here to really investigate' and so things are sort of on hold and this has sort of caused tensions to flare in the FBI and the Department of Justice. Some of those agents feel like those roadblocks are politically-driven.\n\nWATCH PAMELA BROWN\u2019S CNN REPORT ON CLINTON FOUNDATION CORRUPTION PROBE:\n\n\n\nSimilarly, over on Fox News, Special Report anchor Bret Baier dropped another bombshell on Wednesday night:\n\nTwo separate sources with intimate knowledge of the FBI investigations into the Clinton emails and the Clinton Foundation tell Fox the following: The investigation into the Clinton Foundation, looking into possible pay-for-play interaction between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Foundation has been going on for more than a year led by the White Collar Crime Division, Public Corruption Branch of the Criminal Investigative Division of the FBI. The Clinton Foundation investigation is a 'very high priority.' Agents have interviewed and re-interviewed multiple people about the Foundation case and even before the WikiLeaks dumps these sources said agents had collected a great deal of evidence. Pressed on that, one source said 'a lot of it, and there is an avalanche of new information coming in every day\u2014some of it from WikiLeaks, some from new emails.' The agents are actively and aggressively pursuing this case and they will be going back and interviewing the same people again, some for the third time. As a result of the limited immunity deals to top aides including Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, the Justice Department had tentatively agreed that the Justice Department would destroy those laptops after a narrow review. We are told definitively that has not happened and those devices are currently in the FBI field office here in Washington, D.C., and are being exploited. The source points out any immunity deal is null and void if any subject has lied at any point in the investigation.\n\nBaier also had new information on the investigation\u2014a separate but parallel criminal probe\u2014into Hillary Clinton's emails. Baier reported:\n\nMeanwhile, the classified email investigation is being run by the National Security Division of the FBI. They are currently combing through former Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner's laptop. They have found emails they believe came from Hillary Clinton's server and that also appear to be new\u2014as in, not duplicates. Whether they contain classified material or not is not yet known, but will likely be known soon.\n\nWATCH BRET BAIER ANNOUNCE THE BOMBSHELLS ON FOX NEWS\n\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal on Wednesday night also broke a big story on this front.\n\n\"Secret Recordings Fueled FBI Feud in Clinton Probe,\" read the headline from the Wall Street Journal's Devlin Barrett and Christopher Matthews, with a sub-headline reading: \"Agents thought they had enough material to merit aggressively pursuing investigation into Clinton Foundation.\"\n\n\"Secret recordings of a suspect talking about the Clinton Foundation fueled an internal battle between FBI agents who wanted to pursue the case and corruption prosecutors who viewed the statements as worthless hearsay, people familiar with the matter said,\" Barrett and Matthews wrote.\n\nIn the wake of Breitbart News Editor at Large and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer's bombshell spring 2015 book Clinton Cash, the Wall Street Journal reported that FBI agents \"using informants and recordings from unrelated corruption investigations, thought they had found enough material to merit aggressively pursuing the investigation into the foundation.\"\n\nAgents wanted to pursue a more aggressive investigation, they reported, but officials at the politically tainted Department of Justice wouldn't let them. The Wall Street Journal reporters wrote:\n\nStarting in February and continuing today, investigators from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and public-corruption prosecutors became increasingly frustrated with each other, as often happens within and between departments. At the center of the tension stood the U.S. attorney for Brooklyn, Robert Capers, who some at the FBI came to view as exacerbating the problems by telling each side what it wanted to hear, these people said. Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Capers declined to comment. The roots of the dispute lie in a disagreement over the strength of the case, these people said, which broadly centered on whether Clinton Foundation contributors received favorable treatment from the State Department under Hillary Clinton. Senior officials in the Justice Department and the FBI didn't think much of the evidence, while investigators believed they had promising leads their bosses wouldn't let them pursue, they said.\n\nBut more importantly, FBI agents actually presented the case to prosecutors\u2014after which they were told by officials in the politically controlled DOJ to \"stand down.\" Barrett and Matthews wrote:\n\nAs 2015 came to a close, the FBI and Justice Department had a general understanding that neither side would take major action on Clinton Foundation matters without meeting and discussing it first. In February, a meeting was held in Washington among FBI officials, public-integrity prosecutors and Leslie Caldwell, the head of the Justice Department's criminal division. Prosecutors from the Eastern District of New York\u2014Mr. Capers' office\u2014didn't attend, these people said. The public-integrity prosecutors weren't impressed with the FBI presentation, people familiar with the discussion said. 'The message was, 'We're done here,' ' a person familiar with the matter said. Justice Department officials became increasingly frustrated that the agents seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions. Following the February meeting, officials at Justice Department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to 'stand down,' a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nMost damning for the Clintons, however, is the revelation that according to the Wall Street Journal report, even FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe confirmed that the FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation was a \"validly predicated investigation\" to some people at the Justice Department who tried to shut down the case.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.56198358535767, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1102, "FairnessVirtue": 12, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.3153786416, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161103030000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.0871143375680603, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2016/12/14/filmmaker-ami-horowitz-beaten-swedish-no-go-zone-can-tell-fact-exist/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [4142, 7431, 7444]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1250, "scraper_regex": 1329}}, "headline": "Filmmaker Ami Horowitz Beaten in Swedish No-Go Zone: 'I Can Tell You for a Fact They Exist'", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1329, "date": "20161214210000", "story_content": "On Wednesday's Breitbart News Daily, documentary filmmaker Ami Horowitz told the story of his venture into one of the controversial Muslim \"no-go zones\" in Europe.\n\nHorowitz recalled traveling to Stockholm, Sweden, because, \"believe it or not, Sweden has taken in more Islamic refugees per capita than any Western nation, maybe even than any nation on the earth, including Turkey.\"\n\n\"Over the last two years, they've taken in over 350,000 Syrian refugees,\" he said. \"The reason why I went there was to investigate why Sweden has become the rape capital of Europe. Rape was not unknown, but relatively minor. There were few incidents of rape, let's say about ten years ago. And rape has absolutely skyrocketed in Europe. So that was the initial impetus on why I went there. Of course, we found out that there was, in fact, a correlation between the immigration and the rape.\"\n\n\"What happened to me was, when I hear the words 'no-go area,' I go. That's kind of what I do. People like me are not understood by people who are not like you and me,\" he told Kassam. \"People have a hard time understanding why we do what we do. But you get it.\"\n\n\"Once we crossed the threshold into this area called Husby \u2013 and by the way, I want to point out, beautiful leafy suburb, like all of these no-go areas I went to outside of Stockholm. Really, it's beautiful. They're nice, and they're quiet, nice buildings and wide boulevards. So it looked like there's not going to be an issue here; this can't be like a real thing,\" he said.\n\n\"We cross into it, and I would say not even fifteen, maybe five seconds after we crossed in, five guys approached me and my crew,\" he continued. \"They said to us, 'You guys gotta get out of here right now.' My crew, being Swedish, they turned around and they booked out. I, being stupid, decided I'm going to stay and try to figure this thing out with these guys.\"\n\n\"Before the words can come out of my mouth, trying to explain what I'm doing there, the five guys jump on top of me. They were punching me, they were choking me, they were kicking me,\" Horowitz said. \"Normally, when I've been in fights before, thank God, I'm not the greatest fighter in the world, within five seconds somebody usually pulls the two apart. And I figured this is a very crowded square. I figured people would have pulled them off me, obviously. And when I noticed that wasn't happening, I kind of peeked out of \u2013 my arms were covering up my head \u2013 I peeked out, and I noticed people in the square were pointing. They were laughing. Clearly, nobody was coming to my aid. I knew that if I wanted to get out of this in one piece, I had to get out myself.\"\n\nHe recalled getting to his knees and pulling the nearest assailant down by the shirt. \"I hit him as hard as I could in the throat,\" he said. \"They kind of let go for just a moment, enough for me to get up and run. The problem was that my legs were all charley horsed because they kept kicking my legs. My arms, my legs, that's what they were really getting access to.\"\n\n\"They took me down again, and they dragged me into a building, and I thought to myself, 'This is where it's going to end. They're dragging me out of sight to finish me off,\u2019\" Horowitz said. \"Within seconds of them starting the attack again \u2013 thank God, it was an apartment building vestibule \u2013 somebody opened their apartment door, and for some reason, spooked them, and they took off. That's how I survived the attack.\"\n\nHorowitz recalled his assailants \"saying something to themselves in Arabic,\" in addition to yelling, \"What are you doing here? Stop filming! Stop filming!\" as they beat him to the ground.\n\n\"After that, it was mostly me screaming, like a little kid.\" he added.\n\nHe noted that he had visited the area the previous day to scope out filming locations, without issue, so he surmised his return in the company of a group carrying video equipment prompted the attack.\n\n\"Let's define what a 'no-go area' means, really, at least in Sweden,\" he said. \"What's interesting is, there's an actual debate out there whether\u00a0or not these places even exist, right? You go to CNN, the BBC, and you listen to people discuss no-go areas in France, in Belgium, in Sweden, in Germany. And there's an actual debate whether this is real or the figment of the conservative imagination. I can tell you for a fact they exist. And in Sweden what that means is, and this is what the police tell me, they use the words 'no-go area.' They said, in their words, 'If we're chasing a suspect, and they cross into this no-go area, we simply stop pursuit.' And if we want to enter this area, we have to go in with an armed convoy, as if you're going into like the kill zone in Afghanistan.\"\n\n\"Same goes for emergency services,\" Horowitz added. \"In fact, the emergency services in Sweden sued the government to not go into these areas unless they're with military transport \u2013 literally what they sued. These areas used to have police stations, like every other suburb in Stockholm. They came under such constant attack, it became so dangerous, they moved out their police stations. This is, again, their words \u2013 'a state within a state.'\"\n\nKassam said he has personally observed similar problems in \u2018no-go\u2019 and \"you wouldn't want to go\" areas in continental Europe and the U.K., making mainstream media denials of the no-go zones surreal to his ears. He suspected many of the reporters who deny the existence of these areas simply have never visited one.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of truth to that,\" Horowitz replied. \"Now, we've got to be careful because words matter, and I think the problem with the Left is that words matter less than they do to us on the Right. What I mean by that is, we need to be careful what we define as a no-go area. If I think somewhere is dangerous to go to, and maybe not the best place for a guy with a tefillin and a yarmulke to go to \u2013 that's not exactly what I would call a no-go area. That's a dangerous area they should probably stay away from. That even exists in the United States.\"\n\nBy contrast, he said a true no-go area is a place where \"literally, you can't go in if you're not Islamic, and certainly you don't go in if you're the police, unless you have, like I said, an armed convoy, U.S. military style. That's what I define as a no-go area.\"\n\nKassam disagreed, contending that \"any area of any Western country where anyone of non-Arab or non-Northern African descent feels in the slightest bit uncomfortable or threatened, that is a no-go zone because that should not exist anywhere in the West.\" He argued that accepting such outrages in the slightest is the top of a \"slippery slope\" that can lead to more severe forms of ghettoization. Horowitz conceded this was a \"fair point.\"\n\nHorowitz said he's doing fine after the attack, which happened a few months ago. \"I didn't break anything. I was just very bruised up,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, I've gotten my butt kicked a few times, so I have a good sense of how to protect myself, protect the vital areas.\"\n\n\"It felt like an eternity, but it wasn't more than two or three minutes overall, which, believe me, two or three minutes is a very, very long time when every second is somewhat painful,\" he said. \"Thank God, I'm fine, all healed up, back to where I was.\"\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\u00a0to 9:00 a.m.\u00a0Eastern.\n\nLISTEN:\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.4028267860412598, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1250, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 8, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.45286137513, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 19, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161214210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.52, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.72727272727}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/01/13/contagious-tuberculosis-tb-new-hampshire/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [227, 643, 801, 1038, 3277, 5242, 6420, 6564, 6567, 6570]}}, "headline": "Tuberculosis: Refugees Produce 29 Percent of Active Cases in New Hampshire", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1050, "date": "20170113220000", "story_content": "The refugees resettled by the federal government in New Hampshire produced 29 percent of all diagnosed active tuberculosis (TB) cases in the state during\u00a02014 and 2015, says the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nThree contagious TB cases, or \u201cactive tuberculosis,\u201d in New Hampshire were diagnosed in refugees in 2015, and four cases were diagnosed in refugees during 2014. During that two year period, a total of 24 cases of active TB were diagnosed in New Hampshire.\n\nSo seven of the 24 active cases, or 29 percent, were among refugees delivered by the federal government.\u00a0The refugee population is less than one percent of the total state population.\n\nNew Hampshire does, however, have a much higher per capita rate of refugee TB\u00a0compared to other states.\n\nBetween FY 2008 and FY 2015, 4,368 refugees were resettled in New Hampshire by the federal government. More than 80 percent of these refugees, or 3,497 out of 4,368, arrived from four high TB burden countries,\u00a0according to the Department of State\u2013Bhutan (2,239 refugees), the Democratic Republic of Congo (797 refugees), Burma (291 refugees), and Somalia (170 refugees).\n\nOnly Minnesota, where 33 percent of TB cases during this period, or 99 out of 297, were diagnosed in refugees, had a higher percentage than New Hampshire\u2019s 29 percent among all 46 states for which the CDC reports data on immigration status upon first entry data for foreign-born cases of TB. (Arizona, Illinois, Virginia, and Washington do not report this data to the CDC.)\n\nThe national average, 4.5 percent, is significantly lower.\n\n\u201cIn New Hampshire, based on our most recent 2015 data, a total of 13 cases of TB were reported to the NH Department of Health & Human Services, Division of Public Health Services (DPHS); 11 of these cases (85%) were among foreign-born persons,\u201d a spokesperson for the New Hampshire Department of Health & Human Services told Breitbart News in an emailed statement.\n\nNew Hampshire\u2019s percentage of foreign-born cases of TB in 2015 was 19 percent higher than the national average of 66 percent. In 1986, the national average of foreign-born cases of TB was only 22 percent.\n\n\u201cNH DPHS does not distinguish among categories of foreign-born because our public health interventions are not different; however, based on the most recent CDC surveillance report, (table 36), only 3 of these 11 foreign-born individuals diagnosed with TB in 2015 were refugees,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nOnly two of the 13 cases of active TB in New Hampshire in 2015 were diagnosed in U.S.-born residents. Three cases were diagnosed in refugees, and six cases were diagnosed in foreign-born residents of New Hampshire whose immigration status upon initial arrival in the United States was something other than refugee.\n\nThree of these six foreign-born residents of New Hampshire diagnosed with active TB in 2015 had an immigrant visa as their immigration status at first entry into the United States, according to the CDC publication Reported Tuberculosis in the United States, 2015. One arrived on a student visa, one arrived on an employment visa, and one arrived as an asylee/parolee.\n\nBreitbart News asked the New Hampshire Department of Health & Human Services why\u00a0such a high percentage of total TB in New Hampshire is diagnosed in refugees.\n\n\u201cWhen there are as few TB patients as in New Hampshire, proportions may seem high and reporting such may be misleading,\u201d the spokesperson responded.\n\n\u201cThe total number of TB diagnoses among our refugees is very low,\u201d the spokesperson concluded.\n\nBut the pattern of high rates of active TB diagnosed among refugees in the state of New Hampshire is not a one-time \u201cblip,\u201d or data outlier, experienced only in 2015.\n\nIn 2014, for instance, four refugees resettled in New Hampshire were diagnosed with active TB out of a total of 11 cases diagnosed among New Hampshire residents, according to CDC data. Three U.S.-born residents of New Hampshire were diagnosed with active TB that year, while four foreign-born residents whose initial immigration status upon arrival was something other than refugee were also diagnosed.\n\nIn 2013, four out of the 15 cases of active TB diagnosed in New Hampshire, or 26 percent of all cases, were diagnosed in refugees. Ten cases were \u201cother foreign-born\u201d and one was U.S.-born. A stunning 93 percent of all cases of TB diagnosed that year in the state were foreign-born.\n\nIn 2012, one out of 9 cases of active TB diagnosed in New Hampshire, or 11 percent of all cases, wase diagnosed in a refugee. Nine cases were \u201cother foreign-born\u201d and none were U.S.-born. One hundred percent of all cases of TB diagnosed that year in the state were foreign-born.\n\nBreitbart News asked the the New Hampshire Department of Health & Human Services if \u201cNH DPHS does not distinguish among categories of foreign-born because our public health interventions are not different,\u201d how then, did the CDC determine that \u201c3 of these 11 foreign-born individuals diagnosed with TB in 2015 were refugees\u201d if the state of New Hampshire did not provide this data on refugees to them.\n\nThe New Hampshire Department of Health & Human Services has not yet responded to that inquiry.\n\nThe \u00a0CDC states that data used in its annual publication Reported Tuberculosis in the United States is provided directly by the states:\n\nReporting areas (i.e., the 50 states, the District of Columbia (DC), New York City, Puerto Rico, and other U.S. jurisdictions in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea) provide information regarding tuberculosis (TB) cases to CDC's National TB Surveillance System (NTSS) by using a standard case report form, Report of Verified Case of Tuberculosis (RVCT).\n\nWhen asked if the state of New Hampshire has a plan to effectively deal with this refugee TB issue, the spokesperson for the New Hampshire Department of Health & Human Services did offer a response.\n\n\u201cTB is an important but treatable and curable disease. NH DPHS continues to comprehensively address management of TB in accordance with national guidelines through testing for and treating of TB infections; surveillance; and education of healthcare providers,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cThese strategies apply to all NH residents whether U.S.-born or foreign-born,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nIncoming New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, the first Republican to hold that office in twelve years, \u00a0may want to consider establishing a new common sense TB control strategy: not resettling refugees from high TB burden countries in the state.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 36, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.4953789710998504, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1025, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 3, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 10.1745103645, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 36, "mft_sum": 50, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170113220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.878048780487799, "mft_mean": 4.54545454545}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/12/05/madonna-female-trump-voters-betrayed-us/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [215, 220, 992, 1016, 1226, 1288, 1305, 1372, 1411, 1420, 1579, 2059, 3339, 3348, 3362, 3373], "\u00ad": [451, 2203, 2224, 2392, 2552, 3271]}}, "headline": "\u2018Devastated\u2019 Madonna Breaks Down Over Trump: \u2018Haven\u2019t Had a Good Night\u2019s Sleep\u2019 Since Election", "wordcount_as_scraped": 541, "date": "20161205230000", "story_content": "Madonna unloaded her thoughts about the presidential election, Donald Trump, ageism and her personal life in an interview\u00a0with\u00a0actress Elizabeth Banks for Billboard magazine published Monday.\n\nThe 58-year-old pop icon said it felt like \u201csomeone died\u201d after Trump defeated her preferred presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, in November.\n\n\u201cIt felt like a \u00adcombination of the heartbreak and betrayal you feel when someone you love more than anything leaves you, and also a death,\u201d the singer told Billboard. \u201cI feel that way every morning; I wake up and say, \u2018Oh, wait, Donald Trump is still the president,\u2019 and it wasn't a bad dream that I had.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt feels like women betrayed us. The percentage of women who voted for Trump was insanely high,\u201d she added, joining others who have criticized other women for voting for Trump, including actress Lena Dunham.\n\nMadonna\u2019s interview with Banks occurred\u00a0just before her raunchy\u00a0charity fundraiser in Miami, Florida but nearly a month after the presidential election.\n\n\u201cWomen hate women. Women's nature is not to support other women. It's really sad,\u201d the \u201cMaterial Girl\u201d said.\n\nMadonna\u2019s\u00a0support for Clinton was no secret. The singer had promised to\u00a0perform oral sex\u00a0on anyone who had voted for the Democratic presidential candidate.\u00a0Just days before Election Day, Madonna\u00a0implored\u00a0her 8.3 million Instagram followers to \"vote Clinton or we are all F*CKED.\"\n\nShe believes women failed to vote for Hillary out of \u201cjealousy\u201d and \u201csome sort of\u00a0tribal inability to accept that one of their kind could lead a nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cOther people just didn't bother to vote because they didn't like either candidate, or they didn't think Trump had a chance in the world,\u201d Madonna said. \u201cThey took their hands off the wheel and then the car crashed.\u201d\n\nThe election results left Madonna \u201cdevastated, surprised, in shock,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cI haven't really had a good night's sleep since he has been elected. We're f*cked.\u201d\n\nThe singer said\u00a0she met Trump 20 years ago during a photo shoot at the President-elect\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\n\u201cHe's a very friendly guy, \u00adcharismatic in that \u00adboastful, macho, alpha-male way,\u201d Madonna said of meeting Trump. \u201cI found his political incorrectness amusing. Of course, I didn't know he was going to be running for \u00adpresident 20 years later.\u201d\n\nHowever, she still doesn\u2019t think people like Trump should be \u201cheads of state.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just can't put him and Barack Obama in the same \u00adsentence, same room, same job description,\u201d she said. \u201cWe're the laughing stock of the universe right now.

And yet to not speak out carries its own punishment,\u201d the couple writes, \u201cfor it is only through public pressure that we've been able to get our government's attention.\u201d\n\nThe Holts argue that they have not received proper attention\u00a0from the U.S. government \u201cbecause a foreign government and not a terrorist group holds our son,\u201d and the legal framework for hostage crises is designed for cases involving non-state actors.\u201d\n\nAdding insult to injury, Laurie Holt told local news earlier this month\u00a0that officials had told her family Holt would return with\u00a0Secretary of State for Political Affairs Tom Shannon, currently assigned to a special envoy role with the Venezuelan socialist regime. Shannon reportedly made a personal plea to dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to allow him to take Holt home.\n\nShannon has told reporters that he believes dialogue between the Venezuelan dictatorship and the pro-democracy opposition will only be possible if the government releases its prisoners of conscience, though most of these are Venezuelan nationals active in the opposition. \u201cIn many ways, the government holds the key to success in this dialogue because they keep detained these prisoners\u2026 for the process to be a success [the government] must deal with the political prisoner situation.\u201d\n\nHolt is one of twelve American citizens currently kept as a hostage in Venezuela. Not all their names are public, though at least one other family, that of\u00a0Todd Michael Leininger, has gone public with their story.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s government enjoys close ties with two nations that\u00a0have used U.S. citizen\u00a0hostage-taking as a lucrative fundraising maneuver: Iran and Cuba. The U.S. government paid Tehran\u00a0$400 million\u00a0in a deal for the freedom of\u00a0The Washington Post journalist\u00a0Jason Rezaian, Marine veteran Amir Hekmati, Christian pastor Saeed Abedini, and Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari. The White House rejected using the term \u201cransom\u201d for this exchange.\u201d In 2014, Cuba agreed to release political prisoner Alan Gross\u00a0in exchange for the liberation of the remaining communist spies in the group known\u00a0as \u201cThe Cuban Five,\u201d as well as\u00a0the removal of a variety of business sanctions that would net Havana millions in trade and tourism.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.13266754150391, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 637, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.30289129538, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161105020000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 1, "mft_mean": 2.0, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 3.4536891679748796, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/01/27/blue-state-blues-mainstream-media-orwells-big-brother/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [320, 411, 420, 429, 736, 958, 1023, 1036, 1088, 1151, 1340, 1448, 1468, 1575, 1633, 2030, 2120, 2234, 2238, 2397, 2528, 2542, 2880, 2912, 2916, 3572, 3884, 4054, 4392, 4419, 4540, 4740, 5264]}}, "headline": "Blue State Blues: The Mainstream Media Are Orwell\u2019s Big Brother", "wordcount_as_scraped": 874, "date": "20170127220000", "story_content": "The regime in George Orwell's \"1984\" declared \"War is Peace \u2014 Freedom is Slavery \u2014 Ignorance is Strength.\" The dystopian fiction drew flocks of book buyers after Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway's comment about \"alternative facts.\"SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\u2013\u00a0Los Angeles Times, Jan. 25, 2017\n\n\nThe media, and the left in general, are taking pride in\u00a0sales of\u00a0Orwell\u2019s\u00a0Nineteen Eighty-Four, as if these confirm their fantasies about Donald Trump as a totalitarian leader. One wonders if they have read the book.\n\nOrwell\u2019s novel is an attack on socialism, and particularly on the media\u2019s role in an imagined socialist state.\n\nThe lead character, Winston Smith, is a bureaucrat\u00a0in the Ministry of Truth whose role it is to rewrite history to suit the political preferences of the Party, and to destroy historical evidence that contradicts the official narrative.\n\n(It is a state, interestingly, that\u00a0suppresses gender roles to control sex. Only in a forbidden, and\u00a0subversively\u00a0traditional, sexual liaison does Smith briefly find\u00a0refuge.)\n\nOne hopes, therefore, that the people rushing to buy\u00a0Nineteen Eighty-Four because they see it as some kind of talking point against the Trump administration will actually read the novel.\n\nPerhaps they will be shocked by the parallels between\u00a0the Two Minutes Hate \u2014 an organized demonstration of outrage against a largely imagined adversary \u2014 and the\u00a0unhinged anti-Trump\u00a0protests last weekend.\n\nPerhaps they will be alarmed at the degree to which our media also serve a \u201cParty\u201d\u00a0\u2014 voluntarily.\n\nMore likely, however, their new copies of\u00a0Nineteen Eighty-Four will sit on their relatively empty bookshelves, right next to the U.S. Constitutions they bought after Khizr Khan waved his copy from the podium at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nNothing in the Constitution prevents the U.S. from excluding aliens on the basis of objectionable religious or political beliefs \u2014 indeed, we do it already and have done it for decades \u2014 but\u00a0you have to read the thing to know that, and few apparently did.\n\nThe \u201chook\u201d on which the\u00a0supposed Orwellian analogy hangs is \u201cKellyanne Conway\u2019s comment [to NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd] about \u2018alternative facts.'\u201d\u00a0The\u00a0phrase has been distorted to mean the opposite of what Conway intended.\n\nIn any legal dispute, opposing sides will present the court with alternative versions\u00a0of the facts in the case. That is clearly what Conway meant. But the media, and the left, spun \u201calternative facts\u201d as if she meant\u00a0\u201calternatives\u00a0to fact,\u201d i.e. deliberate lies, reckless disregard of the truth.\n\nRecall that NBC \u2014 the network on which Conway appeared \u2014 was the network that selectively edited the audio of the 911 call by George Zimmerman to police in February 2012 to make it appear that Zimmerman had targeted Trayvon Martin because of his race. That deliberate lie\u00a0put Zimmerman\u2019s liberty at risk\u00a0and\u00a0inflamed race relations nationwide.\n\nMore recently, it was Todd himself who declared in October \u2014 citing Republicans, but clearly in agreement \u2014 that the presidential race was \u201cover.\u201d\n\nIt is true that Trump is prone to exaggeration. It is also true that there is usually some basis for his claims.\n\nRecall the furore over his claim that \u201cthousands\u201d of Muslims in New Jersey celebrated the 9/11 terror attacks. The media treated the claim as if Trump had simply made it up. But it turned out to be based on a kernel of truth: there had, in fact, been some limited 9/11 celebrations. And Trump correctly recalled that there had been a local news report that\u00a0had shaped his impression of events.\n\nLikewise with the crowd size at the inauguration. From the steps of the Capitol, and even near the front of the ceremony, it would have been nearly impossible to see any gaps in the crowd. A high-resolution photograph by CNN confirms that fact.\n\nAnd yet the gaps did exist:\u00a0Trump\u2019s crowd on the Mall was almost certainly not as large as Obama\u2019s in 2009. But that cannot, and does not, negate the administration\u2019s claim that more people watched\u00a0overall, through electronic media. Both can be true.\n\nSometimes you need the \u201calternative facts\u201d \u2014 what journalists used to call \u201cboth sides of the story\u201d \u2014 to paint the full picture. But the mainstream media presume that the Trump administration doesn\u2019t have a side \u2014 nor do Trump\u2019s voters and supporters.\n\nInstead, the mainstream media\u00a0have taken the other side.\u00a0They dress it up in platitudes about holding the new administration accountable \u2014 as if, just like Nineteen Eighty-Four,\u00a0the past eight years of servility can be shoved down the \u201cMemory Hole.\u201d\n\nWhile the mainstream media were nitpicking over crowd size, and fabricating stories like the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. bust,\u00a0Breitbart News \u2014 falsely impugned as Trump\u2019s \u201cPravda\u201d \u2014 was taking the administration to task over its failure to address the immigration issue on day one. Earlier, Breitbart reported Trump\u2019s broken promise to pursue Hillary Clinton\u2019s email scandal.\n\nThe truth is that the mainstream media, collectively, are Big Brother. Unlike Winston Smith, we have finally been liberated.\n\nJoel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News. He was named one of the \"most influential\" people in news media in 2016.

Wade Supreme Court decision more than 57 million babies have been legally aborted in the United States, the Cardinal asked: \"Isn't this something we should be apologizing for?\"\n\nCardinal Napier also retweeted a comment Tuesday regarding the Obama's attacks on religious liberty in the United States. \"l'll mainly remember Obama using the overwhelming coercive power of the State against the Little Sisters of The Poor,\" the tweet reads.\n\n\nI\u2019ll mainly remember Obama using the overwhelming coercive power of the State against the Little Sisters of The Poor. #ObamaFarewell https://t.co/F5uWaVQvMi\n\u2014 C.

The legacy is that whoever you are, if you love America, if you want to be our friend, this administration will abandon you and will weaken you.\"\n\n\"Remember, the people who helped President Obama get elected were sent by this administration to Israel, to try to defeat the re-election of Prime Minister Netanyahu,\" he pointed out. \"That tells you everything.\" \n\nHe continued:\n\nIf you are inimical to U.S. values, if you are a terrorist-sponsoring state like Iran, if you are an individual or a nation, a leader, that rejects everything the Founding Fathers fought for, then you will be mollycoddled. You will be assisted. You will be empowered. That is the Alice in Wonderland world of U.S. foreign policy in the last eight years.\n\n\"And I don't know about you guys, but I just can't wait for January the 20th because we're going to do a 180 with this nation. We will treat our friends as friends, and our enemies will be on notice,\" Gorka anticipated.\n\nHe believes\u00a0the Obama administration \"simply can't help themselves\" when it comes to making trouble for both Israel and the incoming Trump team.\n\n\"They can't resist. They're so driven by their partisan ideology,\" he said, adding:\n\nI asked a friend of mine, who's a senior State Department official, and he was really for this. He said, \u201cWow, we really showed \u2019em this time.\u201d And I said, \"Does it change anything? Is it going to bring us a solution?\u201d And he said, \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d Then what are you talking about? Why did you do this? Totally unnecessary.\n\n\"In medicine, there's something called the Hippocratic Oath. And it says, whatever you're going to do as a doctor, your first rule is 'do no harm.' This administration, it's the opposite,\u201d said Gorka. \u201cWhatever we do, turn over the table, throw gasoline on the fire, throw firecrackers into the room. It simply is the opposite of common sense, and it has to be ideological.\"\n\nHe said ongoing U.S. financial support for Israel, such as the recent $38 billion aid package, was \"just another piece of how schizophrenic this administration is.\"\n\n\"Remember, this is the administration that was, 'We're gonna lead from behind.' That was our bumper sticker. Wars in the Middle East are bad,\" Gorka recalled. \"What did the Obama administration do? In the first nine months of the Obama administration, the first nine months, this anti-war president killed more people with drone strikes than President Bush did in four years.\"\n\n\"This is the lack of consistency. It's the dangerous mix of when you add ignorance to arrogance,\" he said. \"When you add those two things together, this is what you get.\"\n\nGorka's advice for incoming President Trump began with acknowledging that \"the resolutions of the Security Council are raised to the level of international law, so there's nothing we can do about that unilaterally.\"\n\n\"However, as the highest donor to the United Nations, as the most important, powerful nation in the world, we have a lot of leverage,\" he asserted, adding:\n\nThe people who supported this, the ten nations who supported this, will be punished \u2013 whether it's economically, whether it's diplomatically, or whether it's just rhetorically. They will be frozen out, at least for a period of time. That's clear from just the statements made already by President-elect Trump.\n\n\"What can we do in the Middle East? In the Middle East, the first thing that has to be done \u2013 and I've been saying this again and again and again. I've told General Flynn, other people on the transition team, look, the first the we have to do is, we have to win back our friends,\" Gorka declared. \n\n\"There are people bleeding right now, Muslims bleeding for us and for our values in the Middle East,\" he explained. \"Remember that Jordanian fighter pilot, burned alive by ISIS. The nations of the Middle East that should be our friends, like Jordan, like Egypt, have been completely neglected and abandoned sometimes \u2013 like Egypt \u2013 by this administration.\" \n\n\"The first thing the new Commander-in-Chief has to do is to build back those relationships because they have to trust us if we are going to stabilize the Middle East. And that's what I expect Donald Trump to do,\" he advised.\n\nAs for the timing of Obama's betrayal of Israel at the United Nations, Gorka said he couldn't speak for the administration's strategists, but thought the most obvious explanation might be accurate: \"sheer bloody-mindedness.\"\n\n\"They're doing it because they can do it,\" he ventured. \"They want to send a message to all those people who are with them, who think that Israel is the evil force in the Middle East, and despite being surrounded by millions and millions of people who wish to do it harm, that somehow they are the dark force of the region.\" \n\n\"For somebody that lives in the real world, that understands who our true friends are, I have no explanation for you. Please, knock on the door of the White House,\" he suggested.\n\nAsked to guess if Obama was more interested in settling old scores with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or making life difficult for President-elect Trump, Gorka replied:\n\nI don't believe in conspiracy theories. I find them immensely entertaining, but they're called \u201ctheories\u201d for a reason, because they're not facts. And having watched the last eight years, I don't see Machiavellian strategists in the White House.

They're very anti-Semitic, anti-Christian. They divide the world into the land of Islam and the land of war. But that ideology is not monitored. All we're monitoring is trying to figure out when they're all of a sudden going to become violent, and most of them only demonstrate that a few hours or, at most, a few days, before they commit the act.\" \n\n\"That's why we need to start monitoring the public footprint of political Islam, and what is that? It's the grievance groups that say Muslims are discriminated against and that the West is Islamophobic,\" said Jasser. \"It's the anti-Semitism. It's the misogyny, where women are treated as second-class citizens, and you see them talking about the right to wear the veil, rather than the right for women to have independence and bodily autonomy.\" \n\n\"All these things that the governments of France and Germany and Britain and the U.S. would perceive as simply shades of theology need to be monitored and looked at in a public footprint perspective. Then you'd be able to say, 'Oh, these are the guys that could become militarized or operationalized.' Otherwise, there's no way to predict it,\" he warned. \"They're using such unconventional means now, since ISIS is telling them to use trucks and knives and things that would not be able to be monitored, that we have to be looking at the precursor ideologies \u2013 which is the hate for the West, the hate for the system that really is out there.\" \n\n\"As you know, in the work that I do, I attract most of these barbaric Islamists. Look at the Paris attacks. The Paris attacks occurred in November, and in March, the same cell committed a second act. These guys hid out in Islamist insurgent communities. Not militant communities, but insurgent communities that protected them from the police. That tells you how big the problem is. And this guy now is probably similar. I guarantee you he's not hiding out in churches or synagogues,\" Jasser said.\n\nKassam spotlighted the recent media frenzy over a Muslim prankster allegedly getting kicked off an airplane, allegedly just because he spoke in Arabic, although he has been called out for staging a hate-crime hoax. Kassam contended there were real acts of discrimination against Muslims, but their number is much smaller than activists and hoaxers claim.\n\n\"Does this make it easier or harder for everyday Muslims?\" he asked.\n\n\"I can't tell you how much harder it makes it,\" Jasser replied. \"We, right away, on my Twitter feed and on Facebook, exposed quickly that this guy was a prankster, and obviously, he had been outed as a hoax he had committed in 2014, and was just trying to get attention as a YouTuber. People may say he's not an Islamist, but this is the first stage, 101 or 201 of Islamism, which is to exploit a non-Muslim society, to exploit its vulnerability \u2013 which is the protection of minorities \u2013 and then mock it, separate Muslims out of that society into our own consciousness.\" \n\n\"So what happens is, by mocking it and exploiting it, and then saying. \u2018Oh, he was discriminated and kicked off,\u2019 but actually lying about it, not only is it a 'crying wolf' phenomenon, where those who may be discriminated against are going to be ignored, but it soaks up the bandwidth of what we should be doing,\" he explained.\n\n\"I've always said, if you want to melt away any fear of Muslims, the best way is for Americans to see us leading the battle against radicals, for Americans to see us basically recognizing that this is a Muslim problem that needs a Muslim solution,\" he advised. \"Then they'd say, 'Oh, wait a minute: these are our allies;\u00a0they're not our enemies!' But until we do that, these guys are actually radicalizing our community by telling everyone, 'Well, make it up or whatever.'\" \n\n\"Grievances are our biggest problem,\" Jasser mused. \"The elephant in the room, even from the discussion you and I just had on Berlin, is that our so-called allies \u2013 the Islamic Republic of Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, these huge cauldrons of tens and hundreds of millions of Islamists that believe in the Islamic State \u2013 want to separate the world into good and evil, Islam being good and the rest being evil. Unless we address that primary theocracy \u2013 which is a mentality that secular society is evil, and if you live here, then, well, Americans hate you, et cetera \u2013 those types of mentalities can't be defeated.\" \n\n\"We have to abandon that and say, \u2018You know what? We're done with the grievance mills. They are corrupt.\u2019 We need to no longer identify as a collective as Muslims, but identify as Americans first.

Elated tourists and local Christians alike wandered around the square illuminated by festive red and golden lights and a large Christmas tree, visiting souvenir shops and restaurants.\n\nAdding to the holiday spirit for the Palestinians, locals celebrated a key diplomatic victory at the United Nations the day before, where the Security Council passed a resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.\n\nSharolyn Knight, a 28-year-old teacher from Georgia, said she was in Bethlehem for the first time and experiencing mixed emotions. \u201cIt\u2019s been sobering and humbling because it\u2019s a place with a lot of heavy stuff, religious and historical. At the same time, disillusioning because there is so much strife in the place where Jesus was born.\u201d\n\nShe said she would come back again, maybe next time with her kids.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very unique, I\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\u201d said Rodrigo Reis, 23, who came from Louisville, Kentucky, \u201cIt\u2019s very meaningful, its Christmas time, where everything started.\u201d\n\nChristian clergymen welcomed the top Roman Catholic cleric in the Holy Land inside the Church of Nativity in Bethlehem, the birth place of Jesus Christ, as Christians worldwide begin to prepare to celebrate Christmas this year.\n\nThe Rev. Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the apostolic administrator of the Latin Patriarchate, is the temporary chief clergyman to the local Catholic population. He traveled from Jerusalem to Bethlehem on Saturday in a traditional procession. Later, he was to celebrate Midnight Mass at the Church of the Nativity, built at the grotto revered as Jesus\u2019 birthplace.\n\n\u201cI wish this joyous atmosphere of Christmas will continue in the year and not just for a few days and I hope the coming year will bring a little more serenity and peaceful relations in our country. We need it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI am happy that the war, at least the military war, in Aleppo is finished and that for the first time in Aleppo the Christians can celebrate without fear the Christmas season. I wish that they can now reconstruct, rebuild the city, not only the infrastructure but also the common relations that was a tradition over there,\u201d he told The Associated Press.\n\nThe Syrian government assumed full control of Aleppo earlier this month when rebels, including some Islamic militants, agreed to withdraw from their last remaining enclave after more than four years of heavy fighting over the country\u2019s largest city.\n\nChristmas festivities brought a boost of holiday cheer to Christians in the Holy Land, who make up just a small percentage of the population. The region has which has experienced a wave of Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed that erupted over a year ago. The violence has tapered off in recent months, but has not halted completely.\n\nRula Maaya, the Palestinian minister of tourism, said all the hotels in Bethlehem were fully booked.\n\n\u201cBethlehem is celebrating today, we are receiving tourists from all over the world,\u201d Maaya said. \u201cAll people over the world are looking at Bethlehem so we hope more and more tourists will come during the year and that next year we will celebrate Christmas without occupation.\u201d\n\nMaaya spoke a day after the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.\n\nJulie Suhain, 20, from Ramallah said she was delighted with the UNSC resolution.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like getting a Christmas gift,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for this for a long time.\u201d\n\nDespite the Christmas cheer, Mideast politics loom large in the background \u2013 the concrete barrier that surrounds parts of Bethlehem is just one hulking reminder. It was built by Israel last decade during the second Intifada, or uprising, when Palestinian suicide bombers attacked buses and cafes.\n\nIsraeli says the barrier is meant to keep out Palestinian attackers, but because it dips inside the West Bank, Palestinians see it as a land grab that also stunts their economy.\n\nSecurity was tight in Bethlehem after recent attacks on Christian targets in Egypt and elsewhere in the region by Islamic extremists.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 720, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 9, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.96536480551, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 4, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161225120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.88888888888889, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/31/top-7-charges-hillary-clinton-could-face-while-president/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [244, 2256, 7178]}}, "headline": "Top 7 Charges Hillary Clinton Could Face While President", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1280, "date": "20161101060000", "story_content": "What scandals might the American people find themselves dealing with in Hillary Clinton's Administration if she slides into the presidential home plate, trailing a cloud of controversy? \n\n\u00a0Let us be honest about who suffers from presidential misbehavior\u2014it's the American people who pay the price, including the literal price of the expensive investigations. The odds of justice actually catching up with Hillary Clinton dwindle to almost zero if she gains the White House. She might have to sacrifice an aide here and there, but if the political system of 1998 couldn't remove her husband from office for blatant perjury, it's hard to imagine what could possibly bring The First Woman President down in the even more corrupt and confused political system of 2017.\n\nThat being said, here are a few lingering legal headaches Clinton could face:\n\n1. Perjury: Why not start with a blast from the Clinton past? Hillary Clinton signed documents testifying that she turned over all work-related emails to the State Department, on orders from a federal judge, under penalty of perjury. We already have indisputable proof she violated this sworn statement\u2026 thousands of times.\n\nThe cloud of false statements under oath surrounding Hillary Clinton is thousands of times thicker than the one around Bill. Democrats seem to have found a hidden clause in the Constitution that says Clintons can never be prosecuted for perjury, but Madame Secretary is really stress-testing that particular privilege of Clintonhood. One would think the federal judiciary had some interest in establishing that sworn documents must be taken seriously.\n\n2. Obstruction of Justice: Bill Clinton's primary motive for committing perjury was to obstruct justice\u2014it was the second count in his impeachment. (The justice he was obstructing was a sexual harassment suit from Paula Jones, at a time when liberals insisted sexual harassment was the most overlooked, under-prosecuted crime in the legal code.)\n\nHillary's thousands of perjury counts are also related to the obstruction of justice. She held back documents she didn't want Congress to see. She subverted the Freedom of Information Act, which is a law, not a lovely suggestion. \u00a0\n\nMost media timelines of the Clinton email scandal are either incomplete or deliberately obtuse, because they almost never accurately relate how her secret server was discovered. For example, these timelines from USA Today, CNN, and ABC News all get it wrong. \n\nSharyl Attkisson, who was a participant in the story, has an accurate timeline that makes the important point Clinton-friendly media outlets don't want to talk about: we know about the secret server because the State Department was sued for failing to respond to FOIA requests. The State Department's official story is that they were surprised to discover Clinton was withholding thousands of documents on her private computer. \n\nThat's straight-up obstruction of justice, in cases involving multiple federal courts, as surely as Bill Clinton's impeachable offense of obstructing the Paula Jones suit. Clinton may become untouchable if the American people allow her into the White House, but the lawsuits don't evaporate, and neither do the angry judges.\n\n3. Bribery: After the FBI set off a headline earthquake by re-opening the Clinton email investigation, we learned that several other FBI investigations of Clintonworld have been quietly in progress for some time. One of those investigations is digging into bribery allegations against the Clinton Foundation. The FBI agents working on these cases were reportedly very angry that top Bureau and Justice Department officials were pressuring them to drop their investigations.\n\nThe most attention-grabbing of these suspicions concerns an FBI official, Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, whose wife received an inexplicably huge political donation from Clinton bagman Terry McAuliffe, currently the governor of Virginia. The timing of this donation was so convenient that even the Left side of the blogosphere has produced some uneasy speculation that McCabe probably should have recused himself from all things Clinton-related.\n\nWell, he didn't recuse himself, and the conflicts of interest are so apparent that the lack of a chiseled-in-stone quid pro quo might not be enough to kill this case off. After all, corrupt officials aren't usually dumb enough to write down their quid pro quo agreements, or repeat them into microphones. The McCabe controversy already has longer legs than most observers expected, when the news first broke.\n\n4. Pay for Play: There has also been recent confirmation that the FBI has investigated influence-peddling allegations against the Clinton Foundation, which was so obviously used for that purpose that it's funny to watch Clinton apologists insist nothing can be proven in a court of law. Some of the most vigorous infighting within the Bureau reportedly concerns whether pay-for-play investigations should move forward.\n\nWikiLeaks has exposed emails from Clinton insiders that openly discuss how the Foundation was part of a network that steered millions of dollars to \"Bill Clinton Inc.\" Even longtime members of the Clinton syndicate professed themselves troubled by these operations. They were also unhappy with arrangements like Hillary Clinton's agreement to speak in Morocco after a $12 million donation to the Clinton Global Initiative.\n\nIt's entirely possible that more documentation about these suspicious Clinton Foundation dealings will come to light after the election, especially if some of the people Clinton took money from grow upset with her. It's downright dangerous to have a President with so many strings attached.\n\n5. Illegal Use of a Nonprofit Organization: There are many laws governing the management of charitable organizations, generally intended to prevent them from becoming money-laundering operations, ripoff operations, and vehicles for political influence peddling. The Clinton Foundation and its galaxy of related operations may eventually find itself answering some questions about compliance with those laws, assuming the IRS decides to stop focusing its efforts on hassling mom-and-pop pro-life groups and kitchen-table Tea Party outfits. If the Foundation is ever held to account for any other impropriety, charges of abusing a nonprofit should be part of the legal package as well.\n\n6. Racketeering: Former prosecutor Andrew McCarthy has recently observed that Hillary Clinton's abuse of the State Department looks an awful lot like a \"racketeering enterprise,\" which could trigger the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1971, more widely known as RICO. McCarthy explained:\n\nUnder RICO, an \u201centerprise\u201d can be any association of people, informal or formal, illegitimate or legitimate \u2013 it could be a Mafia family, an ostensibly charitable foundation, or a department of government. It is a racketeering enterprise if its affairs are conducted through \u201ca pattern of racketeering activity.\u201d A \u201cpattern\u201d means merely two or more violations of federal or state law; these violations constitute \u201cracketeering activity\u201d\u00a0if they are included among the extensive list of felonies laid out in the statute.\n\n7. Fraud: Wall Street analyst Charles Ortel has been building a case that the \"Clinton Charity Network,\" as he calls the complete system of Clinton operations, has committed \"charity fraud of epic proportions.\" In part, he refers to discrepancies between donor accounts and the Clinton Foundation\u2019s books. \n\nOthers have pointed out how the Clinton Health Access Initiative has essentially ignored New York state law for years, without a peep from Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (who just happens to be part of the Clinton campaign's \"leadership council.\") There are some interesting differences between the paperwork CHAI submitted to the IRS and what it submitted to the state of New York, which has more specific requirements about identifying foreign donors.\n\nIn addition to getting a free pass on perjury, the Clintons are traditionally allowed to violate tax laws without penalty, eventually refiling paperwork when \"errors\" are discovered years after the fact. Another round of whoops-my-bad, no-harm-no-foul \"refiling\" during a Hillary Clinton presidency would be embarrassing, especially if she's busy trying to ratchet up taxes on everyone else.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.56379842758179, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1247, "FairnessVirtue": 8, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 13, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.91437275302, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 37, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161101060000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.3636363636400004, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 5, "pct_mft_words": 2.9671210906174803, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2017/01/10/mounted-border-patrol-team-ride-inaugural-parade/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [92, 169, 2755, 3119, 3486, 3647]}}, "headline": "Mounted Border Patrol Team to Ride in Inaugural Parade", "wordcount_as_scraped": 705, "date": "20170110160000", "story_content": "Border Patrol agents on horseback were\u00a0invited to ride in the inaugural parade for President-elect Donald J.

In view of these threats, the National Border Patrol Council endorses Donald J. Trump for President\u2013and asks the American people to support Mr. Trump in his mission to finally secure the border of the United States of America, before it is too late.\"\n\nThe endorsement helped solidify the candidate's authority on border issues making security a top-level priority in the campaign. Two days after his election, the President-elect reiterated his pledge to keep this as a priority issue.\n\n\"A lot of really great priorities. People will be very, very happy. Well, we have a lot. We're looking very strongly at immigration. We're going to look at the borders, very importantly, we're looking very strongly at healthcare and we're looking at jobs,\" Trump\u00a0told reporters after meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI).\n\nThe mounted patrol agents are not just for show. The RGV Sector utilizes nearly 40 horse-mounted agents to patrol areas of the border not easily accessible by other means. The horses were adopted from the Noble Mustang program, officials stated. \u00a0\"Horses have been a valuable asset in securing the border since the inception of the Border Patrol in 1924,\" Border Patrol officials wrote.\n\n\u201cIt is an honor for our horse patrol to be invited to participate in the ceremonial aspects of the inauguration,\u201d Chief Padilla said, \"and to be able to stand alongside other federal and state agencies with pride.\u201d\n\nBob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

So now there is this, it appears to be [a] rapid move to consolidate their control of corporate America \u2013 to use them to be their tool or their weapon of choice,\" Perkins said, putting the Kellogg\u2019s boycott of Breitbart News into the context of the 2016 election.\n\nLISTEN:\n\n\n\n\"So what's happening now with this pushback?\" he asked Solov. \"Did they expect you to push back and have others join, or were they thinking they could just get away with this?\"\n\n\"I think they were thinking they could just get away with this,\" Solov replied. \"I mean, they could have, if they wanted to, stop advertising on our site and frankly not made any announcement about it. But they came out and they made the announcement that they were blacklisting us because Breitbart.com and its readers \u2013 and by the way, we have 45 million readers\u2026\"\n\nPerkins interjected, \"I love to have our articles up there on Breitbart because we get a lot of feedback when they're up there because a lot of our conservative Christian listeners, readers, go to Breitbart for information.\"\n\n\"Yes, and we thank them, and we thank you very much for that,\" said Solov. \"Our 45 million readers, [Kellogg\u2019s]\u00a0said they do not share our values. I don't know what values a cereal company should have, other than producing a great product and making shareholders happy. They of course did not specify what those values were, and they also didn't specify how we don't share those values \u2013 because frankly, Tony, they can't point to anything.\" \n\n\"This is a political hit,\u201d Solov continued. \u201cIt is in part, as you mentioned, because Steve Bannon is now in the White House, and it is an effort to denigrate, I think, the mainstream American values that we hold dear. Breitbart is, as you know, the most pro-family, pro-traditional American values news brand in the English language.\"\n\n\"It's like a different version of Hillary Clinton's 'basket of deplorables,'\" Perkins observed. \"Kellogg\u2019s has their bowl of deplorables, and they're basically dumping this on half of America. I mean, it just doesn't make sense from a corporate standpoint that you just want to insult people who are your customers or potential customers.\"\n\n\"No, it doesn't, and that's why we think it took an extraordinary step by doing so, and why we've called for a boycott of Kellogg\u2019s,\" Solov agreed. \"Because frankly this is an attack, not just on Breitbart, but this is an attack on your listeners and our readers, many of whom are the same.\"\n\n\"You're right, a lot of our material is published on Breitbart. When petitions that we do on religious liberty in the military get to Breitbart, they do extremely well \u2013 because you're right, it's God-fearing Americans who read Breitbart,\" said Perkins. \n\n\"This label, and it's part of this trump card they like to play \u2013 no pun intended there! \u2013 but they like to play this race card. That's their trump card. They're trying to say this [is] some kind of 'white nationalist' entity, Breitbart. I want you to address that,\" he said to Solov.\n\n\"We are, as you know, and as your listeners know, we are not a white supremacist or white nationalist website,\" Solov declared. \"Never have been, are not, never will be. What that is, is an attempt \u2013 and we've seen it come from the Left many times \u2013 an attempt to shut down mainstream conservative thought, because they cannot compete in the realm of ideas. We know that we will win on that basis. They try to marginalize people so that you can't get your ideas out there, and they marginalize you by calling you racist, sexist, and terms like that.\"\n\nPerkins proposed that Donald Trump's success was partly due to the way \"he just bowled right through that.\"\n\n\"He did, and there's some signs because of that, that maybe this long-held, long-gone-to playbook of calling conservatives racist is maybe beginning to lose some of its effectiveness,\" Solov said. \"You made a great point that they tried to do it with President-elect Trump and it did not work. Frankly, they cannot point to a single fact, a single article on Breitbart that is white nationalist, because it has never existed.\"\n\nSolov invited Washington Watch listeners to visit Breitbart.com and sign the petition that appears on the right-hand side of the page, to \"let Kellogg's know that this is not acceptable, and that we are traditional values people, and we're not going to take it.\"\n\nPerkins concluded by repeating his warning that the Left would \"try to use corporate America to marginalize and bash conservative thought,\" now that they are out of power.\n\nYou can listen to the complete audio of the interview above.\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.85399770736694, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 779, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 8, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.42234774445, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 18, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161206190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.31065468549422, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.63636363636}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2017/01/13/santa-fe-leaders-narrowly-defeat-resolution-rejecting-trump-wall/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1655, 1686, 4563, 4759, 5934, 6071, 7129, 7263], "\u00a7": [6773]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1053, "scraper_regex": 1171}}, "headline": "Santa Fe Leaders Narrowly Defeat Resolution Rejecting Trump Wall", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1171, "date": "20170113150000", "story_content": "The Santa Fe City Council narrowly failed to pass a controversial resolution that denounced many of the policies of the incoming presidential administration and would have defiantly resolved that the City would \u201ccontinue to be a sanctuary city.\u201d The resolution also expressly rejected the idea of building a wall at the U.S.-Mexico Border, and mentioned President-Elect Donald Trump by name. The vote was 4-4 with one abstention.\n\nBreitbart Texas reported on January 4 that the capital city of the State of Enchantment was doubling down on its sanctuary status even at the risk of losing federal funds. The article discussed the City\u2019s back-and-forth history of being a sanctuary city going back to 1986. The resolution being discussed at that time included policies that would keep the immigration status of any person confidential and would refuse access to city property by immigration officials.\n\n\"This is doubling down,\" City Council Member Joseph Maestas, the Albuquerque Journal reported on January 3, \"We're thumbing our nose at this incoming administration.\"\n\nIn reference to the possible loss of federal funding, former Santa Fe Mayor David Cross told the council, \"If that's all we're worried about, shame on us. That's not what Santa Fe is about.\" Cross was reported to say that if the City did not stand up to the potential federal government action, 400 years of progress would be erased.\n\nThe resolution on the City\u2019s agenda on Wednesday night began with:\n\nWHEREAS, on November 8, 2016, Donald Trump was elected to become the 45th President of the United States; and \nWHEREAS,\u00a0President-Elect Trump has made\u00a0threats to Sanctuary Cities such as the City of Santa Fe; and espouses beliefs that are contrary to and undermine our community values \u2026var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([\"embed\"]);\n\nIf passed, the resolution would have provided that \u201cThe city of Santa Fe will continue to be a sanctuary city that protects and values immigrants as part of the unique fabric of our community.\u201d\n\nThe resolution stated that the City of Santa Fe would expressly:\n\nreject the idea of adding to the physical barriers at the boundary between the US and Mexico, and also reject the premise that our neighbors south of the border are threats to the safety livelihood; and consider that premise contrary to our core American ideal of welcoming immigrants and also contrary to our history of old and new Mexicans working side by side for the benefit of both.\n\nThe resolution was on the agenda to be submitted to a vote of the city council in the New Mexico town on Wednesday evening. Councilors Joseph M. Maestas and Renee D. Villarreal sponsored the resolution.\n\nIf passed, the resolution would have also \u201ccondemn[ed] any discrimination and disparate treatment of individuals and groups on the basis of religion,\u201d affirmed its support for the Affordable Care Act (\u201cObamacare\u201d), and reaffirmed its commitment to rehabilitating and reforming non-violent offenders. It also had a provision which stated \u201cwe believe in women\u2019s rights and condemn the demeaning and objectification of women.\u201d It also addressed climate change stating that, \u201cwe believe climate change exists and is caused by increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels; and we strive to achieve comprehensive, environmental sustainability with an overall goal of reaching carbon neutrality by the year 2040.\u201d\n\nThe resolution itself refers to the City of Santa Fe as having \u201cbeen a national leader in progressive values, striving to ensure a fair and just community.\u201d\n\nBreitbart Texas spoke with Councilor Joseph Maestas on Thursday morning after the vote. He said the resolution was narrowly defeated and that some thought the resolution was redundant. Yet, given the \u201cpotential threats, he thought it important to relay the City\u2019s long-held support of sanctuary city policies and to relay fears and concerns in the community by reaffirming the City\u2019s values.\n\nMaestas said the measure was \u201chighly symbolic whose timing was right.\u201d\n\nDuring the month before the vote after the resolution was filed, Councilor Maestas tweeted:\n\nProud to intro a resolution affirming Santa Fe's status as a \"sanctuary\" for immigrants and calling for stronger policies to reinforce it.\n\u2014 Joseph Maestas (@JosephMaestas2) December 15, 2016\n\n\n\nAlso proud to intro a resolution reaffirming Santa Fe's commitment to its progressive values.\n\u2014 Joseph Maestas (@JosephMaestas2) December 15, 2016\n\n\n\nItem #13 on the council agenda\u00a0styled \u201cA Resolution Reaffirming the City of Santa Fe\u2019s Commitment to Its Values; and to the Values Set Forth in the Constitutions of the United States and New Mexico\u201d would have been nonbinding.\u00a0Although nonbinding, it would have required that the resolution be forwarded to: U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan; U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell; the members of U.S. Congress from the state; New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez; and the state legislators that represent the City of Santa Fe.\n\nBefore the vote, City Councilor Chris Rivera was reported to note that the resolution expressly included the President-elect\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it needs to be personal like that,\u201d Councilor Rivera said. \u201cIf the City wants to reaffirm what it did back in \u201999 [when it adopted a sanctuary city policy], that\u2019s fine. But I\u2019m not sure that it has to be so personal.\u201d\n\nDuring the debate on the resolution, Maestas said the mayor asked how to translate these progressive policies into action. Maestas told Breitbart Texas that legislation was coming that would affirm and reaffirm its sanctuary and immigration policies. It will also strengthen existing policies. Maestas said that a measure has unanimously passed through the City\u2019s immigration advisory committee and is now going to be submitted to the finance committee on January 17th. If approved, it will be submitted\u00a0before the City Council on January 25th.\n\nJim Harrington, a retired attorney who has volunteered with Somos un Pueblo Unido was reported\u00a0on January 3 to have said that the passage of that resolution would \u201cpu[t] us in a more defensible position than current sanctuary policies.\u201d He was reported to reason that the U.S. Supreme Court has restricted how the federal government can use funding cuts to enforce policy.\n\nAs reported by Breitbart Texas:\n\nUnder existing law, the Department of Justice (DOJ) can move quickly to not only cut off future law enforcement grants to the city\u2013it can recoup past grants for any period of time the municipality was not 100 percent compliant with federal immigration law, according to U.S. Representative John Culberson (R-TX).\nCulberson spent most of 2016 working with DOJ officials to enforce 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373, a law that passed in 1996 to require local and state jurisdictions to cooperate with immigration officials or risk losing federal funding, Breitbart Texas previously reported. \"The law requires cooperation with immigration officials 100 percent of the time,\" Culberson said in an exclusive interview with Breitbart Texas in November.\n\nLana Shadwick\u00a0is a writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

Look, Islamic extremism is a threat to us all. But as Jews, we know what it means to be registered and tagged, held out as different from our fellow citizens. As Jews, we know the righteous and just response. All of us have heard the story of the Danish king who said if his country\u2019s Jews had to wear a gold star \u2026 all of Denmark would too.\nSo I pledge to you right here and now, because I care about the fight against anti-Semitism, that if one day in these United States, if one day Muslim-Americans will be forced to register their identities, then that is the day that this proud Jew will register as a Muslim.\n\n\n(The story of the Danish king, however inspiring, is not actually true.)\n\nWhat the Trump transition team has actually proposed is something like an existing system that the George W. Bush administration used after 9/11 to track foreigners from certain countries, and which the Obama administration discontinued.\n\nThe Bush administration started the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS) in 2002, following the aftermath of the devastating September 11, 2001 attacks on America. Before it was discontinued, in 2011,\u00a0NSEERS had\u00a0registered over\u00a093,000 people\u00a0who were seen \u201cpossible national security threats.\u201d\n\nThe move allowed the\u00a0U.S. government to record and track the movements of individuals who traveled to America from 25 countries \u2014 including majority-Muslim countries like Afghanistan, Algeria, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Libya and Saudi Arabia.\n\nSome of the individuals caught under NSEERS included \u201ctwo suspected al Qaeda operatives who were caught trying to enter the U.S. after their fingerprints matched ones lifted by our military officials from papers found in Afghanistan caves\u201d and \u201ca\u00a0Tunisian convicted of multiple drug-trafficking offenses, in addition to previous violations of immigration law.\u201d\n\nFACTS about the NSEERS registry.

Trump later\u00a0clarified\u00a0that it was a reporter who had first posed the suggestion.\n\nOn Wednesday, a spokesman, and former Navy Seal, for a pro-Trump PAC suggested a registry could be recommended for immigrants from Muslim countries. \u201cWe would like to keep tabs on it until we can figure out what\u2019s going on,\u201d the man said during an interview with Megyn Kelly of Fox News.\n\nThe sold-out crowd at the ADL conference drew over 1,000 participants. The two-day event will continue\u00a0on Friday.\n\nIn his speech, Greenblatt pointed to a history of prejudice and marginzalization the Jewish people had endured, and pointed to that as a common struggle linking the Jews and other minorities. \u201cIt\u2019s our fight,\u201d he said. \u201cJust as the fight against anti-Semitism is not only the fight of us Jews. It\u2019s everyone\u2019s fight.\u201d\n\nHe noted that some of his decisions would be met equally with\u00a0support and resistance, saying \u201cmaking powerful enemies is the price one must pay, at times, for speaking truth to power.\u201d He added, \u201cNow, it will not be easy. It may be extremely difficult at times. There will be those in our country and even those in our community who disagree\u200a\u2014\u200asometimes strongly. But I welcome their disagreement.

As the boat drew within range, several foreign nationals began throwing rocks at the agents, according to information obtained by Breitbart Texas from U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials.\n\nThe agents did not respond with any use of force despite the threat of severe injury or death from the assault. The people on the Mexican side of the river eventually left the area.\n\nNo damage was done to the boat and the agents on-board were not injured, officials stated.\n\nJust one week earlier, agents working this same area on Thanksgiving day faced a similar encounter, Breitbart Texas reported. In this incident, a group of three foreign nationals began throwing rocks at the agents on the riverboat. Again, no agents were injured and the boat was not damaged.\n\nThe following day, a Border Patrol agent and a Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) trooper were each shot near the border town of Fronton, Texas. The DPS trooper was shot in the leg and was transported by helicopter to a hospital in McAllen, Breitbart Texas\u00a0reported. The wound was not life-threatening. Investigators could not initially determine if the two were shot intentionally or if they were hit by stray bullets from a gun battle on the Mexican side.\n\nTrooper III Denny Shaw, normally assigned to Kaufman County, was on temporary assignment to patrol the border and was working directly with Border Patrol agents when the shooting began. A bullet entered the trooper\u2019s pelvic area and exited through his right thigh, Shaw's wife Melissa told inForney.com. Kaufman County is located just east of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex on U.S. Highway 80.\n\n\"[Danny] is doing well, in good spirits, and feeling very blessed,\" she told the Kaufman County news outlet. \"His doctor said he is one very lucky man.\"\n\nA Border Patrol agent was also shot in the chest during the attack, but his ballistic vest stopped the bullet from causing severe injury or possible death.\n\nBreitbart Texas has reported extensively on assaults on Border Patrol agents. In recent testimony before Congress, the newly appointed chief of the Border Patrol, Mark Morgan, told Senators on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that assaults on agents are increasing. He also stated that 30 Border Patrol agents have died in the line of duty since 2003.\n\nAs an example, Breitbart Texas reported that eight agents assigned to the El Centro Sector in southern California were assaulted by rock throwers during the first month of this fiscal year. Several agents sustained injuries including one agent who was struck in the eye socket.\n\nMorgan testified that Border Patrol agents are the most assaulted federal law enforcement officers in the U.S.: \"More than 7,400 Border Patrol agents have been assaulted since 2006.

Trump \u201cwalks into the Oval Office with a more intimate relationship with the Jewish people than any other president in the history of the United States of America.\u201d\n\nGreenblatt made the statement while participating in a \u201cdinner-style information conversation\u201d about political and Jewish values at the\u00a0Shalehevet High School in Los Angeles on Tuesday night.\n\nThe event was moderated by\u00a0Danielle Berrin, a senior writer and columnist for the Jewish Journal, who \u2014 among other questions \u2014 asked the\u00a0panelists how think the Trump administration will either exemplify or contravene Jewish values.\n\nGreenblatt said, \u201cwe don\u2019t yet know.\u201d He added, \u201cI think it is worth nothing that whether you like this President-elect or not\u2026 This man walks into the Oval Office with a more intimate relationship with the Jewish people than any other president in the history of the United States of America. So I just wanted to point that out.\u201d He added his belief that \u201cthe notion of having children who are \u2018shomer Shabbas\u2019 [Sabbath observant] in the First Family is pretty remarkable.\u201d\n\nThe panelists were critical of Trump overall, although there were a few\u00a0glimmers of positive comment. Rabbi Ari Segal, who heads the Shalhevet Institute, said, \u201cWhether you like him or hate him, he did show empathy in this election; maybe not for everybody. But for the states \u2014 Michigan,\u00a0Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin \u2014 he showed more empathy for them than Hillary Clinton did.\u201d\n\nSegal also pointed out that many students voted for Trump in a mock election the school held, which caused him to have \u201d a moment of deep\u00a0self-reflection.\u201d He said lots of people who \u201cplanned on voting for Donald Trump\u00a0went into the voting booth knowing they were going to vote for Trump, but they didn\u2019t tell anybody,\u201d referring to what is known as the \u201cSilent Majority.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI\u2019ll take it as a moment to pat the students of Shelhevet on the back\u2026 I take it as a badge of honor that the students of Shalhevet have created a \u2018safe space\u2019.\u201d Siegel went on to say, \u201cI wish we had communities that weren\u2019t echo chambers.\u201d\n\nDan Schnur, a political analyst and director of USC\u2019s Unruh Institute of Politics, touted the fact that the USC Dornsife /\u00a0Los Angeles\u00a0Times\u00a0poll was the only major poll that correctly predicted Trump\u2019s win.\n\nBerrin asked Greenblatt to address accusations that the ADL has become a partisan organization. \u201cI would challenge the claim that we are somehow more partisan today,\u201d Greenblatt said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not \u2026 I\u2019m an easy target for those kinds of accusations. I worked of the Obama administration,\u201d Greenblatt noted. \u201cFull disclosurr: I worked in the Clinton administration [too].\u201d He recalled\u00a0that he took a stand against the Iran deal, \u201cmuch to the umbrage of my old boss,\u201d President Barack Obama.\n\nIn sum, he said, \u201cone thing we will never do, is we will never tolerate intolerance. Period. And to those who think that\u2019s political, so be it.\u201d\n\nBerrin referred to recent comments by\u00a0Rabbi Sharon Brous, who had\u00a0declared \u201cthe world has gone mad,\u201d and had referred to Steve Bannon as an\u00a0\u201can alt-right, white supremacist purveyor of racist, Islamophobic, and antisemitic propaganda as chief strategist to the White House.\u201d Berrin asked: \u201cSo my question to the panel is, do you know of anything Steve Bannon has said that was antisemitic? And if not, does his long association with people like Andrew Breitbart and others, strongly identified Jew, suggest another dynamic is at work?\u201d\n\nGreenblatt said, \u201cI\u2019ll jump in and simply said that I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in \u2014 I don\u2019t think any of us know what\u2019s in Steve Bannon\u2019s heart. We don\u2019t really know what his motives are. But we do know that as executive chairman of that media company, he identified a market center and felt that his website Breitbart could serve it. He was very explicit.\u201d\n\nParaphrasing Bannon, Greenblatt said, \u201che said, we will make this the platform for the alt-right. And I will repeat what I said about the alt-right. This is white supremacy 2016. Racism, antisemitism, etc. We saw that.\u201d (Greenblatt backed down from claims that Breitbart News is the \u201cpremier\u201d alt-right site last month.)\n\n\nMany have told me he\u2019s got Jewish employees. Many have reminded me he opened up a Jerusalem office. That all may be well and good, but we have crunched the numbers. We have looked at the data. And anyone who tells you that the alt-right is not a problem is wrong. So, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in Steve Bannon\u2019s head. And I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in his heart. I can\u2019t speak to what his intentions are. All we can do is focus on the outcomes.\n\n\nLater in the debate, Greenblatt went on to say, \u201cKarl Marx was Jewish, right? People say that Vladimir Lenin, who led a lot of stuff, was Jewish. Research has found that Hitler had a Jewish grandmother. I\u2019m not comparing the president-elect to any of those historical figures, but I simply was trying to point out that\u00a0those who say he doesn\u2019t understand us\u2026 are wrong. He does. That doesn\u2019t give him a get out of jail free card. It doesn\u2019t. But we should acknowledge that it\u2019s complicated.\u201d\n\nFollow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter\u00a0@AdelleNaz", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.908173561096191, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 858, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.56405913946, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 12, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161215200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.3986013986013999, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.09090909091}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/news/a-look-at-notable-state-supreme-court-races-in-2016/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "A look at notable state supreme court races in 2016", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1176, "date": "20161101170000", "story_content": "At least half a dozen states have high-profile elections for their state supreme courts this year, and partisan groups are spending hundreds of thousands of dollar to influence the races. A look at some of the more notable court elections this year:\n\n___\n\nIOWA\n\nThree Iowa Supreme Court justices are facing voters for the first time since they joined their colleagues in unanimously ruling to legalize gay marriage seven years ago.\n\nThe ruling drew the ire of Christian conservatives, who spent $1 million to oust three of the court\u2019s members in 2010. Those justices are the only ones removed from the bench by voters since the adoption of a retention election system in 1962.\n\nThis time around, with gay marriage legalized nationally by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2015, no aggressive campaign has targeted Chief Justice Mark Cady or Justices Daryl Hecht and Brent Appel. They need a simple majority to remain on the bench.\n\nThe three have refused to campaign for their jobs because they believe the court should be above politics.\n\n___\n\nKANSAS\n\nNo justice has been voted out of office since Kansas adopted retention elections for its state Supreme Court in 1960. This year could test that, with five justices facing yes-or-no questions about whether they should remain on the court.\n\nConservatives are trying to remove four: Justices Carol Beier and Dan Biles, who were appointed by former Democratic Gov. Kathleen Sebelius; and Justice Marla Luckert and Chief Justice Lawton Nuss, who were appointed by former Gov. Bill Graves, a moderate Republican.\n\nThe fifth, Justice Caleb Stegall, is a 2014 appointee of conservative GOP Gov. Sam Brownback and has not been targeted.\n\nThe court\u2019s critics have objected to its rulings in capital punishment cases, including a decision overturning the death penalty for two brothers convicted of murdering four people in 2000 in Wichita. Independent advertising criticizing the justices has focused on that case, with a group called Kansans for Justice spending $276,000 on television ads, according to the nonprofit Center for Public Integrity.\n\nBut the court also has other important business before it, including an education-funding lawsuit filed in 2010 and a lawsuit challenging a 2015 ban on the most common second-trimester abortion procedure.\n\nAnother group, Kansans for Fair Courts, is spearheading the campaign to keep all five justices in office. It has support from four former governors from both parties and has run nearly $223,000 in television ads across the state since mid-October.\n\n___\n\nLOUISIANA\n\nIn Louisiana, justices of the seven-member Supreme Court are elected to 10-year terms. One incumbent is running unopposed, while two candidates are running for an open seat from southwestern Louisiana.\n\nAs of late last month, Marilyn Castle, a state district court judge in Lafayette, had raised more than $500,000 compared with more than $1 million raised by her opponent, James Genovese, a state appeals court judge. In addition, the race has drawn some $785,000 in outside TV spending, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School.\n\nBoth candidates are Republicans, but Castle is the favorite of the state\u2019s business lobbyists and the oil and gas industry, which is concerned about expensive \u201clegacy lawsuits\u201d that seek money to repair environmental damage.\n\nA group called the Center for Individual Freedom, which does not disclose its donors, has spent nearly $500,000 on Castle\u2019s behalf. Its ads have accused Genovese of siding with sexual predators. Another group attacking Genovese, Citizens for Judicial Excellence, is backed by a prominent charter schools supporter. A lawsuit challenging public funding of charter schools is making its way through the courts.\n\n___\n\nNORTH CAROLINA\n\nJustices registered as Republicans hold a 4-3 edge on North Carolina\u2019s officially nonpartisan Supreme Court. That power balance would tip in the Democrats\u2019 favor for the first time since 1998 if Superior Court Judge Mike Morgan succeeds in his bid to unseat two-term Republican Justice Bob Edmunds.\n\nIn the past two years, the court\u2019s Republican majority has upheld the use of taxpayer money for student scholarships at private schools, as well as the redrawing of congressional and legislative districts in a manner that federal appeals courts later struck down as racial gerrymandering.\n\nThe campaign has drawn heavy outside spending, including more than $905,000 from North Carolina Families First, a liberal group running ads critical of Edmunds. One ad says Edmunds supported \u201chis party\u2019s discrimination\u201d by writing the 2014 opinion upholding a district drawn \u201cto segregate African-American voters.\u201d\n\nThe business-friendly North Carolina Chamber is running a largely biographical TV ad supporting Edmunds. The group is bankrolled by a $1 million contribution from a legal reform arm of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\n___\n\nOHIO\n\nIn a race for an open high court seat, Cincinnati appeals court judge Pat DeWine, a Republican, has booked almost $644,000 in TV ads, according to an analysis by the Brennan Center. DeWine\u2019s opponent, Warren Democratic appeals court judge Cynthia Rice, released her first TV ad Monday, but no spending figure was immediately available.\n\nDemocrats say DeWine will face a monumental conflict of interest if elected because his father is Attorney General Mike DeWine. DeWine says he has been assured through legal opinions that he would have to step aside only if his father personally argued a case.\n\nIn its annual ratings of judicial candidates, the Ohio State Bar Association rated Rice as highly recommended and DeWine as not recommended. The association does not explain its ratings.\n\nIn a second contested race, Democratic Judge John P. O\u2019Donnell, a Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court judge, is running against Cincinnati appeals court judge Pat Fischer.\n\n___\n\nWASHINGTON\n\nChief Justice Barbara Madsen faces a challenge from Kittitas County Prosecutor Greg Zempel, and Justice Mary Yu is defending her seat against retired Gonzaga University law professor David DeWolf. But the most expensive matchup is between first-term Justice Charlie Wiggins and Dave Larson, a municipal court judge in the Seattle suburb of Federal Way.\n\nOutside groups backed by billionaires have dumped $900,000 into the race on Larson\u2019s behalf in the final weeks of the campaign, swamping the $236,000 Wiggins has raised this year. Larson also has backing from the Republican Party.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving the money? Wiggins, who supported Democratic gubernatorial candidates in his prior career as an appellate lawyer, joined court majorities in striking down a state law that allowed public funding of charter schools and a voter-approved anti-tax measure. He also supported the decision to hold the state in contempt and fine it $100,000 per day for failing to pay enough for public schools.\n\nLarson says such rulings have improperly imposed political pressure on the Legislature, making it more difficult to solve tough problems.\n\nEven though Wiggins has a stronger rating from the state prosecutors association than Larson, the advertising against Wiggins has painted him as soft on crime, citing one ruling on police searches and mischaracterizing another about whether criminal defendants who post bond can have guns. A group that included retired state Supreme Court Chief Justice Gerry Alexander and former Seattle U.S. Attorney John McKay called the ads improper and dishonest.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 15, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.165700078010559, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1130, "FairnessVirtue": 14, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.201716182149999, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 46, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161101170000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 4.18181818182, "FairnessVice": 1, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 4.07079646017699, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/11/21/erdogan-says-refugee-crisis-gulen-extradition-impasse-leave-disillusioned-obama/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [152]}}, "headline": "Erdogan \u2018Disillusioned\u2019 with Obama for Not Taking Migrant Crisis \u2018Seriously\u2019", "wordcount_as_scraped": 696, "date": "20161122080000", "story_content": "Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sat for an interview with CBS News's\u00a060 Minutes on Sunday, and he pronounced himself \"disillusioned\" with the Obama administration's failure to deal with the Syrian refugee crisis \"seriously\" or extradite cleric Fethullah Gulen.\n\n\"We have addressed these issues, discussed them with President Obama and Vice President Biden. They failed to rise to the occasion and handle these issues seriously. This is quite upsetting for us,\" Erdogan told interviewer Steve Kroft, referring to the security threat created by the Syrian civil war and the millions of refugees pouring into Turkey.\n\n\n\n\"You seem very frustrated with the United States,\" Kroft suggested.\n\n\"Well, let me be very frank in my remarks and I've been known for my candor. I wouldn't speak the truth if I said I was not disillusioned. Because I am disillusioned,\" Erdogan replied.\n\nAs for Gulen, Erdogan said he was \"the leader of a terrorist organization that has bombed my parliament.\"\n\n\"We have extradited terrorists to the United States in the past. And we expect the same thing to be done by the United States,\" Erdogan declared.\n\nHe stopped short of endorsing conspiracy theories popular with his supporters about U.S. support for the coup attempt in July, but as Kroft noted, he was not exactly working hard to discourage the Turkish people from believing in such theories.\n\n\"I'm not going to blame the United States. But that's what my people will think. Why are you still keeping that man? So as long you harbor him there, I'm sorry, don't get offended. But this is the perception of the Turkish nation and the Turkish people,\" said Erdogan.\n\nThe Turkish president defended his crackdown on suspected coup supporters and the Gulenist movement, which has led to some 30,000 detentions and 100,000 firings or suspensions to date. Some critics think Erdogan's government has used the coup as an excuse to crush Gulen's followers, while others \u2014 including academic Soli Ozel, quoted during the 60 Minutes segment \u2014 say it is more like Erdogan is using the Gulenist conspiracy as a pretext for crushing everyone else he finds inconvenient to his authoritarian goals.\n\n\"In Turkey, they attempted to destroy my state. And of course, we could not remain silent. We could not remain indifferent. And these measures are being taken by prosecutors and judges in full accordance with the rule of law,\" Erdogan insisted. \"We have saved our country from the hands of a heinous coup. And we are very much determined to protect our democracy.\"\n\nHe also addressed criticism about the Turkish government's clash with the Kurds, a conflict that has spread for battles with Kurdish separatists inside Turkey to include Kurdish forces that have been indispensable allies of the U.S. and Europe against the Islamic State.\n\n\"You cannot defend another terrorist organization just because they are fighting ISIS as well. You cannot make a distinction between a good terrorist organization and a bad terrorist organization,\" Erdogan argued. \n\nThe incoming Trump administration is seen as friendlier to Turkish interests than Obama was, particularly on the question of Gulen's extradition, given that Trump's chosen national security adviser, retired Lt. General Michael Flynn, has called for a swifter response to Turkey's request. The Turkish embassy was pleased by Flynn's comments \u2014 Gulen's lawyers, much less so.\n\nWriting for Bloomberg View, Eli Like suggests Trump is already wheeling and dealing with Erdogan by floating the idea of a speedy Gulen extradition, a strategy that supporters hope will use the tremendous significance Erdogan's government has placed upon Gulen as leverage against them, moving Turkey more firmly into the United States's orbit as an ally against ISIS and Syria. In essence, Erdogan has maneuvered himself into a position where he can't refuse a very hard Trump bargain for handing Gulen over.\n\nCritics charge that even if successful, such a gambit would cost the U.S. its relationship with the Kurds, and that would be a bitter pill for stalwart battlefield allies against ISIS to swallow. Erdogan's 60 Minutes interview conveyed the impression that he currently sees no reason to change either his tactics or his goals. Bitter pills may be the only effective medication available to the next administration's Middle Eastern strategists.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.8770053386688197, "HarmVice": 5, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 686, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.6566616720400003, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161122080000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 4.5189504373177805, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/12/07/youtube-generates-over-1-billion-in-ad-revenue-for-the-music-industry/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [351, 2116, 2268, 2328, 3798, 4662, 4826, 4830, 4865, 4876, 4890, 4893]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 739, "scraper_regex": 798}}, "headline": "YouTube Generates over $1 Billion in Ad Revenue for the Music Industry in 2016", "wordcount_as_scraped": 798, "date": "20161207220000", "story_content": "YouTube has generated more than $1 billion in advertisement revenue to the music industry this year, according to a statement from the company.\n\nThe figure was released to the public in an official YouTube blog post titled \u201cA Billion Reasons to Celebrate Music on YouTube.\u201d\u00a0The company also added that \u201cthis is just the beginning,\u201d with the ad revenue figure predicted to rise over the next few years.\n\n\u201cLast year was a bright one for music\u2014after several tough years of declining revenues, the industry started growing again, spurred in large part by the growth of music streaming subscriptions,\u201d wrote YouTube in their blog post. \u201cThis year, the industry has even more reasons to be optimistic. Even as music subscriptions have been growing faster than any other subscription type, advertising is another powerful driver of revenue. In fact, in the last 12 months, YouTube has paid out over $1 billion to the music industry from advertising alone, demonstrating that multiple experiences and models are succeeding alongside each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd this is just the beginning,\u201d the company continued. \u201cAs more advertising dollars shift from TV, radio and print to online services, the music industry will generate even more revenue from ads. In the future, the music business has an opportunity to look a lot like television, where subscriptions and advertising contribute roughly equal amounts of revenue, bolstered by digital and physical sales.\u201d\n\nThe company also admitted, however, \u201cTo achieve this, there is a lot of work that must be done by YouTube and the industry as a whole,\u201d adding, \u201cbut we are excited to see the momentum.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt a time when there's never been more competition for attention, fans can't get enough good music,\u201d YouTube concluded. \u201cIt is clear that this creative industry has two strong engines of growth \u2014 subscriptions and advertising \u2014 and we are honored to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, several musical artists criticized YouTube for their advertising model, with Irving Azoff declaring in an open letter\u00a0that Google has built a system that works for them but \u201cdoesn't work well for artists.\u201d\n\nYouTube attempted to defend themselves against artist backlash\u00a0in an April blog post titled \u201cSetting the Record Straight,\u201d\u00a0where the company claimed it was \u201csurprising\u201d to see artists unhappy with the platform.\n\n\u201cFirst, let's start with where we agree. Music matters. Musicians and songwriters matter. They deserve to be compensated fairly. We believe this deeply and have partnered with the music industry for years to ensure it happens on our platform,\u201d wrote YouTube in their blog post. \u201cThat's why it's surprising to see those same labels and artists suggest that YouTube has allowed a flood of \u2018unlicensed\u2019 music onto its platform, depriving artists of revenue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth is that YouTube takes copyright management extremely seriously and we work to ensure rightsholders make money no matter who uploads their music,\u201d they continued. \u201cNo other platform gives as much money back to creators\u2013 big and small\u2013 across all kinds of content.\u201d\n\nAzoff, however, did not appreciate YouTube\u2019s response, claiming it \u201cdid exactly the opposite\u201d of what they intended to do:\n\nDear YouTube,\nYour attempt at \u201cSetting the Record Straight\u201d through a post on your \u201ccreator blog\u201d last month did exactly the opposite: It was obfuscation to divert artists' attention from the fact that YouTube hides behind the DMCA's \u201csafe harbor\u201d provision and pays artists a pittance.\nYou say that music matters to YouTube. There is an old adage about actions and words. If YouTube valued music, then it would allow artists to have the same control which YouTube grants to itself.YouTube has created original programming.\u00a0Those programs sit behind a \u201cpaid wall\u201d and are not accessible for free unless YouTube decides to make them available that way. If a fan wants to watch the YouTube series \u201cSister-Zoned,\u201d that fan has to subscribe to YouTube Red for $9.99 a month. But the same does not apply to music.\nWhen the artist sends a \u201ctake down,\u201d it should be a \u201cstay down.\u201d\nIf music matters to YouTube, then why not give musicians the same choice you give yourselves? Taylor Swift should be able to decide which of her songs are available for free and which are part of a paid subscription service. Or she should be able to opt out of YouTube if you won't give her this choice.\n\nKaty Perry, Maroon 5, Bette Midler, and Elvis Costello also criticized YouTube in an open letter earlier this year.\n\nIn October, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki claimed that YouTube was \u201cstill in investment mode,\u201d\u00a0hinting that the company might not be profitable yet.\n\n\"There's no timetable,\" she continued on the topic of a profitability timetable.\n\nCharlie Nash is a reporter\u00a0for\u00a0Breitbart Tech.

Among its notable attacks was a bombing at Fraunces Tavern in New York in 1975 that killed four people.\n\nThe group was known for its tight-knit membership, fanatical zeal and hit-and-run tactics, as exemplified by the bombings of four government buildings in Manhattan and Brooklyn on New Year's Eve in 1982 that seriously wounded three police officers.\n\nMr. Lopez Rivera was not specifically charged in the Fraunces Tavern bombing but more broadly with, among other things, the interstate transportation of firearms with the intent to commit violent crimes, and transportation of explosives with intent to kill and injure people and to destroy government buildings and property.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2002, Obama served alongside Ayers as a paid director of the Chicago nonprofit the Woods Fund.\n\nObama also worked closely with Ayers in 1995 at the Chicago Annenberg Challenge education group, according to the CAC's archived records.\n\nI previously reported:\n\nThe records also show Obama's and Ayers' foundation granted money to radical leftist activist causes.\n\nNews reports, archived records, interviews and Ayers' own curriculum vitae document that Ayers was a founder of the CAC, which billed itself as a school-reform organization. Ayers also served as co-chairman of the Chicago School Reform Collaborative, one of the two operational arms of the CAC, from its formation in 1995 until 2000.\n\nAyers made presentations to board meetings chaired by Obama. Ayers also spoke for the Chicago School Reform Collaborative before Obama's board, while Obama periodically spoke for the board at meetings of the collaborative, according to CAC documents.\n\nAccording to the documents, first reviewed by National Review Online writer Stanley Kurtz, the CAC granted money to far-left causes, such as the now-defunct Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN.\n\n\"Everything was absolutely ideal on the day I bombed the Pentagon,\" Ayers wrote in his memoirs, Fugitive Days. \u00a0He added a disclaimer that he didn't personally plant the explosives.\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

He also falsely claimed that Trump was preventing Muslims from entering the country. In actuality, Trump's executive order halts visas for 90 days for \"immigrants and non-immigrants\" from Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Yemen, Iran, and Iraq. The order further suspended the entry of all refugees for 120 days, indefinitely blocked Syrian refugees from entering and lowered the ceiling to 50,000 for refugees allowed to enter the U.S. during Fiscal Year 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, Telegram user Omra Alfarouq, another IS supporter, wrote: \u201cThe decisions made by that fool (Trump) will drag America and its supporters into a war against each other that will be sparked by the mujahedeen, who will take advantage of it to settle in.\"\n\n\n\nUtilizing racist language, Alfarouq continued, \"The confrontations with the blacks that started under the donkey Obama will repeat itself, but this time in a much broader way among the Americans.

The halt was the result of the discovery of two al-Qaida members admitted as refugees from Iraq who were living in Bowling Green, Kentucky and who had admitted to targeting U.S. troops in Iraq.\u00a0 The network at the time also cited FBI agents conceding that \"several dozen suspected terrorist bombmakers, including some believed to have targeted American troops, may have mistakenly been allowed to move to the United States as war refugees.\"\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

Trump, and at that moment laid out the case for why I knew he was the voice America was waiting for.\n\nI received much ridicule, even from friends. As the weeks progressed, I continued to write not only here but in other places like Newsmax and the Orange County Register, but mostly at my home here, given to me by Andrew Breitbart himself. Through the ensuing primaries I was steadfast for the Donald, as you can see from my articles or appearances on Neil Cavuto, Lou Dobbs, Chris Matthews or other shows on Fox Business. I expressed my point of view with a deep understanding of the message and power Mr. Trump held as the voice for those forgotten, ignored citizens who inherently knew our Nation was infected by elites and globalists.\n\nI had many conversations with folks in and out of politics and even known celebrities who asked me why I was such an intense supporter. With every bump in the road, with every controversy which sent many to the mats in their support for DJT, I remained steadfast and articulated my reasons for doing so. This passion never wavered, not once, especially once we hit the general election face-off between Trump and Hillary Clinton. America First was the battle cry we had not heard from our politicians in many years. Now, finally, a voice was speaking not only for all of us but for the nation that we love.\n\nThe election is now behind us and the real work begins. We have the future of our nation to attend to, which brings me to the reason for writing this article. With the historic and monumental accomplishment we just witnessed by President-elect Donald J. Trump, I would like to look back to one of our greatest presidents, Ronald Reagan. What I am about to refer to has about as much to do with our national security as any other issue.\n\nIn his farewell speech after the astounding success of his eight years as our President, Ronald Reagan left the most important warning to the nation for his last words. I cannot stress enough; this final prophetic warning by President Reagan is so prescient it begs the question of whether or not Reagan could see into the future. Interestingly, this same kind of prescience is in Donald Trump.\n\nPresident Reagan mentioned that what he was most proud of in his presidency was the renaissance of national pride that he called \u201cthe new patriotism.\u201d\n\nReagan said:\n\n\u201cFinally, there is a great tradition of warnings in Presidential farewells, and I\u2019ve got one that\u2019s been on my mind for some time.\nBut oddly enough it starts with one of the things I\u2019m proudest of in the past eight years; the resurgence of national pride that I called \u201cthe new patriotism.\u201d This national feeling is good, but it won\u2019t count for much, and it won\u2019t last unless it\u2019s grounded in thoughtfulness and knowledge.\nAn informed patriotism is what we want. And are we doing a good enough job teaching our children what America is and what she represents in the long history of the world?\nThose of us who are over 35 or so years of age grew up in a different America. We were taught, very directly, what it means to be an American, and we absorbed almost in the air a love of country and an appreciation of its institutions. If you didn\u2019t get these things from your family you got them from the neighborhood, from the father down the street who fought in Korea or the family who lost someone at Anzio. Or you could get a sense of patriotism from school. And if all else failed, you could get a sense of patriotism from the popular culture. The movies celebrated democratic values and implicitly reinforced the idea that America was special. TV was like that, too, through the mid-Sixties.\u201d\n\nAN INFORMED PATRIOTISM! My dear fellow Americans, this is a NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE! Not many people bring this up, and this was Ronald Reagan\u2019s most important warning!\n\nEducation and Culture in America has been besieged by an American Amnesia. Our youth has been indoctrinated and deliberately confused. Our massive problem with immigration has given us the largest number of unassimilated immigrants in the history of our nation. Instead of teaching American History, what is now taught is the Bill Ayers-inspired communist Marxist progressive multi-cultural battle cry that America is a nation that should be gutted and have its heart ripped out and replaced by a socialist moral relativism that has nothing to do with National Pride but instead worships at the feet of the Globalists. Today\u2019s films, television and music further split us apart under the guise of leading us toward an enlightened civilization, while in fact it is all about an agenda that erases God and Country from our discourse and replaces them with a teardown of the American experience, erases institutions and replaces them with a pre-Judeo-Christian pantheism.\n\nTake the current rioters: while some are subversive anarchists, bought and paid for by George Soros, there are others who are absolutely sincere in their protest. But those sincere souls I believe are protesting because of a failure, or should I say deliberate attempt, by left-wing educators to not fairly teach but to propagandize and preach to students. I wrote about this danger several years ago. The question is: knowing schools across America are failing, knowing that textbooks are being rewritten to purposely lobotomize our history, is anyone surprised that we have such a divisive nation? An uninformed, indoctrinated youth and immigrant population is how the Progressive Communist left and the GOP elites gerrymander elections.\n\nThis is the crisis Ronald Reagan understood was the danger facing America. With the election of the only candidate in 40 years who has understood and communicated what Ronald Reagan warned against and what We the People are feeling but unable to articulate, we have a responsibility and an unprecedented opportunity to ensure that we implement in our schools a mandate in American History and Civics that protects not only an understanding of the Constitution but the very survival of an America our Founders set forth. I call for a \u201cNew American Patriotism,\u201d and we have just the person to lead the charge: President Donald J. Trump.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 26, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.8189262747764591, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 999, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 7.15818897637, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 26, "mft_sum": 42, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161114220000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.8181818181800002, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 4, "pct_mft_words": 4.2042042042042, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/11/01/former-yale-professor-campus-coddling-culture-harms-students/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [311, 1042, 1074, 3428]}}, "headline": "Former Yale Professor: Campus Coddling Culture Damages Students", "wordcount_as_scraped": 516, "date": "20161102190000", "story_content": "Former Yale Professor Erika Christakis, whose email about Halloween costumes last year incited significant campus tension, declared in an editorial on Monday that campus coddling culture actually harms those that it intends to protect.\n\nChristakis,\u00a0an early childhood educator, resigned from his position at Yale after the community revolted against an email she wrote in which she argued that students should be able to choose their own Halloween costumes, free from the administration\u2019s involvement. The email was written in response to a growing concern in the Yale community that students would choose to wear racially or culturally offensive costumes on Halloween.\n\nIn a now infamous video, Christakis\u2019 husband Nicholas, then master of Yale\u2019s Silliman residential college, was confronted by then senior Jerelyn Luther who told him that it was his responsibility to protect the students who resided within the community before calling him \u201cdisgusting.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn an editorial for\u00a0The Washington Post, Christakis\u00a0argues that Yale\u2019s culture of protection actually harms those that it intends to protect.

The Yale imbroglio became a merciless punchline, leaving no one unscathed, because the lack of a candid internal reckoning emboldened partisan outsiders to hijack the story.

It's never easy to foster dialogue about race, class, gender and culture, but it will only become more difficult for faculty in disciplines concerned with the human condition if universities won't declare that ideas and feelings aren't interchangeable. \u2026\nBy affirming only the narrow right to air my views, rather than helping the community to grapple with its intense response, an unfortunate message was made plain: Certain ideas are too dangerous to be heard at Yale.\nvar _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([\"embed\"]);The collective denial of responsibility risks shortchanging students' intellectual maturation and gradual assumption of autonomy.

The currency is currently at an eight-year-low in value, the news outlet adds.\n\n\"China has been consciously cutting its holdings of U.S. Treasuries, to defend the yuan, and it's hard to stop this trend,\" Zhou Hao, Singapore-based economist with Commerzbank, told Reuters, noting that he expects China to keep selling off its holdings, even if that means giving Japan more control over American debt.\n\nThe October numbers were released Thursday and do not reflect what Chinese investors chose to do following the election of Donald Trump, a consistent critic of the Chinese government, to the American presidency. Japan\u2019s Kyodo News notes, however, that Chinese government data \u201cshowed the country's foreign exchange reserves shrank [by] $69.1 billion in November from October to $3.0515 trillion, suggesting that Beijing may have further cut its U.S. bond holdings.\u201d The numbers released this week come from the U.S. Treasury Department.\n\nAmerica\u2019s current national debt stands at $19.8 trillion. Other major creditors include Ireland, the Cayman Islands, and Brazil.\n\nPerhaps anticipating that investors would read bad economic news for China from its sales of U.S. debt, the Chinese state-run\u00a0People\u2019s Daily ran a column this week arguing that the United States has a serious debt problem that threatens the development of the entire globe, and predicting that President-elect Trump would increase the national debt by another $10 trillion, \u201cput[ting] the U.S. government under huge financial pressure.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s CCTV, state-run but often behaving more as a common news outlet than a government mouthpiece, published a piece, instead highlighting the reasons to be hopeful for a President-elect Trump, including \u201cTrump's pledge in the initial days of the presidency to pull out of the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership)\u201d and the fact that Trump \u201cvalue[s] the importance of a strong business acumen.\u201d\n\nWhile the U.S. national debt is a great risk to the American economy, China\u2019s own debt\u00a0is arguably a greater threat to the communist nation\u2019s economy. China\u2019s debt grew by $26 trillion this century, which the\u00a0National Interest notes is \u201cgreater than the GDP of the United States, Japan and Germany combined.\u201d\n\nThe publication adds that, except for Japan, China is the most indebted country in the world. As the Federal Reserve increases U.S. interest rates, it continues to challenge the value of the yuan, which forces China to increase its own national debt as it keeps yuan demand high by buying up the currency. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday and is expected to do so again shortly after the new year.\n\nEven in noting that China\u2019s refusal to lend the U.S. as much money as it consistently has may hurt the American economy, Reuters argues that \u201csuch a move would roil global markets and likely even rebound on China\u2019s own, making this, in some analysts\u2019 minds, a worst case scenario short of war.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.55555558204651, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 614, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 6, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.29788311768, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161216220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.90879478827362, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/12/07/youtube-generates-over-1-billion-in-ad-revenue-for-the-music-industry/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [351, 2116, 2268, 2328, 3798, 4662, 4826, 4830, 4865, 4876, 4890, 4893]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 739, "scraper_regex": 798}}, "headline": "YouTube Generates over $1 Billion in Ad Revenue for the Music Industry in 2016", "wordcount_as_scraped": 798, "date": "20161207220000", "story_content": "YouTube has generated more than $1 billion in advertisement revenue to the music industry this year, according to a statement from the company.\n\nThe figure was released to the public in an official YouTube blog post titled \u201cA Billion Reasons to Celebrate Music on YouTube.\u201d\u00a0The company also added that \u201cthis is just the beginning,\u201d with the ad revenue figure predicted to rise over the next few years.\n\n\u201cLast year was a bright one for music\u2014after several tough years of declining revenues, the industry started growing again, spurred in large part by the growth of music streaming subscriptions,\u201d wrote YouTube in their blog post. \u201cThis year, the industry has even more reasons to be optimistic. Even as music subscriptions have been growing faster than any other subscription type, advertising is another powerful driver of revenue. In fact, in the last 12 months, YouTube has paid out over $1 billion to the music industry from advertising alone, demonstrating that multiple experiences and models are succeeding alongside each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd this is just the beginning,\u201d the company continued. \u201cAs more advertising dollars shift from TV, radio and print to online services, the music industry will generate even more revenue from ads. In the future, the music business has an opportunity to look a lot like television, where subscriptions and advertising contribute roughly equal amounts of revenue, bolstered by digital and physical sales.\u201d\n\nThe company also admitted, however, \u201cTo achieve this, there is a lot of work that must be done by YouTube and the industry as a whole,\u201d adding, \u201cbut we are excited to see the momentum.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt a time when there's never been more competition for attention, fans can't get enough good music,\u201d YouTube concluded. \u201cIt is clear that this creative industry has two strong engines of growth \u2014 subscriptions and advertising \u2014 and we are honored to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, several musical artists criticized YouTube for their advertising model, with Irving Azoff declaring in an open letter\u00a0that Google has built a system that works for them but \u201cdoesn't work well for artists.\u201d\n\nYouTube attempted to defend themselves against artist backlash\u00a0in an April blog post titled \u201cSetting the Record Straight,\u201d\u00a0where the company claimed it was \u201csurprising\u201d to see artists unhappy with the platform.\n\n\u201cFirst, let's start with where we agree. Music matters. Musicians and songwriters matter. They deserve to be compensated fairly. We believe this deeply and have partnered with the music industry for years to ensure it happens on our platform,\u201d wrote YouTube in their blog post. \u201cThat's why it's surprising to see those same labels and artists suggest that YouTube has allowed a flood of \u2018unlicensed\u2019 music onto its platform, depriving artists of revenue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth is that YouTube takes copyright management extremely seriously and we work to ensure rightsholders make money no matter who uploads their music,\u201d they continued. \u201cNo other platform gives as much money back to creators\u2013 big and small\u2013 across all kinds of content.\u201d\n\nAzoff, however, did not appreciate YouTube\u2019s response, claiming it \u201cdid exactly the opposite\u201d of what they intended to do:\n\nDear YouTube,\nYour attempt at \u201cSetting the Record Straight\u201d through a post on your \u201ccreator blog\u201d last month did exactly the opposite: It was obfuscation to divert artists' attention from the fact that YouTube hides behind the DMCA's \u201csafe harbor\u201d provision and pays artists a pittance.\nYou say that music matters to YouTube. There is an old adage about actions and words. If YouTube valued music, then it would allow artists to have the same control which YouTube grants to itself.YouTube has created original programming.\u00a0Those programs sit behind a \u201cpaid wall\u201d and are not accessible for free unless YouTube decides to make them available that way. If a fan wants to watch the YouTube series \u201cSister-Zoned,\u201d that fan has to subscribe to YouTube Red for $9.99 a month. But the same does not apply to music.\nWhen the artist sends a \u201ctake down,\u201d it should be a \u201cstay down.\u201d\nIf music matters to YouTube, then why not give musicians the same choice you give yourselves? Taylor Swift should be able to decide which of her songs are available for free and which are part of a paid subscription service. Or she should be able to opt out of YouTube if you won't give her this choice.\n\nKaty Perry, Maroon 5, Bette Midler, and Elvis Costello also criticized YouTube in an open letter earlier this year.\n\nIn October, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki claimed that YouTube was \u201cstill in investment mode,\u201d\u00a0hinting that the company might not be profitable yet.\n\n\"There's no timetable,\" she continued on the topic of a profitability timetable.\n\nCharlie Nash is a reporter\u00a0for\u00a0Breitbart Tech.

That changed after the Million Man March in 1995, a gathering of black men meant to show renewed commitment to family and solidarity. The park service estimated 400,000 people attended the march, making it one of the largest demonstrations in history in Washington.\n\nBut organizers believed they reached their goal of 1 million participants. Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, one of the march organizers, threatened to sue the park service, arguing its count was motivated by \u201cracism, white supremacy and hatred for Louis Farrakhan.\u201d Researchers at Boston University did an independent analysis and said the crowd was much bigger, pegging it at more than 800,000.\n\nNo lawsuit was filed, but the dispute was enough to get the park service out of the head-counting business. The following year, Congress passed an appropriations bill that barred the agency from spending money to count crowds. While that language didn\u2019t appear in subsequent budgets, refusing to count crowds became park service policy.\n\nThe agency still estimates crowd size for its own planning purposes, but does not publicly reveal the figures.\n\n\u201cNo matter what we said or did, no one ever felt we gave a fair estimate,\u201d U.S. Park Police Maj. J.J. McLaughlin, who had been in charge of coordinating crowd estimates, said in 1996 when the agency confirmed it would no longer count heads.\n\n___\n\nHOW CROWDS ARE COUNTED\n\nBefore it stopped, the park service came up with its crowd figures by studying aerial photographs. Using a grid system, the park service would divide the Mall into sections of equal square footage. Then it counted the number of people in each section of the grid by looking at how tightly packed the crowd was and assigning a number of people per square foot.\n\nNot much has changed since about the way crowds are estimated, said Steve Doig, a journalism professor at Arizona State University who specializes in measuring crowd sizes.\n\nThe figure that corresponds to a \u201cloosely packed crowd,\u201d Doig said, is 10 square feet per person, \u201cwhich sounds like a lot but it\u2019s really not.\u201d That means people could reach out and touch those closest to them on all sides.\n\n\u201cA tighter crowd would get down to maybe 6 or 7 square feet per person,\u201d he said. \u201cA scary mosh pit crowd would be maybe 3 to 4 at most.\u201d\n\nCrowd estimates for events in Washington are difficult in general because the city\u2019s lack of tall buildings and security restrictions on aircraft make it tough to get comprehensive aerial images, Doig said.\n\nChristopher Geldart, the District of Columbia\u2019s homeland security director, has said consistently that he expects between 800,000 and 900,000 people to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration. He said he would use the tried-and-true grid method to provide his own crowd estimate on the Monday after the swearing-in.\n\n___\n\nWOMEN\u2019S MARCH\n\nThe largest-ever demonstration in Washington, according to park service figures, was an anti-Vietnam War protest in 1969 that drew 600,000 people. The Mall can easily accommodate crowds in the hundreds of thousands; between 300,000 and 400,000 regularly attend the July Fourth fireworks.\n\nOrganizers of Saturday\u2019s Women\u2019s March on Washington have received a permit from D.C. police for a gathering of 200,000 people. Geldart said he expects the number of participants to exceed that figure, based on data including bus, hotel and train bookings. He cautioned, however, that organizers have not yet told authorities to expect more than the permitted total.\n\n___\n\nPAST INAUGURATIONS\n\nThe park service did not dispute a widely reported estimate that 1.8 million people came to Washington for President Barack Obama\u2019s first inauguration in 2009, believed to be the largest inaugural crowd in history. The biggest crowd the park service counted at an inauguration was 1.2 million for Lyndon Johnson\u2019s 1965 swearing-in.\n\nDoig isn\u2019t sure about either of those figures. His analysis of aerial photographs led him to conclude that just 800,000 were on the Mall for Obama\u2019s first inauguration, though he did not include the parade route, where thousands more people waited all day to catch a glimpse of America\u2019s first black president.\n\nThe estimate was difficult because the density of the crowd varied widely, he said, despite aerial photographs that appeared to show the Mall full of people between the Capitol and the Washington Monument. Further away from the Capitol, people huddled around television monitors, leaving big tracts of mostly empty space.\n\nAny time a crowd reaches into the hundreds of thousands, it\u2019s a noteworthy gathering, Doig said, but boosters will always try to politicize the turnout for their chosen cause.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that aggravates me \u2026 is the need for it to be huge,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sort of drives the numbers into areas where it just clearly is fiction and it undercuts the reality of what really is an amazing crowd.\u201d\n\nTrump clearly cares about posting a big number.\n\nIn a video ad posted on social media Wednesday, he said: \u201cHopefully we\u2019re going to get a million people. We\u2019re going to really make a big statement.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Ben Nuckols on Twitter at https://twitter.com/APBenNuckols", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 14, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.02880656719208, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 891, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.91014784866, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170119140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.80583613916947, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/jerusalem/2017/01/13/unprecedented-work-auschwitz-preserve-holocaust-site/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 644, "scraper_regex": 686}}, "headline": "Unprecedented Work at Auschwitz to Preserve Holocaust Site", "wordcount_as_scraped": 686, "date": "20170113090000", "story_content": "OSWIECIM (POLAND) (AFP) \u2013 Brick by brick, plank by plank, workers at the former Nazi German death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau carefully clean its barracks to preserve the Holocaust symbol for future generations.\n\n\u201cThis is the largest preservation project in the history of the museum at Auschwitz-Birkenau.

The wooden frame is rotting. The foundations have been eroded by groundwater.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle they\u2019re still standing,\u201d says Jancia.\n\nIn total, 45 brick buildings at Birkenau will undergo restoration work.\n\nThe team will preserve whatever parts are in good condition, and replace those that are in a poor state or threaten the integrity of the entire building.\n\n\u201cWhatever we replace has to be visible to the eye, so as not to be confused with the original,\u201d Cyrulik says while pointing to layers of paint in a slightly different colour.\n\n\u2013 Model wall \u2013\n\nKneeling in a cramped hole, workers carefully remove earth to get at the foundations that have been weakened by groundwater.\n\nThey work by hand, without recourse to machines, as is the case elsewhere on-site.\n\nInside a nearby tent, they have built a six-metre-long model wall that is propped up by metal bars.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wall we built using the same materials and featuring the same flaws as those in the actual barracks,\u201d Jancia says.\n\n\u201cIt lets us test preservation methods. The walls are held up by the very same car jacks used for changing a tyre.\u201d\n\nThe entire project has so far cost 12 million zlotys (2.7 million euros, $2.9 million) in funding secured by the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation.\n\nCreated in 2009, it manages the funds meant to preserve the site of the former Nazi German camp.\n\nTo date, donors have contributed 101 million euros, including 60 million from Germany, as well as big donations from the United States, Poland, France and Austria.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.428571432828903, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 644, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.80495429464, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 8, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170113090000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.03726708074534, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/12/10/10-dec-16-world-view-eu-agrees-grant-visa-free-travel-people-ukraine-georgia/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 878, "scraper_regex": 956}}, "headline": "World View: EU Agrees to Grant Visa-Free Travel to People of Ukraine and Georgia", "wordcount_as_scraped": 956, "date": "20161210180000", "story_content": "This morning\u2019s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com\n\nUkraine still on track to host Eurovision song contest in 2017\n\n\nJamala, after winning the 2016 Eurovision Song Contest (DPA)\n\nThe European Broadcasting Union (EBU) announced on Thursday announced, \u201cContrary to media reports, we can confirm there are no plans to move the 2017 Eurovision Song Contest to Moscow.\u201d\n\nUkraine won the 2016 Eurovision contest in May, and according to rules, will be the host of the 2017 contest. However, Russia is objecting that Ukraine is too financially strapped to be able to host the multinational spectacle. Russia is also objecting that Ukraine is threatening to forbid attendance by anyone who supported Russia\u2019s invasion and annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea peninsula.\n\nThe core of the dispute is that the Ukraine singer Jamala (actual name Susana Jamaladinova) won the contest in May with an extremely emotional song called \u201c1944\u201d that appeared to allude to Russia\u2019s 1944 deportation of 240,000 ethnic Tatars from Crimea to Siberia and Central Asia. Jamala herself is an ethnic Tatar, whose great-grandmother was deported, along with five children.\n\nThursday\u2019s announcement by the EBU is intended to reassure the public that the issues have been resolved, and that the 2017 contest will be held in Ukraine.

The two sides are just fighting because of the political benefits that they gain as long as the war continues.\n\nIn 2014, Russia invaded Ukraine, with troops and equipment to support separatists who wanted to break off the entire eastern portion of Ukraine and annex it to Russia. That hasn\u2019t happened, but Russia also invaded Ukraine\u2019s Crimea peninsula and annexed it made it part of the Russian federation.\n\nHowever, the war in eastern Ukraine between the Ukrainian army, supported by the government in Kiev, and the Russian separatists, supported by Russian troops and equipment. The following interview excerpts occurred on RFI (my transcription):\n\nI don\u2019t see very many signs of things changing in any major way in the near future in the east. It\u2019s important to stress this war is very much ongoing. People are being killed everyday pretty much.\nIt pales in comparison to what\u2019s going on in Syria \u2013 the death toll is far far lower, thankfully, and civilians are bearing less of the brunt of it than they were in 2014-15. The casualties tend to be military casualties on both sides.\nAnd there\u2019s no clear sign of what people are trying to do. There\u2019s no evident attempt to take more territory by either side. It seems like, in a lot of ways, and I think there\u2019s quite a lot of evidence for this, they are mostly just carrying on fighting in order to carry on fighting.\nThe separatists need an excuse as to why life in the areas they control is so bad \u2013 why they aren\u2019t managing to build these pseudo states properly, and the easy thing to do is to blame the Ukrainians \u201cwho keep bombing us.\u201d\nThe Ukrainians find the war \u2014 this is perhaps a cynical analysis \u2014 but I think that there is an extent to which it\u2019s true \u2014 the Ukrainians \u2014 although and I would always stress that they did not start this war \u2014 but now there\u2019s a situation where the more it goes on, they don\u2019t have to face the impossible task of applying the Minsk peace agreement which was signed in February 2015, which is actually basically impossible for Ukraine to comply with. They could never get the vote in parliament needed to pass the measures that they promised Russia they would pass. So as long as the fighting goes on, they don\u2019t have to do that.\n\nRFI video\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEU agrees to grant visa-free travel to people of Ukraine and Georgia\n\nFrance 24 Ukraine correspondent Gulliver Cragg went on to say that what the Ukrainian government wants most of all from the EU is visa-free travel for Ukrainians throughout the Schengen zone. (This is the same issue as with Turkey, which wants visa-free travel for Turkish citizens throughout the Schengen zone.)\n\nIn fact, the European Parliament on Thursday reached an agreement to grant visa-free travel to the people of Ukraine and Georgia. Under the terms of the agreement, visa-free travel can be quickly terminated after an investigation following a request by an EU nation. The deal still needs to be officially approved by the entire European Parliament, which is expected next week.\n\nHowever, Cragg adds that visa-free travel won\u2019t be of much use to Ukrainians:\n\nThat\u2019s the one small piece of good news \u2014 that they\u2019re gonna get this visa-free travel, but it\u2019s not really gonna impact that many Ukrainians because they can\u2019t really afford to travel to Europe most of them. So there are those who will find it a bit easier to go to Europe and work illegally on short term temporary contracts, in Poland and Italy and things like that \u2013 that will make their lives a bit easier \u2014 but they\u2019re still gonna be working illegally, because this visa-free access doesn\u2019t allow them to work.\n\nIf approved, then Ukraine and Georgia will join the United States, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Israel, and Japan as countries having visa-free travel.

One of the organizations involved has specifically reported that Donald Trump supporters are legitimate \"targets\" for violence.\n\nThe J20 event was originally planned just after Donald Trump's election and is supported by a coalition of 75 different anarchist, socialist, and communist groups from across the county.\n\nThe organizers call the event \"a bold mobilization against the inauguration of Donald Trump\" and say its goal is \"widespread civil resistance to the streets of Washington, DC.\"\n\nOne member of the #DisruptJ20 coalition is the website It's Going Down, which acts an information resource for the America-hating radical left. Last spring, It's Going Down reported approvingly on the violent disruption of a Donald Trump event near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nBreitbart News has identified a number of Pittsburg area groups who have announced their solidarity with the #DisruptJ20 event, including the Pitt Students for a Democratic Society, Pittsburg Autonomous Student Network, the Pittsburgh Student Solidarity Coalition, Pitt Against Debt, the art group NightShade Pittsburgh.\n\nLast year's \"direct action\" against people attending a Donald Trump event gives a test of what the #DisruptJ20 protesters have in store for the Trump inauguration and Trump supporters.\n\nUSA Today reported on the violent consequences of the group's actions last year, writing:\n\nHundreds of demonstrators awaited Trump backers outside the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, dancing and shouting epithets about the presidential hopeful. At the height of the chaos, police shoved and Trump backers lingered for confrontations.\nA drum pounded, signs waved and megaphones blared near an exit for the rally, which drew thousands of attendees. Trump backers and protesters shouted at each other in some areas. In others, the demonstration had an almost jubilant flair, with protesters dancing as they chanted: \"Hey hey, ho ho, racist bigots have to go,\" or \"F Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe result was violence against people attending the Trump event and law enforcement, a foreboding sign for the upcoming D.C. events. TV Station WPXI reported about last spring's event:\n\nOfficers arrested 31-year-old Kennon Hooper, of West Oakland, 27-year-old Lisa Cuyler of Polish Hill and 29-year-old Maxwell Yearick of Perry South.\nPolice said Hooper kicked two officers after they had been pepper-sprayed by protesters. While he was being handcuffed, Cuyler allegedly jumped on an officer\u2019s back.\nIn Yearick's case, he tried to fight an officer who has just been pepper-sprayed, according to investigators.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported last year, It's Going Down bragged about the \"full disruption and confrontation\" of attendees and justified violence against them, reporting that:\n\nthe main factor tying Trump's base together is support for authoritarianism and white supremacy. The main policy points of Trump's campaign have been rooted in the widespread criminalization, detention, and expulsion of Muslims, Arabs, latin@s, blacks, and other non-whites from the United States.\nSupport of Donald Trump and by extension these aims is enough to justify oneself as a target of anti-racist violence.\n\nThe Trump event was not the only example of Pittsburg's far-left community using violent tactics and anarchy against those that they see as legitimate targets. Also last, the publication Three Rivers Rising Tide reported on another disruption by one of the group who've pledged support for the upcoming inauguration disruption, writing:\n\nTwo dozen Pittsburghers stormed into the American Legislative Exchange Council's (ALEC) Spring Task Force Summit meeting on Thursday evening, disrupting the lobbying group's Board of Directors Dinner. While ALEC's Summit is taking place at the Omni-William Penn, the dinner was held a few blocks away at Heinz Hall.\nHoisting yellow umbrellas with anti-ALEC slogans, a common prop from the 2014 pro-democracy mobilization in Hong Kong, participants rolled out 'crime scene' tape and shouted, \"This is a crime scene! ALEC is killing us! With private prisons and attacks on workers fueled by greed and hunger for power ALEC is killing us!\n\nThe inclusion of the Pittsburgh chapter of Students for a Democratic Society or SDS among the groups supporting the coming #DisruptJ20 event is significant because of the Davis, California SDS chapter was behind Friday night's violent anti-MILO protest at the University of California.\n\nThe SDS is a new incarnation of the 1960s radical group of the same name and has deep connections to a racist Marxist group called the Freedom Road Socialist Organization that is plotting the end of the United States as we know it by dividing the country into race-based nations.\n\nSecurity will be tight for the inaugural and members of the group Bikers for Trump will also be on hand to provide informal security.\n\nFollow Breitbart\u00a0News\u00a0investigative reporter\u00a0and\u00a0Citizen\u00a0Journalism\u00a0School founder Lee Stranahan on Twitter at\u00a0@Stranahan.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 23, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.46927356719971, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 810, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 15, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 7.24654377577, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 23, "mft_sum": 46, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170116180000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 5.67901234567901, "mft_mean": 4.18181818182}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/12/02/2-dec-16-world-view-sundays-referendum-italy-threatens-eus-stability/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1364, 2162]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 752, "scraper_regex": 810}}, "headline": "World View: Sunday\u2019s Referendum in Italy Threatens EU\u2019s Stability", "wordcount_as_scraped": 810, "date": "20161202150000", "story_content": "This morning\u2019s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com\n\nSunday\u2019s referendum in Italy threatens EU\u2019s stability\n\n\nA demonstrator calls for a \u2018no\u2019 vote on Sunday (AFP)\n\nOn Sunday, Italy will vote on a referendum which, according to prime minister Matteo Renzi, will change the constitution to make Italy more governable, and more able to cope with the future.\n\nThe referendum is important in its own right, but it became geopolitically significant in January when Renzi announced that he would resign if the referendum failed. Many analysts call this an act of hubris that was unnecessary and even disastrous, but it has been done. And now the consequences are that the referendum is less about constitutional reform, and more about whether Renzi should remain in office.\n\nAfter the spectacular failure of polling organizations to predict the result of Britain\u2019s Brexit referendum or the American presidential election, no one knows whether or not to believe polls anymore. Nonetheless, many politicians are nervous, because the poll results show that the referendum is more likely to fail than to succeed.\n\nIf the referendum fails, and if Renzi keeps his promise and resigns, and if the remaining MPs in parliament cannot find a way to select a \u201ccaretaker\u201d government that will keep things going \u2013\u00a0if all of those things occur, then there will be new elections.\n\nIt is thought that the party most likely to benefit from new elections will be the left-wing populist Five Star Movement (M5S), led by Beppe Grillo, an Italian comedian, actor, and political activist. M5S received about one-quarter of the vote in the 2013 elections, has won some major mayoral elections since then, and has become increasingly popular. And Grillo and the Five Star politicians are \u201ceuroskeptic\u201d and have said that they\u2019ll sponsor a new referendum on whether Italy should pull out of the eurozone, and possibly the European Union.\n\nSo, if there are new elections, and if the Five Star Movement and its euroskeptic allies come into power, and if they sponsor a new referendum, and if that new referendum is approved \u2013\u00a0if all of those things occur, then the stability of the eurozone and the European Union will be at risk.\n\nThat is a lot of \u201cif\u2019s\u201d that have to happen. Nonetheless, Europe\u2019s politicians have been unnerved by a series of populist setbacks, the main ones being the Brexit referendum and the American election, and they\u2019re afraid that Sunday\u2019s referendum vote in Italy will be the next one. Spiegel (Germany) and Express (London) and The Local (Italy)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nReferendum vote could affect stability of Italy\u2019s troubled banks\n\nThere is a completely different scenario where a \u201cno\u201d vote on Sunday\u2019s referendum could threaten instability of the euro.\n\nAs we have been reporting, Italy\u2019s Banco Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), founded in 1472, and the world\u2019s oldest operating bank, is close to collapse because it has $55.2 billion of bad loans on its book. Other Italian banks are in trouble as well, holding a total of about $383 billion in non-performing loans, about a third of the total in the entire eurozone.\n\nMPS has been trying to avoid collapse by trying to convince investors to lend the bank another $5 billion, despite having burned through two previous large loans.\n\nIt is believed that a \u201cno\u201d vote on Sunday\u2019s referendum will create enough uncertainty that Italy\u2019s borrowing costs might rise significantly. In fact, anticipation of a \u201cno\u201d vote has caused investors to sell off Italian bonds, pushing yields (interest rates) up to 2%, compared to just 0.3% for German bunds.\n\nIf borrowing costs increase further, then investors could be far less interested in lending MPS the $5 billion it needs to avoid collapse, and this could have a domino effect that could catastrophically affect Italy\u2019s entire banking system. In the most likely scenario, Italy\u2019s government would have to bail out the banks with taxpayer money, but this is a violation of new rules set by the European Central Bank, forcing Italy out of the eurozone.\n\nNot everyone is so pessimistic. In the optimistic scenario, it will turn out that poll results were erroneous because voters were ashamed to admit that they are voting \u201cyes\u201d on the referendum, just as they were ashamed to admit that they were voting for Brexit or Trump. The optimistic scenario also notes that the Wall Street stocks surged to new highs following Trumps\u2019 election. So in this scenario, Renzi remains in office, Italian stocks surge, MPS gets it bailout money from investors, and Italy muddles through for another year.

It is up to all of us to protect our national parks, including the President-elect and his new Interior Secretary. Mr. Zinke has expressed support for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, opposes the sale of public lands and has expressed concern over proposed mine development adjacent to Yellowstone. In contrast, Mr. Zinke has advocated for state control of energy development on federal lands, a move that threatens our national parks. Mr. Zinke has also repeatedly voted to block efforts to designate new national parks that would diversify the National Park System.\n\nThe League of Conservation Voters, a left-wing lobbying group, gave Zinke a three percent rating on its 2015 scorecard.\n\nEnvironmentalists might not be pleased with Zinke, but neither has he always voted with conservatives, or even Republicans, since joining the House of Representatives with the class of 2015.\n\nIn July, Zinke voted with Democrats to unsuccessfully block a program to transfer federal land to the states.\n\nAccording to a report in the Bozeman Daily Chronicle:\n\nZinke's crossover vote comes as the Montana Democratic Party and his opponent in the November election, Denise Juneau, try to pin the congressman to his party's support for transferring control of federal lands to the states, which, opponents say, is a step toward privatizing public lands.\nThe day after the vote, Zinke announced that he had resigned his post as a nominating delegate at the Republican National Convention over the GOP's pro-transfer platform.\n\"I've made it very clear time that I do not support the sale or transfer of federal lands,\" Zinke said in an email via his press secretary Monday. \"That's why I broke with a majority of my colleagues\u2026. Our public lands are public for a reason. I do not support any roundabout ways to get rid of the very federal lands that form our Montana way of life.\"\n\nZinke resigned as a delegate to the Republican National Convention, but he and his Spanish-speaking wife were strong supporters and surrogates for the new president.\n\nWhen the retired Navy SEAL commander endorsed Trump at a May rally in Billings, Montana, the congressman said everyone has a duty to work to turn the country around by supporting the New York City developer. \u201cWe rise and fall on the same tide,\u201d he said, adding:\n\nIt is time for us all to do our duty and it is time, Montana, to make America great again.\nPeople ask me if Donald Trump will make a great commander-in-chief\u2013well, I\u2019ll tell you what\u2013we need a commander-in-chief, who will put the interests of the United States ahead of the interests of raising money for the Clinton Foundation and we need a commander-in-chief, that will put our troops first and not abandon them in battle as Hillary Clinton did in Benghazi.\nWe need a commander-in-chief who will kill and capture our enemies, rather than catch and release them at Guantanamo Bay.\n\nThe former All-American lineman for the Oregon Ducks, who graduated with a degree in geology, said that, unlike President Barack Obama, Americans need a commander-in-chief who does not fund the nuclear weapons programs of Iran and treats veterans with respect. \u201cWe need a commander-in-chief who will put our veterans at the front of the line, rather than having them die in line waiting for health care.\u201d\n\nZinke wrote about his experiences as a Navy SEAL in a book released in the last week of November, American Commander: Serving a Country Worth Fighting For and Training the Brave Soldiers Who Lead the Way.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.48959606885909995, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 727, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.3153786416, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161214160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.1636863823934003, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/12/12/citigroup-major-sponsor-of-refugee-advocate-gathering-to-plan-opposition-to-trump-policies/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [168, 302, 1641, 1764, 2114]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 754, "scraper_regex": 919}}, "headline": "CitiGroup: Major Sponsor of Refugee Advocate Gathering to Plan Opposition to Trump Policies", "wordcount_as_scraped": 919, "date": "20161212230000", "story_content": "NASHVILLE, Tennessee\u2013CitiGroup is spending $100,000 to be a \u201cdiamond sponsor\u201d\u00a0of the ninth annual National Immigrant Integration Conference, a gathering of refugee and immigrant advocacy organizations meeting in\u00a0Nashville for three days that began on Sunday to plan opposition to President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s refugee and immigration policies.\n\nCitiGroup, one of the largest financial institutions in the world, is listed along with the Wallace H.

EngageNWA is focused on creating a community that attracts the best talent in order to promote future economic development in the Northwest Arkansas region.\n\nThe George Soros-funded Open Society Foundations is also a sponsor of the NCNC.\n\nBreitbart News contacted representatives from Bank of America, Discover Bank, and Western Union and asked why they are sponsoring the conference, but received no response.\n\nNashville Mayor Megan Barry is one of the featured speakers at the National Immigrant Integration Conference.\n\nAs a member of the City Council, Barry was a champion of the Mayor\u2019s Office of New Americans, which her predecessor Karl Dean established by executive order in 2014.\n\nBarry was elected mayor in 2015 and has aggressively promoted a pro-refugee, pro-immigrant agenda through the Mayor\u2019s Office of New Americans, whose purpose is described on its website:\n\nWithin the Mayor's Office of Neighborhoods and Community Engagement, the Mayor\u2019s Office of New Americans works to engage immigrants and empower them to participate in our government and our community.\nThe number of foreign-born residents in Nashville has more than doubled over the past decade. Nearly 12 percent of our population was born outside of the United States, and nearly half of those people are recent immigrants who entered the country since 2000. In fact, in 2012, Nashville had the fastest-growing immigrant population of any American city. Today, 30% of students enrolled in Metro Schools speak a language other than English at home.\n\nRepresentatives of several other city governments are speaking at the event, including those from New York City, Atlanta; Anchorage, Alaska; and Oakland, California.\n\nOne representative from the state of Michigan will also be speaking, as will representatives from organizations that develop public-private partnerships based in Los Angeles, Seattle, Detroit, Louisville, and Des Moines.\n\nThe Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce is also listed as a sponsor of the conference.", "metadata":

more than 1,600 people accused of being linked to the failed military coup in July 2016, including 1,218 suspected followers of the U.S.-based Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen.\n\nAmong the detainees are also suspected\u00a0Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) jihadists and\u00a0members of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), a Marxist guerrilla movement designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States, and other NATO allies.\n\nA statement released by the interior ministry Monday and published on the state-run Anadolu news agency\u00a0site\u00a0confirmed the arrests.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has designated the religious movement led by Gulen, currently in self-imposed exile in the United States, a terrorist organization \u2014 the Fethullah Terrorist Organization (FETO).\n\n\"They included 1,218 suspected members of the Fethullah Terrorist Organization held responsible for the attempted coup in July, 372 PKK suspects and 75 Daesh [ISIS] suspects,\" notes the Turkish interior ministry statement, referring to the 1,600-plus detainees, according to Anadolu.\n\nThe arrests come after the Erdogan administration issued a report earlier this month claiming\u00a0alleged cooperation between the FETO, PKK, and ISIS \u201cprior to and following the July 15 coup attempt,\u201d notes Anadolu.\n\nTurkey also accuses the United States and NATO of playing a role in the coup attempt.\n\nSpecifically, the Turkish government report claims there has been a \u201csignificant increase in the number of US-based cyber attacks against Turkey after July 15,\u201d from 97 over the three and a half months prior to the attempt to 4,437 in the three and a half month period after.\n\nAnkara alleges that the United States and NATO promised the PKK that President Erdogan \u201cwould be toppled in [the] fall [of] 2016\u2026 either he would resign himself or be forced to leave after an \u2018insurgence'\u201d led by PKK terrorists, Gulen followers (Gulenists), and members of other organizations.\n\nErdogan has accused his former ally Gulen and his supporters of orchestrating the attempted July 2016 coup to overthrow his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP).\n\nThe Turkish president has repeatedly accused the Gulen movement of conspiring to remove him from office by assembling a network of supporters in the media, judiciary, and education sectors of the country.\n\n\"More than 100,000 public officials and civil servants, including around 28,000 teachers, have been dismissed or suspended since the coup attempt which killed at least 241 citizens and police,\" reports Rudaw. \"During the attempted coup, fighter jets bombed the country's parliament.\"\n\n\"The scale of dismissals and prosecutions in connection with the coup and weakened safeguards gave rise to serious concerns that the legitimate prosecution of those suspected of involvement in the coup attempt is being conducted without due process,\" reports Human Rights Watch.\n\nMembers of the terrorist groups ISIS and the PKK have either claimed responsibility or been accused of carrying out the attacks that have killed and wounded hundreds of civilians, police, and government officials in Turkey since July 2015.\n\nThe Erdogan administration has repeatedly urged the United States to extradite Gulen.\n\nAlthough former President Barack Obama expressed a willingness to consider the extradition of the Islamic cleric, his administration requested concrete evidence linking Gulen to the coup attempt before considering Turkey's request.\n\nBoth Erdogan and Obama officials have acknowledged that Turkey has failed to produce any evidence.\n\n\"We are convinced and hopeful that, especially regarding Turkey and the US relations, the old administration's mistakes will not be repeated,\" declared Turkish Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus on Monday, renewing the Erdogan administration's calls for the American government to extradite Gulen.", "metadata":

Agenda", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1569, "date": "20170129040000", "story_content": "PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania\u2013Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R.-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R.-Ky.) told reporters Thursday at the Republicans\u2019 policy retreat here that they are committed to a 200-day program to implement the agenda of President Donald J. Trump.\n\n\u201cWe are actually having a fantastic opportunity right here in Philadelphia,\u201d said Ryan, wearing a striped button down oxford shirt and tan pants combination in keeping with the \u201cretreat\u201d atmosphere of the party\u2019s three-day series of workshops, speeches, and mixers. The Republicans arrived Wednesday morning and stayed until their working breakfast Friday.\n\nIn addition to workshops and discussions, the Republicans were visited by Trump, British Prime Minister Theresa May, and Super Bowl champion quarterback Peyton Manning.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about the improvement of people\u2019s lives and getting our country back on track,\u201d he said. \u201cHouse Republicans and Senate Republicans are working on a plan and bold agenda to get moving and work with our new administration.\u201d\n\nNew administrations have been captive to the \u201cFirst 100 Days\u201d framing ever since President Franklin D. Roosevelt came into office in 1933 with a whirlwind of legislation and administrative actions. But, Ryan said, the Republicans had developed along with the Trump White House a 200-day plan that will wrap up with the August recess.\n\nAt the end of the 200 days, Capitol Hill Republicans expect to have repealed and replaced Obamacare, filled the vacant seat on the Supreme Court, and executed the most dramatic reform of the federal tax code since President Ronald W. Reagan\u2019s flattening of tax rates in 1986.\n\nRyan said no one should be shocked by the ambitious agenda.\n\n\u201cWe ran on these issue in 2016, so there\u2019s no surprises here and the president agrees to this agenda,\u201d he said.\n\nAlong the way, the emphasis or focus is going to change, depending on whether\u00a0the messaging is coming from the White House or Capitol Hill, but Ryan insisted that he and Trump and McConnell are on the same page.\n\nMcConnell said he is working on a daily basis with the president and his staff to map out a bold and aggressive program that both fixes the problems and mistakes left by the last administration and fulfills campaign promises made in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe are on the same page,\u201d the senator said.\n\nFor some items, such as immigration or even building the wall along the Mexican border, there are no legislative fights ahead because the laws were already passed. The wall was authorized by the Secure Fence Act of 2006 and the president is going to merely enforce the immigration laws his predecessor ignored.\n\nMcConnell said a major factor in moving from the traditional 100-day plan to a 200-day plan was the Senate\u2019s confirmation workload. Dozens of appointments require Senate approval, which he said converts the Senate into the White House\u2019s personnel office.\n\n\u201cThe speaker understands the challenges of getting things done in the Senate,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s been true for 240 years, we are aware of those challenges, and we think we can move forward.\u201d\n\nThe Republican majority in the Senate is 52-to-48, which means even with Vice President Michael R. Pence available to break a tie, if three GOP senators defect, the Democrats win.\n\nThis tight margin means that the Senate Republicans do not have the votes to end debate and force a vote, which requires 60 votes.\n\nTo make an end run around lacking the votes for cloture, Republicans are forced to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act through the budget reconciliation process. In this process, the budget bills are privileged, so they must come to a vote after 50 hours of debate. The drawback to this process is that bills can only deal with budget-related issues, and whatever is passed expires in 10 years. When Congress voted to repeal Obamacare in the week before Trump was sworn in, it was really a partial repeal that gutted the fees, taxes, and fines associated with President Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare reform but left the rules and regulations in place.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D.-N.Y.) has vowed to block and delay the Republicans at every turn, when it comes to Obamacare.\n\nMcConnell said, \u201cIf Hillary Clinton were president and Chuck Schumer were the majority leader, we would be revisiting Obamacare. The status quo is clearly unacceptable. If Hillary Clinton were president and Chuck Schumer were majority leader, we\u2019d be moving toward a single-payer system.\u201d A single-payer system is one in which\u00a0all healthcare expenses are paid by the government.\n\nAnother development at the retreat was the resolve among GOP senators to fill the vacancy left by the Feb. 13, 2016 death of Justice Antonin G. Scalia.\n\nAgain the problem is the GOP\u2019s lack of 60 votes.\n\nBefore then-majority leader Sen. Harry Reid (D.-Nev.) invoked the \u201cnuclear option\u201d in 2013, all confirmations were part of the two-step process of ending debate with 60 votes and then confirming the nominee with a simple majority. Reid executed a challenge to the rule for nominees in order to break the logjam of Obama appointments\u2013blocked by the Republican minority. With this maneuver, Reid was able to fill vacancies on federal benches, at the Federal Communications Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2014 all of which led a torrent of new regulations as well as favorable rulings from newly appointed judges.\n\nWith respect to presidential appointments, Reid shattered a long-standing Senate protocol, which says that unlike the House of Representatives, the Senate works its will either through consensus or exhaustion.\n\nBut he left one piece of the protocol in place: the Supreme Court. One of the main reasons Obama\u2019s nominee to replace Scalia, Judge Merrick Garland, languished was that the 60-vote threshold was insurmountable going into the 2016 elections. Now, that same reason gives Schumer and Senate Democrats a veto over anyone Trump nominates for the high court.\n\nIt is now clear from conversations with Republican senators and staff that if ending debate on Trump\u2019s pick for the Supreme Court is blocked by Schumer, the GOP is ready to strike down the last vestige of the filibuster for presidential appointees.\n\nThe only answer a Republican senator gives for the record on the matter is: \u201cThe seat will be filled.\u201d It is the same answer every time from everyone.\n\nThe last big item is the overhaul of the federal tax code. Of all of the GOP plans, this is the one most hidden from public view.\n\nIn the past, the grand bargain of Republican tax reform proposals was to return to the ideals of the 1986 legislation, which eliminated deductions in exchange for lowering rates. Flattening the tax code, or even going to a flat tax with one rate with very few deductions,was the ultimate goal.\n\nTrump-era tax reform is something else entirely. This is full-on industrial policy and a shifting of the tax burden back onto imports and off of exports. This is not a new idea and, given the man\u2019s popularity on Broadway, it is only fitting that America returns to the essence of Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton\u2019s 1791 \u201cReport on Subject Manufactures.\u201d This was the country\u2019s economic DNA until the post-World War II shift towards America sacrificing its interests for the rest of the world.\n\nHamilton called on Congress to protect \u201cinfant industries\u201d with tariffs on imported goods, which until 1916 and the birth of the income tax provided the vast majority of federal revenues.\n\nToday, the United States runs a trade deficit of $30-to-$40 billion per month, and Republicans are ready to tap or monetize that trade gap to the tune of $1 trillion per year. How they are going to do it is beyond the scope of this course. Suffice to say, they intend to not only raise this revenue to pay for massive tax cuts, but also to remove the economic incentive for American companies to move manufacturing overseas and then ship their finished products into the United States.\n\nOf course, the ox gored in this reform is\u00a0retailers and companies which rely on imported materials but do not export. Those folks are completely aware of what is going on, and of all the fights coming to Capitol Hill in the next 200 days, the tax overhaul will be the most vicious and the most likely to break up friendships.\n\nIn the end, though Trump is the man making all of this possible, and it is Trump who will be responsible for holding things together.\n\nIt is almost surreal to hear Ryan or McConnell speak of the president with respect and affection after a campaign cycle in which neither man dared\u00a0stand up for him publicly amid crisis after crisis.\n\nYet the Republican Party is now Trump\u2019s party, with the exception of Sen. John S. McCain III (R.-Ariz.) and his sidekick Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R.-S.C.). But two rebels does not become a problem until they find a third senator. Otherwise, the Capitol Hill Republicans are on board and on duty for the president.\n\nIt is also fair to say that Trump is also on board and on duty for his congressional party. More than once in his young presidency, he has signaled that he will fight alongside his congressmen and senators and give them political cover \u2014 a luxury never enjoyed by Democrats serving under Obama.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.99004971981049, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1456, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 12, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.4573275171399995, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 40, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170129040000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.74725274725275, "mft_mean": 3.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/01/11/china-forces-japan-taiwan-south-korea-scramble-jets/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [428, 496, 554, 715, 833, 870, 1006, 1207, 1409, 1413, 1521, 1734, 1939, 2475, 2527, 2682, 2715, 3004, 3244, 3586, 4081, 4124]}}, "headline": "\u2018Routine\u2019 Chinese Military Exercises Force Japan, Taiwan, South Korea to Scramble Jets", "wordcount_as_scraped": 691, "date": "20170112030000", "story_content": "The Chinese military engaged in multiple exercises near Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan this week, forcing all three nations to scramble jets while Beijing officials insisted the display of force was a \u201cnormal\u201d event.\n\nOn Monday, China deployed \u201cat least eight\u201d warplanes to fly over the Korea Strait and through both Japan\u2019s and South Korea\u2019s\u00a0Air Defense Identification Zones (ADIZ), in addition to flying over\u00a0numerous islands claimed by both nations. The South China\u00a0Morning Post notes that neither nation claims China violated their airspace, but Chinese Air Force fighter jets did enter the ADIZs of both nations and prompted\u00a0both the South Korean military and the Japanese Self-Defense Forces to scramble fighter jets.\n\nThe Japanese newspaper\u00a0Asahi Shimbun describes the exercise\u00a0as featuring \u201cthe largest Chinese squadron to ever fly over the Tsushima Strait, which separates South Korea from Nagasaki Prefecture.\u201d\u00a0Asahi does add that it appears that Chinese pilots had a conversation with their South Korean counterparts upon entering their ADIZ, identifying the reason for their presence there as \u201ctraining.\u201d\n\nThe\u00a0South China Morning Post quotes both a People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) spokesman and a Chinese \u201cexpert\u201d cited in Chinese state media as referring to the exercise as \u201croutine\u201d and \u201cnormal,\u201d respectively.\u00a0The\u00a0People\u2019s Daily, a Chinese government news outlet, dismissed Japanese concerns with the operation, citing \u201ca\u00a0Beijing-based air defense expert\u201d who argued that Japan had \u201coverreacted\u201d to the exercises and \u201cmay have wanted to deliberately hype up the event and act as troublemakers.\u201d\n\nJapanese officials appear to disagree.\u00a0\u201cThere was likely the aim of keeping cooperation between Japan, the United States and South Korea in check,\u201d a high-ranking SDF officer told Asahi.

In a column protesting Japan\u2019s alleged overreaction to the Chinese military operating in their ADIZ, China\u2019s state-run Global Times\u00a0dismissed South Korea as \u201cjust along for the ride.\u201d\u00a0\u201cChina treats cooperation with South Korea seriously, and would like to cooperate with South Korea based on the mutual respect of security interests,\u201d the\u00a0Times quotes the Chinese Foreign\u00a0Ministry as saying.\n\nXinhua, a less opinion-oriented state outlet, warned of a \u201cprolonged feud\u201d between the two nations over the issue of Japan\u2019s use of South Korean women as sex slaves during World War II.\n\nIn addition to alarming both Japan and South Korea, the Chinese military flew an\u00a0H-6 strategic bomber over disputed territory in the South China Sea this weekend. Specifically, the aircraft flew over the Spratly Islands, which belong to Vietnam and the Philippines, but China has claimed as its own and has equipped with\u00a0military and surveillance facilities.\n\nChinese military officials once again engaged in questionable operations on Wednesday, as a fleet of Chinese warships backed by the Liaoning, the nation\u2019s only aircraft carrier, sailed through the strait separating China from Taiwan.

Bannon, a chief strategist under Mr. Trump, holds divisive views about minorities. Debates over both have sprung up in recent days. Bob Bland, one of the march\u2019s organizers, said in an email that organizers in Maryland had to change a Facebook page from public to private to protect the safety of women who want to attend.\n\nWriting at the\u00a0Week, abortion rights supporter Shikha Dalmia asserts the demonstration has already failed in its mission.\n\n\"Demonstrations serve a useful function in a democracy \u2014 but only when they have clarity of purpose,\" she writes, adding that the march is \"shaping up to be a feel-good exercise in search of a cause.\"\n\nDalmia writes some of the \"absurdity\" related to the event stems from \"the fact that they are billing this event as the voice of women when 42 percent of women (and 62 percent of non-college educated white women) actually voted for Trump.\"\n\nShe also observes \"the almost-comical progressive hysteria over the event's name.\" The initial plan by the \"three white women\" organizers, she says, was to call the event the \"Million Women March,\" but the women were criticized for \"cultural appropriation\" for \"allegedly poaching the heritage of the 1997 Million Woman March for black women.\"\n\n\"Feminists are confusing the issue by making Trump's threat about themselves,\" Dalmia concludes. \"If they really wanted to help, they would have kept their powder dry for now, rather than embark on this confused and pointless march.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.2514220476150502, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 794, "FairnessVirtue": 8, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.38798646119, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170121230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.5264483627204, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2016/12/16/peter-schweizer-facebook-fact-checking-initiative-run-by-progressive-activists/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [5968, 5981]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 937, "scraper_regex": 999}}, "headline": "Peter Schweizer: Facebook Fact-Checking Initiative Run by Progressive Activists", "wordcount_as_scraped": 999, "date": "20161216160000", "story_content": "On Friday's Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow, Clinton Cash author and Breitbart News Senior Editor Peter Schweizer said Facebook's decision to regulate \"fake news\" is a \"huge problem.\"\n\n\"Here's the thing: I've had my experience with the 'fact-checkers,' and oftentimes what they are doing is not so much checking facts and confirming, you know, \u2018Were 20,000 widgets sold by this company last year?\u2019. What they're doing is, they're re-framing stories and trying to put them into a context. So they would not confirm challenge the fact that 20,000 widgets were produced by a factory. But they would say, 'Well, this is what that really means, according to our interpretation.' That's not fact-checking, that's framing, and that's trying to contextualize in a way that advances an agenda,\" Scnweizer said.\n\n\"And as you said, when you look at these fact-check organizations, the politics is really outrageous,\" he continued. \"I looked yesterday, just a little bit, at Snopes, which started out as a website that basically would look at urban legends like 'Does Bigfoot exist?' and try to determine whether that was true or not. But what they've done is, they've migrated into politics.\" \n\n\"And when you look at the roster of people \u2013 you know, Bethania Palma, Kim LaCapria, Dan Evon to name just some of them that are in this area, or Arturo Garcia \u2013 these are all self-described 'progressives.' I'm not saying that's what they are, they describe themselves as progressives, and they write for websites in addition to Snopes like Alternet. One of them, for example, wrote an article saying conservatives have low IQs and are racists,\" he said.\n\n\"These are the people that are going to be doing the fact-checking. It's outrageous, and I think people need to raise a stink about it, because Facebook is concerned about its brand, and I think if enough people raise a stink about it, they're going to either reconsider or try to figure out a different way to do it that's far less threatening to free speech,\" Schweizer urged.\n\nAfter Marlow listed some other dubious \"fact-check\" contributors to Facebook's initiative \u2013 including ABC News, which hired Clinton operative George Stephanopoulos as a journalist \u2013 Schweizer called the situation a \"classic example of where the marketplace should decide.\"\n\n\"People are intelligent. People are smart. This audience, a lot of other people in the country, people that actually decide that they are going to pay attention to the news, and that they are going to vote and be involved in the civics of their country, they're smart and sophisticated enough,\" he argued. \"They don't need a group of self-appointed guardians to tell them what information should matter to them, and what information should not.\"\n\n\"This to me is a question of the Left trying to hold on to power. They have dominated the media for so long in this country, and it's slipped away. Large media companies are seeing either declining ratings in television, or they're seeing declining circulation in their newspapers. They're seeing that a lot of things that they would claim before in their coverage \u2013 whether it's on race in America or politics in America \u2013 it's being challenged independent media like Breitbart, like other news outlets, and they don't like it,\" he said.\n\n\"But rather than compete and win, try to win in a marketplace of ideas and a marketplace of information, they go the route of regulation. We can't compete, so we're going to get now the largest platforms for news, we're going to get them to stop or control certain people from what they're saying. It's a classic example to me of the weakness of the Left. It's the same reason, Alex, why do they need speech codes on college campuses? Is it because their ideas are so attractive and so dominant, and nobody is attracted to anything else? No, it's the opposite. It's because they can't get people, compel people, to be attracted to their ideas, that they have to try to shut off other people communicating different ideas,\" Schweizer charged.\n\nHe applauded Marlow's point that in socialism-blighted regions like South America, the public has never been exposed to competing conservative ideas, so they accept perpetual left-wing domination no matter how badly it crashes and burns. Schweizer added that a similar monopoly of ideas is being reconstructed in the United States, after years of Internet and talk-radio threats to the liberal domination of communication and education.\n\n\"This is what Facebook is saying to people, that we \u2013 Breitbart, conservative media \u2013 are so smart, and people are so stupid, people on Facebook are so stupid and moronic, that they are incapable of making their own decisions on media. And if it's a competition between Breitbart and CBS News and the Washington Post, people are going to gravitate towards Breitbart, and that's only because the people are so stupid, and Breitbart is so slick,\" Schweizer said.\n\n\"That is the premise behind everything that they are doing here, and I think we need to call them out on it,\" he advised. \"This is a huge insult to people on Facebook. It's a great pat on the back to us, but frankly I think you would say, Alex, and I do, you have to fight every day in the marketplace of ideas. There is no natural assumption that people are going to gravitate immediately to what we write.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's a sign that the ideas, and the facts, and the stories that we are presenting are what the people want, and what they want to be exposed to \u2013 and that they had been tested. Nobody wants to succumb to false news, and be stupid, and share something that is wrong. And so the entire premise of this, frankly, is a massive middle finger to the average Facebook reader, to say 'you're too stupid to do this by yourself, we're going to do it for you,'\u201d he said.\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\u00a0to 9:00 a.m.\u00a0Eastern.\n\nLISTEN:\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.3364486694335898, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 937, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.1354541815299999, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 8, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161216160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 0.8537886872998929, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.7272727272730001}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/12/15/9-reasons-politifact-unqualified-label-fake-news/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [146, 184, 612, 759, 823, 904, 919, 1035, 1112, 1245, 1260, 1273, 1331, 1402, 1486, 1509, 1600, 1614, 1632, 1684, 2275, 2550, 2604, 2651, 3152, 3460, 3530, 3601, 3749, 3842, 4002, 4016, 4027]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 601, "scraper_regex": 641}}, "headline": "9 Reasons Why PolitiFact Is Unqualified to Label \u2018Fake News\u2019", "wordcount_as_scraped": 641, "date": "20161216110000", "story_content": "Left-leaning PolitiFact is on the newly revealed list of \u201cfact checking\u201d organizations\u00a0Facebook will reportedly use to label\u00a0\u201cfake news\u201d stories as they appear on the social media platform.\n\n\u201cWe'll use the reports from our community, along with other signals, to send stories to these organizations,\" Facebook VP Adam Mosseri wrote in the Facebook news blog. \"If the fact checking organizations identify a story as fake, it will get flagged as disputed and there will be a link to the corresponding article explaining why.\"\n\nFacebook\u2019s decision to tout\u00a0PolitiFact as a credible and independent fact checker is awfully disturbing, given the organization\u2019s repeated smear campaign against Donald Trump\u00a0throughout the 2016 election.\n\nFacebook\u2019s \u201cfake news\u201d flaggers,\u00a0Politifact, et al., have a history of showing sympathy for left-wing narratives.\u00a0Time and again\u00a0PolitiFact published stories that favored Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy, while promoting \u201cfact checks\u201d meant to rebut\u00a0or embarrass Republicans.\n\nBelow is a list of the many instances proving why\u00a0Politifact is completely unqualified to be an objective judge of what\u2019s real and \u201cfake\u201d news.\n\n1. Last March, PolitiFact delivered a\u00a0\u201cmostly false\u201d\u00a0rating for a\u00a0joke made by Republican Senator Ted Cruz.\n\n2. Last April,\u00a0PolitiFact made phone calls and sent a reporter to investigate whether\u00a0Governor Scott Walker actually \u201cpaid one dollar for\u201d a sweater he bought at Kohl's.\u00a0PolitiFact later ruled\u00a0Walker\u2019s claim \u201ctrue.\u201d\n\n3. When Trump said Clinton wants \u201copen borders,\u201d PolitiFact deemed\u00a0his statement\u00a0\u201cmostly false\u201d \u2014 \u00a0despite the fact that Clinton admitted as much in a\u00a0private, paid speech to a Brazilian bank on May 16, 2013. \u201cMy dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders,\u201d she said at the time.\n\n4. PolitiFact cast doubts on comments Pat Smith made during her emotional speech at the Republican National Convention, where she said Hillary Clinton said \u201ca video was responsible\u201d for her son\u2019s death during the terror attacks in Benghazi.\n\nSmith was referring to when she \u201csaw Hillary Clinton at Sean's coffin ceremony,\u201d and then-Secretary of State Clinton \u201clooked me squarely in the eye and told me a video was responsible.\u201d\n\nBut\u00a0PolitiFact, taking an oddly defensive stance, said Smith\u2019s memory could\u2019ve been \u201cfuzzy\u201d and referred its readers, instead, to a \u201cbrief meeting behind closed doors\u201d where Clinton addressed the families of the victims of the attack.\n\n5. Despite video evidence to the contrary,\u00a0PolitiFact claimed Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t laugh about\u00a0Kathy Shelton's rape as a child. Trump invited\u00a0Shelton to the second presidential debate and called out Clinton\u2019s embarrassing behavior.\n\nAgain, moving to dismiss and downplay Clinton\u2019s actions, PolitiFact wrote: \u201cTrump is referring to an audio tape in which she does respond with amusement at her recollections of the oddities of the case, which involve the prosecution and the judge. At no point does she laugh at the victim.\u201d\n\n6. In an attempt to explain Hillary Clinton\u2019s role in the sale of 25 percent of the United States\u2019 uranium stockpile,\u00a0Politifact ignored numerous key facts, downplayed other key facts, and ultimately made 13 errors in its analysis.\n\n7. A few months later, PolitiFact was, again, attempting to whitewash Clinton\u2019s role in the Russian uranium deal. Like PolitiFact\u2019s first foray into the subject, the second report commits many\u00a0factual errors and is full of glaring inaccuracies and omissions.\n\n8.\u00a0During a televised campaign event, Clinton said Australia\u2019s compulsory\u00a0gun buyback program \u201cwould be worth considering\" in the U.S.\n\nWhen the National Rifle Association included Clinton\u2019s comments on one of its flyers,\u00a0PolitiFact ruled the organization\u2019s claim \u201cmostly false.\u201d\n\n9. While Politifact admitted that\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that Russia\u2019s arsenal of nuclear warheads has expanded and the U.S.\u2019s has not, the left-wing outfit deemed Trump\u2019s statement \u201chalf true.\u201d\n\nFollow\u00a0Jerome Hudson\u00a0on Twitter\u00a0@jeromeehudson", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.861111164093019, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 601, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.5048132143000001, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 10, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161216110000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.6638935108153101, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.909090909091}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/news/trump-amid-combative-start-pledges-to-rise-to-moment/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00f1": [3089]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 881, "scraper_regex": 934}}, "headline": "Trump, amid combative start, pledges to rise to moment", "wordcount_as_scraped": 934, "date": "20170123070000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 After a combative start to his presidency, Donald Trump delivered a more unifying message Sunday and sought to reassure Americans he was up to the daunting task ahead, as he turned to the business of government.\n\nSpeaking in the White House East Room during a swearing-in ceremony for top aides, the president warned his staff of future challenges but declared he believed they were ready.\n\n\u201cBut with the faith in each other and the faith in God, we will get the job done,\u201d the president said. \u201cWe will prove worthy of this moment in history. And I think it may very well be a great moment in history.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s reassurance came after a day marked by global protests against his presidency and his own complaints about media coverage of his inauguration. He said his staff was in the White House not to \u201chelp ourselves\u201d but to \u201cdevote ourselves to the national good.\u201d\n\nTrump held up the letter left to him by his predecessor, Barack Obama \u2014 a White House tradition. \u201cIt was really very nice of him to do that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe will cherish that.\u201d He said the contents will remain private.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Trump offered a scattershot response to the sweeping post-inauguration protests a day earlier, sarcastically denigrating the public opposition and then defending demonstrators\u2019 rights a short time later.\n\n\u201cWatched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election! Why didn\u2019t these people vote? Celebs hurt cause badly,\u201d Trump tweeted early Sunday morning. Ninety-five minutes later, he struck a more conciliatory tone.\n\n\u201cPeaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy. Even if I don\u2019t always agree, I recognize the rights of people to express their views,\u201d the president tweeted, still using his personal account.\n\nThe dueling tweets marked his administration\u2019s first response to the more than 1 million people who rallied at women\u2019s marches in Washington and cities across the world. Hundreds of protesters lined the street as Trump\u2019s motorcade drove past on Saturday afternoon, with many screaming and chanting.\n\nThe Washington rally appeared to attract more people than attended Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday, but there were no completely comparable numbers. Regional transportation officials tweeted on Sunday that 1,001,616 trips were taken on the rail system on Saturday. Metro spokesman Dan Stessel had said that on Friday, the day of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, just over 570,000 trips were taken on the rail system.\n\nEven suggestions of weak enthusiasm for his inauguration clearly irked the new president, and appeared to knock the White House off its footing as it took its earliest steps.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump\u2019s spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who told his Cabinet that the call would cover the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Syria, Iran and other issues. Trump said the call was \u201cvery nice\u201d but provided no details.\n\nTrump also announced that he\u2019s set up meetings with the prime minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, and Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to start some negotiations having to do with NAFTA,\u201d he said of his meeting with Mexico, along with immigration and security at the border. Trump has promised to build a wall along the length of the southern border and insisted that Mexico will pay for it.\n\nTrump had no plans to sign any executive orders on Sunday. But his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d the president would spend his first full week in office undoing some of his predecessor\u2019s agenda and planned to sign executive orders on immigration and trade.\n\nTrump has pledged to scuttle trade deals such as a pending Asia-Pacific agreement and overturn Obama\u2019s executive order deferring deportations for 700,000 people who were brought into the country illegally as minors.\n\nTrump plans to meet Monday with a bipartisan group congressional leaders to discuss his agenda.\n\nLater in the week, he\u2019ll address congressional Republicans at their retreat in Philadelphia and meet with British Prime Minister Theresa May.\n\nIn talk show interviews Sunday, Trump\u2019s advisers defended his criticism of journalists for correctly reporting that his inauguration drew a smaller crowd President Barack Obama did eight years ago, saying the Trump administration was supplying \u201calternative facts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way to really quantify crowds. We all know that. You can laugh at me all you want,\u201d Kellyanne Conway told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet The Press.\u201d She added: \u201cI think it\u2019s actually symbolic of the way we\u2019re treated by the press.\u201d\n\nAides also made clear that Trump will not release his tax returns now that he\u2019s taken office, breaking with a decades-long tradition of transparency. Every president since 1976 has released the information, but Trump has said he doesn\u2019t believe Americans care whether he follows suit.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Trump refused to make his filings public, saying they\u2019re under audit by the Internal Revenue Service and he\u2019d release them only once that review is complete. Tax experts and IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said such audits don\u2019t bar taxpayers from releasing returns.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to release his tax returns. We litigated this all through the election.  People didn\u2019t care,\u201d Conway said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nTrump, whose 12th wedding anniversary was Sunday, also attended a reception for law enforcement officers and first responders who helped with his inauguration. He singled out the work of FBI Director James Comey, whom he offered a handshake and hug.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nReach Lerer on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@llerer and Lemire at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.5511893033981299, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 881, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.64106164479, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170123070000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.1782065834279196, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/01/19/tripp-fake-news-double-standard-trump-dossier/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1605, 3991, 4348, 4497, 4749, 4762, 5061]}}, "headline": "Tripp \u2013 'Fake News' Double Standard on Donald Trump 'Dossier'", "wordcount_as_scraped": 863, "date": "20170120020000", "story_content": "The Obama administration, senior members of the intelligence community and much of the news media have expressed panic over an unverified \"dossier\" of evidence against President-elect Donald Trump and outrage at the formerly acclaimed organization Wikileaks. This compared to the relative apathy towards one of the largest security hacks in the federal government's history, belies a double-standard that can only be political.\n\nBreaches that aid the left are dismissible, even laudable, while those that reveal facts that undermine the left's sugarcoated version of Obama's legacy are existential threats to America.\n\nTake for instance, the Obama administration's response to the hack of the United States Office of Personnel Management revealed in 2015. The hack appears to be one of the largest, if not the largest, breaches of government data in the history of the United States. This massive theft included all personally identifiable information, including unencrypted social security numbers, within 21.5 million government records. The hackers got away with 5.6 million government employee fingerprints.\n\nWith the successful targeted hack of the Central Personnel Data File, the hackers came into possession of all personnel data for every single federal employee, retiree and up to one million former federal employees. This included federal judges. This endangered many, none more than undercover operatives. The government they swore to serve was curiously AWOL.\n\nThe OPM theft was aimed at the heart of the United States government.\u00a0 Far reaching implications will reverberate for years. Officials believe the Chinese perpetrated this breach.\n\nAt the time, FBI Director James Comey called it \"a very big deal from a national security perspective and from a counterintelligence perspective.\" \"It's a treasure trove of information about everybody who has worked for, tried to work for, or works for the United States government,\" he noted. One wonders what he did about it.\n\nWhere OPM was concerned, as with all previous government hacks, presidential outrage was simply MIA. The absence of action to swiftly punish the Chinese \u2013 or to even definitely identify that it was, in fact, the Chinese \u2013 are small indicators. Comments from officials are much larger ones.\n\n\"You have to kind of salute the Chinese for what they did,\" Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, said of the hacking. In one cavalier sentence he not only acknowledged the Chinese hacking of our OPM, but tipped his hat to them. Stunning. A year later, deep into campaign season, he did not salute \"the Russians.\"\n\nOvertly, virtually nothing happened in retaliation for this massive breach. Apparently the IC was not directed to show outrage, so the overall response was lukewarm and underwhelming to say the least.\n\nCompare the administration's subdued reaction to this with the immediate action taken in the face of the hack of the DNC and publication of emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.\n\nWikileaks \u2013 an organization that earned so much political capital with the left that, even after the Podesta emails, liberals praised Obama's release of leaker Chelsea Manning \u2013 released thousands of emails from that account. The emails revealed the Clinton machine to be a cynical, calculating one, convinced the American people were stupid enough to buy into a completely fabricated Hillary Clinton personality. Clinton lost the election.\n\nThe intelligence community immediately began pointing the blame at Russia. President Obama asserted that he had told his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to \"cut it out.\" He levied economic sanctions on Russia. The IC has yet to prove Russia was behind the \"hack,\" which Wikileaks insists was a leak from the inside.\n\nIt doesn't take a national security expert to question the recent extraordinary behavior of President Obama's Intelligence Community, nor do I claim in any way to be one.\u00a0 Rather, my years exposed to the highest levels of government, to include the White House and the Department of Defense, provide a clarity of perspective I feel compelled to share.\n\nFrom the President on down, we see politically driven double standards, not only in the upper echelons of the FBI but also throughout the whole of our Intelligence Community.\u00a0 Nothing was done when the Chinese infiltrated a government agency perpetrating one of the largest and most dangerous hacks in our nation's history.\u00a0 Everything but the kitchen sink was quickly thrown at the Russians for ostensibly trying to influence a presidential election.\n\nOne hack only hurt millions of Americans, the other was perceived to have caused political damage to their very own party.\u00a0 No contest.\u00a0 It smacks of an indifference to the wellbeing of everyday Americans in favor of political interests. This is precisely why the election results were what they were. People are sick of it.\n\nLinda Tripp worked in both the Bill Clinton administration and the George H.W. Bush White House.

Pastors have been under attack in Texas and their sermons sought to be compelled during litigation by a government unit. The pastors were in a fight over a transgender bathroom ordinance at the time they were subpoened.\n\nTexas State Senators Joan Huffman (R-Houston) and Kelly Hancock (R-Richland Hills) have filed the bill that is intended to protect religious leaders from production of a written copy or audio or video recording of their sermons. The bill relates to holding their sermons privileged from disclosure to a governmental entity.\n\nIn 2014, Breitbart Texas reported\u00a0that a group of pastors in Houston were fighting efforts by the city to subpoena their sermons and their private communications with church members. The subpoenas were related to litigation from a petition to repeal openly gay Mayor Annise Parker's controversial Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (\"HERO\"). Breitbart Texas reported that among other concerns, the ordinance was criticized for allowing men in women's restrooms. Opponents collected nearly 50,000 signatures to repeal the measure. Although only 17,269 signatures were required, the City Attorney invalidated the signatures and opponents promised a legal battle. The subpoenas were issued as part of the litigation.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott sent a letter warning City Attorney David Feldman that Houstonians and their religious leaders \u201cmust be absolutely secure in the knowledge that their religious affairs are beyond the reach of the government.\"\u00a0 He wrote \"Nothing short of an immediate reversal by your office will provide that security.\u00a0I call on you to withdraw the subpoenas without further delay.\"\n\nBreitbart Texas was at the press conference when Senator Ted Cruz gathered with Houston area pastors to address the City of Houston and Mayor Parker's \"unchecked government power\" and \"assault on religious liberty.\"\u00a0The event attracted a large press corps after the City received national attention after issuing subpoenas to five Houston-area pastors.\n\nA \u201cgovernmental unit\u201d as the bill applies to includes the state and its agencies, and any political subdivision of the states such as city, counties, school districts, junior college districts, water control and improvement districts, emergency service organizations, and other subdivisions. Any institution, agency, or organ of goverment that is derived from the Texas Constitution or laws passed by the Texas Legislature is included.\n\n\u201cOne of my top priorities is to protect our First Amendment right to religious liberty, something we particularly treasure during the holiday season. SB24 will give pastors critical protection from forced testimony and shield sermons from government subpoena power,\u201d Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick said in a released statement obtained by Breitbart Texas.\n\nThe act would be effective immediately upon its passage if it receives a vote of two-third of all the members elected to each house, or if not immediately effective \u2013 September 1, 2017.\n\nBreitbart Texas contacted Rev. Dave Welch, president of Texas Pastor Council. He responded in an email:\n\n\u201cSpeaking on behalf of the pastors who were actually subpoenaed for seventeen different categories of materials and communications, I am very curious as to why neither sponsoring Senator of SB 24 bothered talking to us or our legal counsel about what might be needed. This bill dealing only with sermons is very limited. Our subpoenas included, \u2018All communications with members of your congregation regarding HERO or the Petition\u2019 (emphasis added).\u00a0 The definition of \u2018communications\u2019 was far beyond sermons, even including \"exchange of \u2026opinion,\u2019\u00a0and trampled on myriad First Amendment rights of pastors.\nWe would be happy to assist legislators to craft bills that effectively address these threats. Our pastors are already protected by the God who called them to pulpit ministry, the United States Constitution and the courage that compels them to refuse to be intimidated or silenced by any threats from any source, including those who would abuse public office in such a way.\u201d\n\nLana Shadwick\u00a0is a writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

The decision appears to be an \"in your face\" move in response to the incoming president's threat to defund similar cities.\n\nThe mayor and city council of Boulder directed the city attorney's office to draft an ordinance for either the council's January 3 or 17 meeting. It was not confirmed if the draft would contain the word \"sanctuary.\"\n\nThe Daily Camera reported:\n\nCouncilwoman Mary Young said that Boulder might do better to keep \u201csanctuary\u201d out of any action it takes so as to at least try to minimize attention of the Trump administration. She also said that immigration workers she\u2019s spoken to believe that action is more important than words, and that a city calling itself a sanctuary is not as meaningful as some believe.\n\u201cWhat matters is that we have the force of law behind it,\u201d Young said. \u201cThat we walk the walk was more important to them than talking the talk.\u201d\n\nThe City of Boulder\u00a0appears to\u00a0already be in violation of federal law requiring local officials to cooperate with immigration authorities.\n\nThe Boulder police chief, Greg Testa, told the local news outlet, \"We do not detain anybody based on immigration status and we do not report immigration status to the federal government.\u201d\n\nThe sanctuary\u00a0policy would likely put the City in violation of Section 1373 of Title 8 of the United States Code. The law was passed in 1996 during the administration of President Bill Clinton to force local and state jurisdictions to cooperate with immigration officials or risk losing federal funding, Breitbart Texas reported in November. Part of the process requires the federal agency's office of inspector general to certify that a jurisdiction is not in compliance in order to block funding.\n\nThe previously unenforced law could now become the tool for the Trump Administration to use to quickly force sanctuary cities into compliance, U.S. Representative John Culberson told Breitbart Texas earlier this month.\n\n\"The law requires cooperation with immigration officials 100 percent of the time,\" Culberson told Breitbart Texas. In February, Culberson provided Attorney General Lynch with a list of more than\u00a0300\u00a0sanctuary cities\u00a0compiled by the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nSince that time, the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General has certified 10 of these jurisdictions as sanctuary jurisdictions and the top ten have been notified they will not be eligible for federal law enforcement grants in the coming year.\n\nThe City of Boulder is not currently on the list of 300 sanctuary jurisdiction, but Boulder County is. The Boulder County sheriff has, along with other Colorado sheriff's announced they will not honor immigration detainers issued by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Between January 2014 and September 2015, Boulder County officials refused to honor 19 immigration detainers, eight of which were for illegal aliens with prior criminal histories, CIS reported.\n\nThe Daily Camera reported a Colorado law passed in 2013 allowed the state's sheriff's to not notify ICE when there was probable cause to believe the inmate was an illegal alien. That law could place the State of Colorado in the same status as the States of California and Connecticut who have already been certified by the DOJ as not being in compliance with the law.\n\nSince the Colorado law was passed in 2013, \"the state's sheriff's declared they would not honor Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainers,\" the local newspaper reported.\n\n\"The critical steps (for cutting federal funding to sanctuary cities) have already been taken,\" Chairman Culberson stated previously. \"President Trump and Attorney General Sessions will, on day one, be able to strip the funding from these sanctuary jurisdictions simply by enforcing existing law.\"\n\n\"The timing on this action by the DOJ is perfect,\" Culberson told Breitbart Texas. \u201cThe new administration can go right to work to force these jurisdictions to comply or simply choose to stop receiving federal money.\"\n\nBob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

Trump's administration will be ready to go on day one thanks to a \"dream team\" cabinet and a largely unprecedented transition process that has flowed smoothly.\n\nThe cabinet, Spicer argued, is not only filled with talented people of \"quality and caliber\" that Democrats can't legitimately oppose, but, he said, it is the \"most talented cabinet in modern history.\"\n\n\"I think not only are we ahead of schedule, which is historically important, but I think number two if you look at the quality of these individuals, the Democrats are basically trying to figure out how they can oppose these folks and they're coming up empty because of the quality and caliber of each of these individuals,\" Spicer said in a phone interview. \"When you look at them, they might not agree with them, but they have to admit these are some very successful people in their various fields. And they're probably, when you rate this cabinet overall, there's no question it's by far holistically the most talented cabinet in modern history.\"\n\nSpicer said the cabinet Trump has assembled, from Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) as Attorney General to Gen. John Kelly as Homeland Security Secretary to Gen. James \"Mad Dog\" Mattis at the Pentagon to Dr. Ben Carson at Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and more, is a \"dream team.\"\n\n\"In Department after Department, you are literally getting the Dream Team of a cabinet,\" Spicer said.\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill have put together an aggressive hearing and confirmation schedule in the U.S. Senate for Trump's nominees. Sessions is up first, with hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday and Wednesday this week, and then Kelly, who will have his hearings on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, Trump's pick to lead the State Department, will testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday morning running simultaneously with hearings to confirm Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-KS), Trump's CIA director pick, and incoming Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.\n\nThursday will see hearings for Mattis, Carson, and billionaire Wilbur Ross\u2014Trump's incoming Commerce Secretary\u2014with hearings for his Labor Secretary Andy Puzder, a fast food executive, tentatively set for early next week. At a media briefing on Monday in Washington, Spicer told reporters that for each of these officials who have hearings this week their paperwork has already been submitted to the proper vetting entities, such as the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), and is expected to be cleared\u00a0in short order.\n\nMichigan's Betsy DeVos\u2014Trump's nominee to run the Department of Education\u2014is scheduled for January 17.\n\nHearings have yet to be set for incoming Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a Goldman Sachs executive; incoming Energy Secretary and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry; incoming Health and Human Services Secretary Rep. Tom Price (R-GA); and incoming Interior Secretary Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-MT), a decorated Navy SEAL Commander before his career in politics \u2014 but those hearings are expected soon.\n\nTrump has not yet selected an Agriculture Secretary or a Veterans Affairs Secretary, but is expected to make those selections shortly. Hearings and confirmation is expected soon, as well, for cabinet-level administration slots such as\u00a0the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator position, which will go to Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt; for incoming Office of Management and Budget (OMB) director Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-SC), incoming United Nations Ambassador and outgoing South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, incoming Small Business Administration administrator Linda McMahon, and incoming U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer.\n\n\"Then there's the logistical side, and I think that from a logistics standpoint, this transition is firing on all cylinders,\" Spicer continued in his exclusive interview with Breitbart News. He continued:\n\nWhen you think about it, the way we have set it up we have over 300 people on these landing teams across the agencies to make sure that literally on day one it's the end of business as usual and immediate change comes to Washington across the entire government. But the other thing is, the process itself of preparing the government and preparing the nominees, we have probably had the most comprehensive process to make sure that our nominees for every office are prepared and are able to implement change on day one. There is a team around each one of these folks to make sure they are ready to go.\n\nAround each of these people, as they've been selected, has been a \"Sherpa team\" helping them prepare for the confirmation process and getting them ready to go through U.S. Senate hearings and get started as soon as they are confirmed. Previous administrations have used Sherpa teams, but Spicer told Breitbart News a new development\u2014one of many \"firsts\" for the Trump transition that no previous administration transition has used\u2014is that they include media preparedness to be ready to answer questions the media may have for them. The Sherpa teams also include legislative, policy, and other officials to help the cabinet and cabinet-level nominees prepare for Senate hearings and for governing the minute they are confirmed. Spicer went on to say:\n\nI'll give you an example of this, and this comes from what I call the 'firsts.\u2019 When we set up the Sherpa teams, it's a team of when someone gets nominated, already in place is a Sherpa team. It's literally a team that is ready to go when the person is nominated, or chosen, because even before it's official we're ready to get around them. There's a team leader, there's somebody working the legislative side, somebody who's working the policy side, the logistics, and then there's a media person\u2014and then each one of those people has a team that they work with. So in other words, it's not just one person getting it\u2014there's a team in each one of those buckets so that there's somebody to answer the media questions, to prepare them for questions to come up, somebody to prepare them for their legislative visits and meetings, there's somebody making sure all their paperwork is ready to go and filed and gathered up because it\u2019s a pretty laborious process. The reason each one of these things is going smoothly is because we've got all of the systems in place and the transition team has done just a phenomenal job and they were ready to go with all these Sherpa teams and there was planning that has been getting done so that when we had nominees in place that all of this could be executed flawlessly.\n\nAnother first, Spicer noted, is\u00a0that Trump will be the first Republican president since 1929, with the Herbert Hoover administration,\u00a0to come into office with a combination of a GOP majority in both chambers of Congress, a majority of GOP governorships nationwide, and a Supreme Court vacancy to fill. Trump is expected to make his Supreme Court justice selection to replace the late Antonin Scalia shortly after the inauguration, but this combination\u2014a GOP controlled Congress, GOP control in the states, the ability to make an immediate appointment to the Supreme Court\u2014means Trump will make his mark on history quickly.\n\nThis is also the first presidential transition officially run out of an institutionalized General Services Administration (GSA) facility, something all future transitions will follow; but Spicer notes that the Trump team is \"blazing the trail\" on this front. Add all of that to the new way to solicit talent for federal jobs through GreatAgain.gov, and social media involvement in this transition, run by Dan Scavino, Trump's Social Media Director\u2014and this transition is unlike any other in history.\n\nIt is expected that shortly after these committee hearings, this week and in the coming weeks, the Republican-led panels will confirm the various nominees to send them to a vote before the full GOP-controlled U.S. Senate for confirmation. There, it is expected, every single one of Trump's cabinet nominees will be easily confirmed and most should receive wide bipartisan support, Spicer and other officials say.\n\nConfirmation votes are likely to happen quickly in the coming weeks, perhaps as soon as Inauguration Day\u2014January 20\u2014as Republicans helped to do when now-outgoing President Barack Obama was taking office in 2009. In fact, a whopping seven cabinet officials were confirmed on Jan. 20, 2009\u2014Obama's Inauguration Day\u2014and five more were confirmed by the end of the first week of his presidency. In all, 13 of Obama\u2019s nominees for cabinet slots were confirmed by voice vote\u2014and Republicans have made clear they fully expect Democrats to agree to these same terms for Trump.\n\nIt is not las if Democrats can do much to stop them. With GOP control of the Senate, and Democrats having enacted the nuclear option when they were in the majority, a simple majority of 51 votes\u2014which can be achieved with Republicans alone every time if needed, despite the fact that Trump's nominees are expected to receive bipartisan support across the board\u2014is all that is needed to confirm them.\n\nThat reality isn't stopping Democrats such as\u00a0Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer from playing politics with the matter, as he posted a nasty message at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Facebook Monday. But Republicans expect the political gamesmanship will end soon so the federal government can focus on getting Americans back to work and dealing with the many problems this great nation faces.\n\n\"It's like anything else, I think that the sooner that you're ready to go the sooner you can actually execute,\" Spicer explained, noting how important it is the full government be ready as soon as possible. \"So if you get hired on day one, you bring on a new employee at Breitbart, you say 'okay, on Friday you come get your computer and next Monday get your ID,' and you're like 'I'm ready to go,' so the more that we can logistically get the nominees in a position to be ready to execute an agenda of change the quicker it all starts to happen.\"\n\nThis smooth transition process, Spicer said, wouldn't be possible without Trump's businessman-like approach at the top. It's his management style, Spicer said, that has led to this peaceful, quick, and effective transition from the Obama administration to the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\"It's all driven by it [Trump's style of management],\" Spicer said. \"If you know that this is the kind of process that he's going to demand, then you instinctively start to act that way. You know that he's going to have an expectation that things are going to get done in a manner like that. The people that are in charge proactively started to think ahead to make sure this is done, because this is going to be expected of us.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.48717951774597, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1741, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.8397658330800004, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170110070000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.72314761631246, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/news/suspect-in-iowa-officers-deaths-was-desperate-for-money/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Iowa Cop Killing Suspect  Was Desperate for Money; Court Ordered Him to Leave Mother\u2019s Home over Abuse Allegations", "wordcount_as_scraped": 830, "date": "20161104000000", "story_content": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 An Iowa man charged Thursday with killing two police officers was facing intense money problems, had been found by a judge to hit and financially exploit his mother and was ordered to move out of her basement hours before the slayings.\n\nScott Michael Greene, 46, was arrested Thursday afternoon after detectives questioned him at the Des Moines police station. Greene was secured with the handcuffs that had belonged to the patrolmen who were killed in ambush-style attacks, Des Moines Sgt. Anthony Beminio and Urbandale officer Justin Martin, and was booked into the county jail.\n\nGreene was charged with two counts of first-degree murder. If convicted, he would receive an automatic sentence of life in prison without parole. A statement from Des Moines police said the investigation has produced probable cause to support the charges.\n\nPolice said earlier Thursday that a search dog recovered a high-powered rifle in a wooded area that they believe Greene used to fire on the officers. Greene had been hospitalized for treatment of a pre-existing medical condition following his surrender Wednesday morning. He left the hospital Thursday.\n\nGreene, an unemployed father who lived in the Des Moines suburb of Urbandale, was increasingly desperate for money in recent weeks, court records show.\n\nDistrict Judge Carla Schemmel ruled Tuesday that Greene had committed elder abuse against his 66-year-old mother, Patricia Greene, by \u201cphysically hitting and financially exploiting\u201d her. She ordered him to move out of his mother\u2019s home, where he had been living in a basement bedroom, before Nov. 6 and to stay away from the home for a year.\n\nPatricia Greene had applied for the restraining order Oct. 19, two days after she was arrested and charged with striking her son in the face during an altercation that he had recorded with his cellphone. She wrote in the application that she believed her son \u201cset me up to get me in trouble.\u201d Patricia Greene wrote that while she was in jail, Scott Greene told one of her friends that Patricia Greene needed to give him $20,000 and that if his mother paid, \u201che would move and not bother\u201d her again.\n\nPatricia Greene also wrote that her son had sent an acquaintance \u201ca bunch of rambling, offensive\u201d text messages, warned that he would no longer take care of her cat and was going through her personal belongings. She said her son had subjected her to mental, emotional and financial abuse.\n\nA temporary protective order was issued Oct. 20. Schemmel issued the permanent order during Tuesday\u2019s hearing, where it was served on Scott Greene. The order, which warned that any violations would lead to his arrest, also directed Greene to return $10,000 to his mother and to not take any of her assets.\n\nBeminio, 38, and Martin, 24, were shot after 1 a.m. Wednesday while sitting in their patrol cars in separate incidents less than 2 miles apart. Several bullets were fired into the vehicles.\n\nThe .223-caliber rifle believed to be used was discovered Wednesday by a police dog apparently hidden in a wooded area \u201cwhere no person probably could have found it,\u201d said Des Moines police spokesman Sgt. Paul Parizek.\n\nParizek became emotional Thursday during a news conference, where he thanked the community for its outpouring of support and said the officers represent \u201cthe security blanket you guys sleep under every night.\u201d He said a motive for the shootings remains unclear.\n\nGreene was hired last month to work at Central Iowa Fencing, a small construction business in suburban Des Moines, but quit within days, a manager there said Thursday.\n\nGreene \u201cwas pretty desperate\u201d for a job and told the company he had a teenage daughter he needed to support, officer manager Sara Nicklin said. He has at least two other children. Court records show he has another daughter who is an adult, and the Iowa National Guard confirmed Thursday that his 26-year-old son is a member.\n\nGreene initially contacted the company looking for work last summer but there were no openings. The company gave Greene a chance after he inquired again last month, even though he had no experience building fences, Nicklin said.\n\nShe said Greene was sent home on the morning of his third day of employment \u201cbecause he was not taking directions and wasn\u2019t working.\u201d Nicklin said the company gave Greene the chance to come back the next day on a different crew but \u201che chose not to show up\u201d and quit instead.\n\n\u201cHe just didn\u2019t like the work,\u201d Nicklin said.\n\nGreene posted a video on YouTube last week of a cellphone recording showing a worker driving a truck. Greene wrote below the video that he \u201cwas fired\u201d by Central Iowa Fencing after reporting unsafe driving.\n\nNicklin said she hasn\u2019t seen the video but denied that Greene was fired. She said investigators have contacted the business, which has about 20 workers.\n\n\u201cWe wish we never would have contact with this person,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re all devastated.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.14018678665161, "HarmVice": 9, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 813, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 14, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.07139115672, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 43, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161104000000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.9090909090900006, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 5.2890528905289, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/12/13/13-dec-16-world-view-italys-bank-crisis-seems-likely-cost-thousands-people-savings/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 590, "scraper_regex": 654}}, "headline": "World View: Italy\u2019s Bank Crisis Seems Likely to Cost Thousands of People Their Savings", "wordcount_as_scraped": 654, "date": "20161213150000", "story_content": "This morning\u2019s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com\n\nEgypt\u2019s Christians demand revenge after Sunday\u2019s church bombing\n\n\nEgyptian Christians shout slogans in front of riot police outside a Cairo church on Monday (Reuters)\n\nEgyptian Christians are blaming the government for Sunday\u2019s suicide bombing that killed 24 people and injured 49 in a chapel adjacent to St. Mark's Cathedral, Cairo's largest church and home of Coptic Pope Tawadros II. Some are demanding the fall of the regime.\n\nAccording to witnesses, the police did not perform the usual checks and searches of people entering the Church. According to one witness, \u201cThere were police cars stationed in front of the church gates\u2026 They were too busy eating breakfast and drinking tea and soda. They weren't doing their job.\u201d\n\nEgypt\u2019s president Abdel al-Fattah al-Sisi blamed the Muslim Brotherhood. However, the Muslim Brotherhood has denied this, and no one has claimed responsibility, but the only people celebrating on social media were supporters of the so-called Islamic State (IS or ISIS or ISIL or Daesh), who wrote, \u201cGod bless the person who did this blessed act.\u201d Al Arabiya and Reuters and AFP\n\nRelated Articles\n\nItaly\u2019s bank crisis seems likely to cost thousands of people their savings\n\nWe\u2019ve been reporting Italy\u2019s banking crisis for a while now, and there has always been uncertainty about which of several paths it would take. After the events of the last week, a lot of that uncertainty has vanished, but the result isn\u2019t what would be hoped.\n\nItaly held a referendum last Sunday on a change to the constitution that would make Italy\u2019s government more stable. Prime minister Matteo Renzi had promised to resign if the referendum was defeated. Italy\u2019s Banco Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), founded in 1472, and the world\u2019s oldest operating bank, was hoping that the referendum would pass, since they believed that would make it more likely that investors would lend the bank 5 billion euros to make a debt repayment and avoid a bank crisis for a few more months.\n\nWell, the referendum was voted down. Renzi resigned, as promised. Italy has a new prime minister, the outgoing foreign minister, Paolo Gentiloni, who took office on Monday. But whether investors would lend MPS 5 billion euros is still in doubt, and considered less likely. Hope is not dead, as there is still a chance that Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority, will lend MPS one billion euros, and that will encourage other investors to provide the other four.\n\nFailing that, Italy\u2019s government will have to bail out MPS. Under European Central Bank (ECB) rules that were imposed because of Greece\u2019s banking crisis, a government bailout of MPS would require a \u201cbail-in\u201d of MPS\u2019s bond holders.\n\nFor almost all banks, the bond holders are sophisticated investors who purchased bonds issued by the bank as an investment. But MPS is unique, in that thousands of ordinary people, including many elderly savers, who wanted to deposit their money in savings accounts instead were sold bank bonds by the bank\u2019s staff. The result is that a \u201cbail-in\u201d of supposedly sophisticated investors will actually cause tens of thousands of people to lose their life savings.\n\nMPS asked the ECB for a few more weeks\u2019 time to get the loans, but the request was rejected by the ECB. As a result, either MPS must get its loans this week, or else the new prime minister Paolo Gentiloni will have to authorize a government bailout by next weekend.

Add race to the mix, and we lose our collective minds. A dangerous mindset it is, and as it has affected a Virginia school district, leading to its decision to ban two American literary classics, I am compelled to weigh in. My experience as both an educator and a black American affords me a unique perspective.\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn are the latest victims of a\u00a0Coddle My Kid campaign sweeping the nation. One parent, concerned about the N-word prevalent in both books, made it her assignment to get the books removed from the Accomack County Public Schools. KIRO 7 reports:\n\n\nThe decision to remove The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain and To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee came after a parent filed a complaint. \u2026 The parent cited excessive racial slurs as the reason for wanting the books banned, Superintendent Warren Holland told the news station.\n\n\nShe lamented\u00a0the plethora of \"racial slurs in there and offensive wording\"\u2014 so much, she said, \"that you can\u2019t get past that.\" Her son was unable to stomach a particular Huckleberry Finn page because the N-word appeared seven times. The article goes on to relay that \"a racial slur appears 219 times in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and 48 times in To Kill a Mockingbird.\"\n\nDuring a career that spanned more than 17 years teaching English Language Arts, I taught To Kill a Mockingbird numerous times to countless students. I consider myself somewhat of an expert on the book, and I will defend till the end its place within our schools, homes, and even our churches\u2014N-word notwithstanding. It remains my favorite novel of all time.\n\nUnlike the worried mother, I am actually heartened by a son so intensely bothered by the word as it is used in the book. I submit that this, precisely, is the point. The purpose of education is not to shield from the uncomfortable, the hateful, or even the evil. On the contrary, it is to expose those very things to the light, discuss them, examine them, and commit not to repeat them.\n\nI do not worry that a student is disgusted that Tom Robinson is called a \"nigger\" by those who falsely accuse him of raping Mayella Ewell, a white woman. I do not worry that he\u00a0is\u00a0disgusted that Atticus's children are tormented by people calling their father a \"nigger-lover\" for defending Tom in court. I expect that. \n\nI worry when a student is not disgusted by those things. This parent should be proud that she is raising a son who was sickened by the treatment of Tom Robinson and by the verdict he received, for she clearly has done something right. Unfortunately, political correctness, unnecessary fear, or a need to control blinds her to that. She cannot see that he is supposed to be disgusted.\n\nHarper Lee uses the N-word in its historical context. Students understand that. Do we expect the people in Alabama in the thirties to speak in glowing terms of this man, under these circumstances? Would we bother reading if reality were sacrificed for the sake of feel-good fiction? No, we actually feel good when we read a story that is historically accurate, as ugly as it may be, and we can learn from that hi(s)tory. \n\nWhether it is pulling The Dukes of Hazzard off the air over the Confederate flag, renaming a school because George Washington owned slaves, or this banning of American literature so no one is uncomfortable, we are on a slippery slope of wiping out history and all its accompanying lessons. \n\nMy students loved To Kill a Mockingbird. As early\u00a0as\u00a0seventh grade, they appreciated the lessons embedded in its pages. I cannot count the times former students, years later, have told me how much they loved it, how it both entertained and challenged them, how it remains the greatest reading experience they ever had. Were some of these same students uncomfortable as I read the N-word\u2014without whispering it and often, purposefully, with fervor? Of course. But again, that\u2019s the point, and thus, a reason to rejoice, not recoil. I was never concerned about the students who were uncomfortable, only the ones who were not. And let's be honest: most young people hear blacks use the word nonchalantly with one another daily, as if it means \"friend\"\u2014throwing it around in a way that insults\u00a0its historical context. Now, that's something to get riled up about, but not many are willing to take up that particular battle.\n\nI have great respect for parents and their role in their children's education; they are the parents, after all. But I do challenge their thinking. Furthermore, I do not condone feeding students smut for the sake of consumption. I do, however, support exposing them to historically relevant, thought-provoking, and even painfully exhausting lessons that help mold them into adults equipped to influence their world for good. It's certainly preferred to turning out individuals who require canceled exams, therapy dogs, and cry-ins because they cannot handle reality.\n\nBelow is my Facebook Live reaction, recorded after both a former student and a friend posted the news of the banning on my timeline Thursday:\n\n\n\nAdrienne Ross is a Breitbart News editor, speaker, columnist, and author of #AuntAlma: Raisin' a Little (Hell) Heaven on Earth.

Join us to help fight.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Shannon Watts tweeted, \u201cOther nations protect their students. America gives dangerous people guns and asks students to defend themselves. God help us.\u201d When Twitter users called out Watts for seizing on a knife attack to push gun control, she responded by diminishing the danger of knife attacks versus firearm-based attacks, as\u00a0Breitbart News reported:\n\nLovely sentiment in light of Ohio State University tragedy today.

I'll scream bloody murder because that's what's happening to 100k shot annually in the US.\u201d\n\nThe next day, news reports were ubiquitous about how Abdul Razak Ali Artan drove a car into pedestrians on the OSU campus, then exited the vehicle and began slashing unarmed students with a butcher knife. Even in the face of these reports, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence issued a tweet urging Ohioans to continue fighting any change in law that would allow students with concealed carry permits to be armed on campus for self-defense.\n\nThe Brady Campaign tweeted:\n\nSay NO to guns in airports, daycares, college campuses & gov't buildings.

Rhetorical and physical manifestations of anti-Semitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.\"\n\nBut Gove has gone further, explicitly denouncing antizionism \u2013 opposition to the Jewish nation-state of Israel \u2013 as antisemitism.\n\n\"No other democracy is on the receiving end of a campaign calling for its people to be shunned and their labour to be blacklisted,\u201d Gove wrote in an article for The Times.\n\n\"This is antisemitism, impure and simple. It is the latest recrudescence of the age-old demand that the Jew can only live on terms set by others. Once Jews had to live in the ghetto, now they cannot live in their historic home.\"\n\nWhereas the official definition has been adopted as a means to stamp out hate crimes against Jewish people in Britain, Gove has chosen to highlight a wider problem with antisemitism on the political left in general, from the National Union of Students all the way up to the leader of Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nAnswering the perennial question: 'Why hatred against the Jews?' Gove wrote: \"For those on the left addicted to guilt-tripping and grievance-mongering, who believe that poverty is a consequence of western exploitation and that bourgeois ethics lead to oppression, the existence of a political entity that is a runaway success precisely because it is a bourgeois-minded, capitalist-fuelled, western-oriented nation state is just too much to bear. Their ideological prejudices have collided with a stubborn, undeniable, fact.\n\n\"So what do they do? Keep the prejudices, of course, and try to get rid of the fact. Try to undermine, delegitimise and reduce support for Israel. Make it the only country in the world whose right to exist is called continually into question.

We caution, however, that because President-elect Trump\u2019s meteoric rise was built on border security, we believe no other cabinet-level nominee will be under more pressure to produce.\nThe NBPC was proud to endorse President-elect Trump very early on, and we stood by him through thick and thin, and we continue to do so. However, our endorsement does come with expectations. We expect the new administration to work with the NBPC to solve the historic problems within the agency that have created an environment that consistently ranked at the bottom of all federal agencies in morale, job satisfaction, and trust in leadership. The challenge of meeting our expectations\u00a0and securing the border will be placed on the shoulders of General Kelly.\n\n\u201cGeneral Kelly's troops, by all accounts, loved him, which bodes well for the morale issue within DHS, and he appears to be a no-nonsense rule of law General,\u201d NBPC said, comparing Kelly to the nation\u2019s first\u00a0DHS Secretary, former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge. \u201cSecretary Ridge also had stellar credentials but due in large part to the newness of the department, and its size and breadth of work, he wasn\u2019t successful.\u201d\n\nUnder Ridge, foreign individuals from terrorist-friendly countries could still slip into the country post-9/11 due\u00a0to federal inaction and program loopholes, leading to criticisms that the newly founded DHS had already \u201csold out\u201d to multi-billion-dollar travel industry.\n\nRidge also told an audience in 2011 that deporting illegal aliens and upholding immigration laws, encouraging them to return home\u00a0and seek work elsewhere, was not an option.\n\n\u201cAt some point in time you\u2019ve got to say to yourself, \u2018We\u2019re not sending 12 million people home.\u2019 Let\u2019s get over it,\u201d he said at Georgetown University.\n\nBut only five years later, far from \u201cgetting over\u201d that millions of foreign nationals live and work in the U.S. in open defiance of the laws\u2014and\u00a0commit\u00a0heinous crimes\u2014Americans voted across the board to put a candidate in the White House who promised to enforce immigration laws on the books. That gives Kelly an advantage, the Council said.\n\nNBPC stated:\n\nUnlike Secretary Ridge, however, General Kelly will have history on his side, and if he comes in with a fresh approach\u2014the non-establishment \u201coutside of the box thinking\u201d approach\u2014and if he surrounds himself with the right people, we believe President-elect Trump\u2019s administration will allow him to be successful.\n\nNBPC represents approximately 17,000 border agents and gave its\u00a0first-ever presidential Primary endorsement to Trump after he pledged to model border security plans on the advice of agents on the ground, not remote political appointees.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump will take on special interest and embrace the ideas of rank-and-file Border Patrol agents rather than listening to the management yes-men who say whatever they are programmed to say.

The joke\u00a0\u2014 newly relevant thanks to the Brexit vote this year \u2014 has the added benefit of being fundamentally true.\n\n\n\nAnd so it is with Russia and the United States.\u00a0Russia has an interest in not getting along with the United States, which is going to frustrate any American administration, like it or not.\n\nAmerica\u2019s main interest overseas\u00a0is in maintaining liberal (small \u201cl\u201d) systems of trade, investment and navigation that allow American companies to flourish, and in spreading associated values of liberal (small \u201cl\u201d) democracy\u00a0that help keep the peace.\n\nRussia\u2019s main foreign policy interest is to overcome the geographic disadvantage of largely being\u00a0cut off from the Atlantic and Indian Oceans by maintaining a network of client states with better access to either. The liberal international order that the U.S. seeks to advance often threatens Russia\u2019s privileged relationship with those states.\n\nIn addition, the Russian government uses an aggressive foreign policy to bolster its domestic priorities. It is easier to argue for a more powerful central authority, and diminished civil liberties, when the country is ringed by enemies, real and imagined.\n\nThe old foreign policy adage holds that nations have no permanent friends or enemies \u2014 only permanent interests. Such is the case with Russia, which has a permanent interest in thwarting\u00a0the United States and opposing our liberalizing global aims.\n\nFor that reason, any U.S. foreign policy aiming primarily to forge a close friendship with Russia is probably going to fail. That was the case with President Barack Obama, who came to office believing the lingering tension in U.S.-Russian relations was entirely George W. Bush\u2019s fault. Together with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who offered Russia an infamous \u201creset\u201d button, Obama tried eagerly to appease\u00a0Russia \u2014 on missile defense, Syria, Iran, Ukraine, and much else besides.\n\nEven that wasn\u2019t enough to improve relations. Russian hacking and espionage\u00a0accelerated, and\u00a0Russia gave shelter to Edward Snowden after he exposed critical American national security secrets.\u00a0Still, the U.S. did little in response, other than to apply limited sanctions, and pathetic\u00a0complaints, in response to Russian aggression in the Ukraine. Indeed, when Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) proposed a plan\u00a0to punish Russia for its hacking and disinformation campaigns, the Obama administration rejected it.\n\nNow Obama has decided, in his lame duck days, to expel 35 Russian diplomats \u2014 purportedly for hacking during the U.S. election, and also \u2014 more credibly \u2014 for harassing American diplomats abroad. Whatever the merits of that response, the timing is highly questionable. Not only has Obama made repairing relations more difficult for his successor, but he has also tweaked a nation still in mourning after its ambassador to Turkey was brutally murdered at a public event earlier this month.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has proposed to repair relations with Russia, partly by toning down criticism of President Vladimir Putin.\n\nOn the one hand, there is no reason to believe any president could succeed in achieving close ties with Russia for the simple reason that its permanent interests are opposed to our own. On the other hand, there is an area of common interest with Russia that could provide the basis for better, less confrontational relations, even with areas of disagreement.\n\nThat area of common interest is the fight against radical Islamic terrorism. Under Obama, cooperation with Russia has been weak in that area, largely because Obama refuses to acknowledge that radical Islamic terrorism exists. Russia reportedly tried to warn the Obama administration about the Boston Marathon bombers, but that intelligence was ignored. Trump proposes to work together with Russia against ISIS, setting aside the thorny Syria issue, even if stark differences over other issues\u00a0persist.\n\nThe one area of concern is Eastern Europe, where Russia has been saber-rattling for years, and where hawkish Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and John McCcain (R-AZ) are on a solidarity tour.\u00a0But Putin is unlikely to test Trump in Eastern Europe. He knows Trump\u2019s approach to foreign policy, as on other issues, is to be nice at first, but to retaliate in overwhelming fashion if crossed. Putin won\u2019t risk that confrontation \u2014 rather, he will pocket his gains in Ukraine and the Middle East, for now.\n\nThe Crimea is unlikely to revert to Ukraine \u2014 and that is indeed unfortunate. But that happened squarely on Obama\u2019s watch. One of the more garish aspects of Obama\u2019s foreign policy is that he is doing more in response to the\u00a0hacking of his party\u2019s emails than he did to protect the territorial integrity\u00a0of a friendly nation.\n\nNow Obama, who built his career on pointing out the intelligence mistakes of the Iraq War, wants to rush into a dubious cyberwar with Russia.\n\nAnd they say Trump is scary?\n\nJoel B.

They do not have a clear reason why he decided to change his one-way trip, though they suspect that \u201cthe highly visible presence of NYPD officers throughout the city on New Year's Eve could have been an effective deterrent.\u201d There is no evidence that\u00a0Santiago went beyond buying the plane ticket, such as arranging for lodging. He did not appear to book lodging in Florida, either, though he has family in the area.\n\nOlder brother Bryan Santiago told the\u00a0Orlando Sun-Sentinel that Esteban Santiago has a half-brother in Naples, Florida, due west of Fort Lauderdale, and that the two had spoken shortly before the attack.\u00a0\u201cHe called my older brother, and my brother told him \u2018Come to Naples anytime you want. There is always a place for you to stay with me,'\u201d\u00a0Bryan Santiago said.\n\nThe FBI has yet to confirm a motive for Santiago\u2019s attack. On Saturday, the FBI special agent in charge of the investigation, George Piro, told reporters that they had not found any evidence that Santiago had been consuming jihadist content on social media. \u201cWe're looking over all of his social media, things like that. It's giving us a picture of the individual, but it's way too early for us to rule out anything,\u201d Piro said.\n\nSantiago had mentioned the Islamic State to authorities before the attack, however. In November, Santiago visited the FBI offices in Anchorage, Alaska, where he had been living, to declare that the U.S. government was forcing him to watch Islamic State videos and fight for the Islamic State. The FBI confiscated his registered firearm and, after\u00a0a psychological evaluation, eventually returned it. Police have not confirmed whether this weapon was the one used in the attack.\n\nAside from the Islamic State references to the FBI, few leads appear to indicate that Santiago was a radicalized terrorist. Alaska\u2019s only mosque, the Islamic Community Center of Alaska, told the\u00a0Miami Herald\u00a0it has \u201cno connection with this guy whatsoever,\u201d and no witnesses have claimed Santiago ever attended the mosque or spoke of Islam to them. Bryan Santiago told the\u00a0Sun-Sentinel Santiago has \u201cnever been a Muslim. He\u2019s always been a Christian,\u201d and that the\u00a0keffiyeh scarf he is seen wearing in a photo circulating online was a \u201csouvenir he bought in Iraq when he was serving in the military.\u201d\n\nBryan Santiago did confirm that his brother had confided in him about his concerns regarding the CIA. \u201cHe started talking to me, you know, that he\u2019s seeing \u2026\u00a0weird things, that he\u2019s hearing voices, that the government is using him \u2026 that the CIA is sending him secret codes to his laptop, and that he don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d Bryan Santiago said he told his brother to \u201cgo to the church or to psychologist or something.\u201d\n\nSantiago served nearly a decade in the U.S. armed forces, first in the Puerto Rico National Guard and then the\u00a0Alaska National Guard. He was deployed to Iraq in 2010, reportedly diffusing\u00a0improvised explosive devices, and two of his company were killed in that deployment.\n\nMultiple relatives have told various news outlets that his deployment to Iraq appeared to change him. Ex-girlfriend Michelle Qui\u00f1ones told ABC News that Santiago sought help from the Department of Veterans Affairs following his return from Iraq in 2011.\u00a0\"We had let veterans know that he was having some mental problems, that he wasn\u2019t feeling alright and they did nothing,\" she asserted.\n\nSantiago is facing the death penalty for the mass murder he allegedly committed on Friday, and is currently being held on suicide watch. With no more than $10 in his bank accounts, Santiago cannot afford a lawyer, and the government has provided public legal counsel.\n\nHis family hopes to save him from capital punishment given years of apparent mental illness. \u201cWe are struggling to prove that he had mental problems, that he communicated them and asked authorities for help, and due to that these criminal charges are not viable,\u201d Brian Santiago told the Spanish-language\u00a0Primera Hora.

Schumer described Garland as \u201ca very moderate, mainstream nominee.\u201d The GOP said it would be up to the next president to nominate the ninth judge to the nation\u2019s highest court.\n\nPreviously, Heritage Action CEO Michael A. Needham said:\n\nPresident Obama and Senate Democrats will no doubt call Judge Garland a \u2018mainstream Federal judge\u2019 and promise his \u2018approach to deciding cases on the law and the Constitution, not politics or an ideological agenda.'\u201d He added, \u201cOf course, they said those exact words when liberal Justices Sotomayor and Kagan were nominated. We are one liberal Justice away from seeing gun rights restricted and partial birth abortion being considered a constitutional right. The Republican majority exists to block these type of nominees.\n\nSimilarly, Manhattan Institute Senior Fellow James Copland said, \u201cJudge Garland is an experienced, highly regarded judge\u2014who happens to be a liberal. In other words, he looks a lot like Samuel Alito did when he was nominated by George W. Bush, except that Alito was a conservative rather than a liberal.\u201d Copland added, \u201cIt\u2019s hardly surprising that GOP senators, now in the majority, would approach this nomination similarly.\u201d\n\nGarland\u2019s nomination expired Tuesday with the swearing in of the\u00a0115th Congress.\n\nBreitbart News previously reported that in 2007, Schumer told an audience at the left-wing American Constitution Society (ACS) that he wanted to block any Supreme Court nominations for the last 18 months of President George W. Bush\u2019s presidency.\n\nHowever, earlier this year\u00a0Schumer said Republicans should not cite his 2007 comments, saying it is \u201ccomparing apples to oranges.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with Maddow, Schumer said, \u201cThey won\u2019t have 60 votes to put in and out of the mainstream nominee. And then they\u2019re going to have to make a choice; change the rules. It\u2019s going to be very hard for them to change the rules.\u201d\n\nBack in 2013,\u00a0Senate Democrats\u00a0did change the rules by triggering\u00a0the \u201cnuclear option\u201c\u00a0to decrease the number of senators needed to confirm Cabinet picks from 60 to 51 votes. Schumer, who had argued against the move which was brought about by former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid (D-NV), said he wishes \u201cit hadn\u2019t happened.\u201d\n\nSchumer and his fellow Democratic senators have vowed to fight against eight of President-elect Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks. Republicans hold a 52-48 majority in the new Senate which means they already have\u00a0the number needed to confirm Trump\u2019s nominees without the Democrats.\n\nFollow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope\u00a0@AdelleNaz", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.48622366786003096, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 552, "FairnessVirtue": 4, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.49931113659, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170105180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.8985507246376803, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/01/27/elizabeth-warren-fails-to-disclose-1-3-million-line-of-credit/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [90, 1822, 2064]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 925, "scraper_regex": 1019}}, "headline": "Elizabeth Warren Fails to Disclose $1.3 Million Line of Credit", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1019, "date": "20170128030000", "story_content": "Sen.

For two years in a row, Warren failed to list it on the financial disclosure form all senators complete each year,\u201d he continued, adding:\n\nThe purpose of the line of credit remains murky, and Warren's staff claims she is not required by law to report it. But that hasn't stopped the Massachusetts Democrat from hypocritically demanding the highest levels of ethics from President Trump's Cabinet appointees.

Pence. \u201cWe hope to be in a position to do that once again.\u201d\n\nAlthough Republicans control the body, 52-to-46 with two Independents caucusing with Democrats, such a close margin sets up a dynamic whereby any three GOP senators have enormous leverage, with the ability to hand a victory to the Democrats.\n\nThe new leader of Senate Democrats, Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D.-N.Y.), is looking to confront the new president and the Republicans on many fronts, including eight Trump nominees, the vacancy on the Supreme Court, and the unwinding of President Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare reform legislation, the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nSchumer added in a statement to The Washington Post confirming his caucus's plans:\n\nAny attempt by Republicans to have a series of rushed, truncated hearings before Inauguration Day and before the Congress and public have adequate information on all of them is something Democrats will vehemently resist. If Republicans think they can quickly jam through a whole slate of nominees without a fair hearing process, they're sorely mistaken.\n\nThe eight nominees targeted by Senate Democrats are: Steven Mnuchin, Treasury; Rep. Thomas Price (R.-Ga.), Health and Human Services; Sen. Jeff Sessions (R.-Ala.), Justice; Elizabeth DeVos, Education; Rex Tillerson, State; Rep. J. Michael \u201cMick\u201d Mulvaney (R.-S.C.), Office of Management and Budget; Scott Pruitt, Environmental Protection Agency; and Andrew Puzder, Labor.\n\nOf the eight targets, Senate Democrats will have the toughest time opposing Sessions on a personal level. Not only is the Alabama senator highly qualified as a former federal prosecutor and his own state\u2019s attorney general, he is also personally popular with his colleagues \u2014 colleagues who loathe to vote against a fellow senator.\n\nIt is the custom for nominees for federal office to be \u201cintroduced\u201d by the senators from their home state, who vouch for the nominee. Sessions is scheduled to be introduced by his Alabama partner Sen. Richard Shelby (R.-Ala.) and Sen. Susan Collins (R.-Maine). Collins is one of the three most liberal Republicans in the Senate and nearly always the one Republican voting with Democrats. Having Collins vouch for Sessions signals Democrats there will be no defections over Sessions.\n\nIt is expected to be smooth sailing for retired Marine Gen. James N. Mattis, Defense; Dr. Benjamin Carson, Housing and Urban Development; South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, U.S. Mission to the United Nations; retired Marine Gen. John F. Kelly, Homeland Security; Wilbur Ross, Commerce; and Elaine Chao, Transportation.\n\nMattis retired in 2013, after serving as the commanding general of U.S. Central Command, which oversees all of the Middle East and Egypt and is the next higher headquarters for theater commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan\u2013two theaters, where Mattis led Marines in close combat, including the first battle for Fallujah.\n\nAlthough Mattis enjoyed near-universal acclaim, his confirmation requires a legislative waiver to the National Security Act, which requires a seven-year gap between becoming secretary of defense and leaving uniformed service. The rule was put in place to guarantee civilian control of the military.\n\nNo one on Capitol Hill thought the waiver would be contested until Sen. John S. McCain III (R.-Ariz.) scheduled a hearing Monday for the Senate Armed Services Committee he chairs\u2013focused on preserving civilian control of the military.\n\nWhen Mattis\u2019s nomination was announced, McCain was very supportive and said he would write the waiver legislation personally.\n\n\u201cHe is without a doubt one of the finest military officers of his generation and an extraordinary leader who inspires a rare and special admiration of his troops,\u201d he said. \u201cGeneral Mattis has a clear understanding of the many challenges facing the Department of Defense, the U.S. military, and our national security. America will be fortunate to have General Mattis in its service once again.\u201d\n\nThat was then. Now the buzz on Capitol Hill is that unless Trump lines up with McCain to support the intelligence community and the intelligence community\u2019s narrative that the Russians hacked the 2016 election, McCain will join Democrats in delaying conformations.\n\nTo their chagrin, Democrats made things easier for Trump and the Republicans \u2014 by making life easier for Obama. In 2011, they passed a law exempting 200 presidential appointments from Senate confirmation. Then, in 2013, Senate Democrats changed the chamber\u2019s rules to remove the 60-vote threshold for ending debate on nominations other than for the Supreme Court.\n\nEach Senate committee schedules hearings and votes on confirmations independently.\n\nTuesday Jan. 10Sen.

We submitted the questions to her under a\u00a0court order\u00a0issued by U.S. District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan on August 19, 2016.\n\nIn our brief, we argue that Clinton \"failed to provide sufficient reasons for refusing to answer them, and the limited reasons she provides do not warrant sustaining her objections.\" Hillary Clinton refused outright to answer questions about the creation of her email system, her decision to use the system despite warning from State Department officials, and the basis for her claim that the State Department had \"90-95 percent\" of her emails.\n\nIn her\u00a0responses\u00a0sent to Judicial Watch and the court on October 13, 2016, Clinton refused to answer these three questions outright and responded 20 times that she \"does not recall\" information concerning her non-government clintonemail.com email system.\u00a0She preceded her responses by eight \"general objections\" and two \"objections to definitions.\"\u00a0The words \"object\" or \"objection\" appear 84 times throughout the 23-page document submitted to the court and Judicial Watch.\n\nIn our motion to compel her to answer, we argue:\n\nPursuant to Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \"The grounds for objecting to an interrogatory must be stated with specificity. \u2026 In addition, the party objecting to the interrogatory bears the burden of 'show[ing] why discovery should not be permitted. \u2026'\" Although she objected to the three interrogatories, Secretary Clinton failed to provide sufficient reasons for refusing to answer them, and the limited reasons she provides do not warrant sustaining her objections.\n\nInterrogatory 1 asks: \"Describe the creation of the clintonemail.com system, including who decided to create the system, the date it was decided to create the system, why it was created, who set it up, and when it became operational.\" In our motion to compel, we argue:\n\nSecretary Clinton objects and asserts that the interrogatory is outside the scope of permitted discovery. \u2026 However, the creation of the clintonemail.com system is squarely within the scope of permitted discovery.\u00a0 Understanding the basic facts surrounding the creation of the system is an integral part of understanding how and why it came to be used for State Department business.\u00a0 To date, no witness has testified about these facts, and the Court specifically authorized interrogatories to enable Plaintiff to gather this information. Secretary Clinton's refusal to answer the interrogatory is therefore misplaced.\n\nInterrogatory 14 asks:\n\nOn March 6, 2009, Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security Eric J. Boswell wrote in an Information Memo to your Chief of Staff, Cheryl Mills, that he \"cannot stress too strongly, however, that any unclassified BlackBerry is highly vulnerable in any setting to remotely and covertly monitoring conversations, retrieving email, and exploiting calendars.\" A March 11, 2009, email states that, in a management meeting with the assistant secretaries, you approached Assistant Secretary Boswell and mentioned that you had read the \"IM\" and that you \"get it.\" Did you review the March 6, 2009, Information Memo, and, if so, why did you continue using an unclassified BlackBerry to access your clintonemail.com email account to conduct official State Department business?\n\nSecretary Clinton objected to Interrogatory 14, asserting that it concerned \"cybersecurity issues outside the scope of permitted discovery.\" In our motion to compel, we argue:\n\nInterrogatory 14 does not concern \"cybersecurity issues.\"\u00a0It asks whether Secretary Clinton read a memorandum about the general use of unapproved or unclassified Blackberries, and, if she did read the memorandum, why did she continue using an unapproved or unclassified Blackberry \u2013 the device by which [she] accessed the clintonemail.com account she used to conduct official government business. A yes or no answer to whether she read the memorandum will not reveal any information the parties' agreed-upon scope sought to avoid.\u00a0Similarly, if the answer is yes, Secretary Clinton's explanation as to why, after reading the memorandum, she continued to access her clintonemail.com account through her Blackberry also will not reveal any information the parties' agreed-upon scope sought to avoid. The interrogatory clearly seeks information squarely within the scope of permitted discovery. Secretary Clinton should be compelled to answer Interrogatory 14.\n\nInterrogatory 24 asks:\n\nDuring your October 22, 2015 appearance before the U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on Benghazi, you testified that 90 to 95 percent of your emails \"were in the State's system\" and \u201cif they wanted to see them, they would certainly have been able to do so.\u201d Identify the basis for this statement, including all facts on which you relied in support of the statement, how and when you became aware of these facts, and, if you were made aware of these facts by or through another person, identify the person who made you aware of these facts.\n\nSecretary Clinton objected to Interrogatory 24 and asserted that the interrogatory asked for information protected by the attorney-client privilege. In our motion to compel, we argue:\n\nInterrogatory 24 does not seek any factual information Secretary Clinton may have provided to her attorneys in confidence for purposes of obtaining legal advice.\u00a0 Nor does it seek any advice Secretary Clinton's attorneys may have provided the secretary that would reveal facts she provided them in confidence.\u00a0 The interrogatory only seeks the factual basis for a specific representation Secretary Clinton made to Congress.\u00a0 It is irrelevant whether Secretary Clinton told her attorneys about the factual basis for this representation, either for purposes of obtaining legal advice or for some other purpose, because Plaintiff has not asked about any such communications.\u00a0 As a result, the attorney client privilege does not apply.\n***\nBecause Secretary Clinton has failed to provide any such information to justify her assertion of the attorney client privilege, she should be compelled to answer Interrogatory 24.\n\nBy refusing to answer our simple questions, Hillary Clinton is obstructing Judicial Watch's efforts to get basic information about her email practices.\u00a0Because she has not \u2013 and cannot \u2013 demonstrate that her refusal to answer our questions is proper, Hillary Clinton should be required by the court to answer them promptly.\n\nThe Clinton responses to interrogatives were received in the Judicial Watch Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which was first filed in September 2013 seeking records about the controversial employment status of Huma Abedin, former deputy chief of staff to Clinton (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of State\u00a0(No. 1:13-cv-01363)). The\u00a0lawsuit was reopened\u00a0because of revelations about the clintonemail.com system.\n\nIn the same cases we also filed another Motion to Compel against John Bentel, former State Department director of Information Resource Management of the Executive Secretariat, to answer 87 questions asked of him during his October 24 Judicial Watch deposition concerning former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's non-state.gov email system. At the\u00a0deposition, Bentel answered each of the questions, \"On advice from my legal counsel, I decline to answer the question and I invoke my Fifth Amendment rights.\" Judicial Watch's court filing refutes Bentel's claim for Fifth Amendment self-incrimination protection, arguing:\n\nMr. Bentel has invoked his Fifth Amendment rights without providing any justification whatsoever. He has not identified \u2013 let alone demonstrated \u2013 a fear of prosecution in answering any of the 87 questions asked of him during his deposition. Nor has he demonstrated any such fear is more than fanciful or merely speculative. Mr. Bentel has not provided Plaintiff or the Court with any pertinent information to allow it to assess the validity of the invocation for each of the 87 questions Mr. Bentel declined to answer.\n\nJudge Sullivan allowed us to depose Bentel in the first place, in part, because of his notable appearance in a May 2016\u00a0Inspector General's report\u00a0that found:\n\nMr. Bentel told employees in his office that Secretary Clinton's email arrangement had been approved by the State Department's legal staff and also instructed his subordinates not to discuss the Secretary's email again:\nIn one meeting, one staff member raised concerns that information sent and received on Secretary Clinton's account could contain Federal records that needed to be preserved in order to satisfy Federal recordkeeping requirements. According to the staff member, the Director stated that the Secretary's personal system had been reviewed and approved by Department legal staff and that the matter was not to be discussed any further. \u2026 According to the other S/ES-IRM staff member who raised concerns about the server, the Director stated that the mission of S/ES-IRM is to support the Secretary and instructed the staff never to speak of the Secretary's personal email system again.\n\nIt should disturb Americans that yet another Clinton IT official asserted the Fifth Amendment rather than answer straight-forward questions about Clinton's email scheme. You can see why this Clinton email scandal will continue for long time, though\u00a0Election Day has passed.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.1303257942199703, "HarmVice": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1435, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 10, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.99586491878, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161109170000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 6, "pct_mft_words": 1.8815331010453, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/11/12/lat-8000-anti-trump-protesters-march-los-angeles/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1507, 2074, 2102, 2252, 2597, 3285, 4318, 4329, 6481]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 823, "scraper_regex": 974}}, "headline": "LA Times: 8,000 Anti-Trump Protesters March in Los Angeles", "wordcount_as_scraped": 974, "date": "20161113030000", "story_content": "An estimated 8,000 people marched in what the Los Angeles Times characterized as \"emotional\" but peaceful protest against the election of President-elect Donald J.

In fact, a study of the rule suggests that at least one-third of America's remaining coal jobs could be put at risk due to the restrictive nature of the rule.\n\nThe president has certainly chosen one heck of a last-minute Christmas present. The rule will actually take effect exactly one day before Donald Trump's inauguration\u2014thereby imposing a very late obstacle to the new administration\u2019s quest to craft a more pragmatic energy policy.\n\nThe full text of the new regulation clocks roughly 1,640 pages. And despite OSM's legal obligation to consult with state agencies, the final rule was drafted without the input of key mining states. What's particularly troubling is that the regulation simply duplicates the existing oversight already being conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and various states agencies.\n\nSignificantly, the actual language being proffered by OSM suggests that the minutiae of the rule is happily intended to kill off the nation's coal industry. OSM says the rule will \"result in the protection or restoration of 22 miles of intermittent and perennial streams per year.\" Essentially, the rule bans mining within 100 feet of these streams, which establishes a fairly broad mandate since intermittent streams are one of the typical features of almost every wooded area in North America.\n\nHowever, green activists like to vilify coal as a \"dirty\" fuel. But this overlooks the fact that America's coal-fired power plants are now 90% cleaner than 30 years ago, thanks to the 15 different high-tech mechanisms that trap power plant emissions. And America's mining companies are already legally required to reclaim the land surrounding mining sites, a task for which they've readily invested billions of dollars in recent years.\n\nThe supposition, though, is that coal companies simply want to make money\u2014with no thought to the \"greater good.\" But America has gained much from the extraction of coal, including the affordable power that has long supported safe, first-world living, modern sanitation, and an industrial sector driven by robust electricity generation.\n\nAnd so, the real question is whether such a redundant new \"stream rule\" is even necessary. Not when U.S. mining companies are already working diligently to eliminate offsite impacts under the watchful scrutiny of both state and federal agencies.\n\nThe U.S. coal industry has lost 68,000 good-paying, middle class jobs in recent years. The new stream rule could boost that toll by potentially tens of thousands of jobs.

We are investing a great deal of diplomatic efforts in this, and this also has to be your main efforts in the coming days,\" Netanyahu said. \"This will not take much time, but it will occupy us in the next two weeks, and we need to succeed.\"\n\nNetanyahu's remarks seem to confirm a Breitbart Jerusalem exclusive report from last week quoting a senior PA official as saying that the conclusions reached at the Paris Mideast summit could form the basis of UN action prior to Obama's departure from office.\n\nThe official said the UN action could come in the form of declarations by UN bodies, including the General Assembly; UN sessions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; or even another United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolution.\u00a0 He said any further UNSC resolution would depend on the support of the U.S. and European countries after the Paris Mideast summit.\n\nHe said the UN action would seek to set\u00a0the parameters of a future Palestinian state with a clear timeline for negotiations.\u00a0 If the action comes in the form of a resolution at a UN body, it\u00a0could call for an infrastructure to establish mechanisms to enforce the UNSC resolution two weeks ago, which demanded a complete halt to\u00a0Israeli construction in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem and declared those territories occupied Palestinian lands, the Palestinian official said.\n\nThe PA official speaking to Breitbart Jerusalem\u00a0said that any upcoming UN action would be geared\u00a0toward bypassing the Mideast policies of the incoming Donald Trump administration by establishing binding guidelines for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and a halt to settlement activity.\n\n\u201cThe new motion will seek to set up a clear timeline for negotiations resulting in the establishment of a Palestinian state and stipulate a procedure for overseeing the implementation of Resolution 2334, including posting inspectors to the Palestinian territories,\" said the PA official, who requested anonymity.\n\nHe said the \"inspectors\" are expected to be civilians with a background in security, and would function like the Temporary International Presence mission in Hebron.\u00a0 That mission consists of civilian observers who monitor the so-called Hebron Agreement, which saw the partial redeployment of Israeli forces to sections of Hebron while about 80% of the territory remained under Palestinian control.\n\nThe PA official added that the Paris conference is expected to call on all sides to establish a Palestinian state within the so-called 1967 borders in a relatively short period of time, perhaps by the beginning of 2019.\n\n\u201cThe goal is for these moves to be binding for the incoming American administration, which would have to adopt them as its platform, and also for the European Union, which is expected to step up should there be clashes with Trump,\" he said.\n\n\u201cIn the next few days we\u2019ll know whether we\u2019re headed to the UNSC,\u201d the official said. \u201cRight now, the chances of that are very high. From our viewpoint, the goal is partially achieved. The settlements have been designated as the main obstacle to the peace process and now it\u2019s up for the world to make clear that, in the event of failure, the side that would refuse to comply with the will of the international community, as codified in the UN resolution, is the guilty side.\u201d\n\nThe official said that it remains unclear whether any UNSC session would produce a new resolution or merely validate last week's resolution.\n\n\u201cFollowing in the EU\u2019s steps, now the US recognizes that it\u2019s Israel that sabotages the peace talks, and does so through its settlement enterprise,\" the official claimed. \"The motion is of immense significance \u2013 it validates all the decisions by the international community, chiefly the EU, to slap sanctions on Israel in the form of halting cooperation, halting the financing of mutual projects and expansion in scope of marking settlement products to all the products from every single settlement.\u201d\n\nLast week, Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said that the U.S. would veto any other UNSC resolution brought before Obama leaves office if the text of the resolution is anti-Israel.\u00a0 The \"anti-Israel\" qualifier is left open for interpretation.\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

The group, an offshoot of\u00a0the Moro Liberation groups, specializes in abducting Westerners for ransom\u00a0and made $7 million in profit in ransoms in the first six months of 2016. To cut the flow of assets to the terrorist group, Duterte recently pledged not to attempt to rescue its hostages, warning Filipinos to avoid dangerous areas and not rely on ransom payments to come.\n\nDuterte, who is from southern Mindanao, has previously warned that the Islamic State has been growing increasingly popular in his country, and the battle has become extremely personal for him.\u00a0To be frank, I have cousins on the other side, with MI [Moro Islamic Liberation Front] and MN [Moro National Liberation Front].

Bush.\n\nThe White House spokesman attributed the low percentage of re-engagements under Obama to the president's multi-agency parole-style panel, known as the Periodic Review Board (PRB), that has cleared for release all the prisoners transferred out after 2009, including so-called \"forever prisoners,\" or those believed to be too dangerous to release.\n\n\"Since President Obama took office, and since these reforms were initiated, nine detainees have been confirmed by the intelligence community of reengaging in the fight,\" Earnest said on Thursday. \"Considering that we have released 183 detainees during President Obama's time in office, a little back-of-the-envelope math would indicate that our percentage is much better, and it's a result of the reforms that President Obama instituted on his first day in office.\"\n\nAccording to ODNI, 20 out of 161 detainees (12 percent) had been confirmed (nine) or suspected (11) to have returned to terrorist activities under Obama's watch as of July 2016.\n\nUnder the Bush administration, 188 out of 532 (35 percent) are confirmed (113) or suspected (75) to have re-engaged in terrorism.\n\nWhen taken as a whole, if there were 20 detainees confirmed or suspected to have re-engaged in terrorism for every 161 detainees released under Bush like during the Obama administration, the overall rate of terror returnees before 2009 would be closer to 40 percent, not 35.\n\nIn late December, the Chicago Tribune, citing U.S. officials, reported that the Obama administration has shared its plans with Congress to transfer out as many as 19 detainees held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.\n\nOf the 55 prisoners still held at Gitmo, 18 have been cleared for release by Obama's PRB and more than half (27) are considered \"forever prisoners,\" or too dangerous to release.\n\nNevertheless, Obama has already released prisoners who had been designated too dangerous to release.\n\nThe remaining 10 prisoners are believed to still be undergoing war crimes proceedings at military commissions, including at least six who were facing death penalty tribunals as of late last year.\n\nOn Friday, the Pentagon announced that four detainees \u2013 Salem Ahmad Hadi Bin Kanad, Muhammed Rajab Sadiq Abu Ghanim, Abdallah Yahya Yusif Al-Shibli, and Muhammad Ali Abdallah Muhammad Bwazir \u2013 had been transferred to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\nAll four detainees are from war-ravaged Yemen, which shares a border with Saudi Arabia.\n\nAt least two individuals \u2014 Kanad and Ghanim\u00a0\u2014 had been linked to the Taliban when they were apprehended and taken to the Guant\u00e1namo prison, also known as Gitmo.\n\nMeanwhile, the al-Qaeda-linked\u00a0Bwazir has been directly linked to Osama bin Laden.\n\nAl-Shibli, also affiliated with al-Qaeda, was born in Saudi Arabia, but is a citizen of Yemen, according to the U.S. military.\n\nIn December 2007, the U.S. military deemed him \"a HIGH risk, as he is likely to pose a threat to the US, its interests and allies.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.65832424163818, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 829, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.2295126669700003, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 17, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170108020000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.05066344993969, "mft_mean": 1.54545454545}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/abortion/2016/11/29/pro-life-leaders-applaud-choice-rep-tom-price-hhs-nominee/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [854, 2768, 4083]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 687, "scraper_regex": 813}}, "headline": "Pro-Life Leaders Applaud Choice of Rep.

Trump seems absolutely committed to honoring his pro-life commitments by selecting a man with a 100% pro-life record\u2026And in choosing a pro-life cabinet member, Trump has disrupted the liberal media\u2019s pro-abortion agenda, their single most important issue.\n\nSusan B. Anthony List president Marjorie Dannenfelser also commented:\n\nRepresentative Tom Price is an excellent choice for Secretary of Health and Human Services. He has a 100 percent pro-life record and is well positioned to champion truly comprehensive health care. He helped lead the charge to defund Planned Parenthood through budget reconciliation, setting the stage for President-elect Trump and a pro-life Congress to reallocate those funds to support comprehensive women\u2019s healthcare. As HHS Secretary, he will play a key role in developing a robust health care reform proposal that protects life and consciences, while promoting options for low-income individuals and families.\n\nSimilarly, Ashley McGuire, senior fellow with The Catholic Association, released the following statement:\n\nPresident-elect Trump has made an excellent choice in Rep. Price as Secretary of HHS. In particular, Rep. Price\u2019s strong pro-life values and record to match make him the right man to reform an agency that has been marred by its aggressive abortion agenda. The Department of HHS caused the largest religious liberty class-action lawsuit in American history when it tried to force religious employers and charities like the Little Sisters of the Poor to pay for and provide things like abortion pills in their healthcare plans.\u00a0We are confident that Rep. Price will finally put an end to the anti-religious liberty HHS mandate, as well as introduce comprehensive reforms to restore the agency as one that genuinely promotes healthcare that respects human life and dignity.\n\nAbortion chain Planned Parenthood and its CEO Cecile Richards, however, are denouncing the choice.\n\nOur nation's HHS Secretary should aim to break down barriers to health care.

His\u00a0positions stand to take women back decades.\nWe see a disturbing trend in Trump's administration: Its leadership is shaping up to be anti-abortion, and it's antithetical to everything Planned Parenthood and its supporters stand for.

The horribly bad news for Yahoo followed an equally bad news report in September that 500 million e-mail account were hacked in 2013. Yahoo unfortunately now has the distinction of suffering both of the history's largest client hacks.\n\nVerizon's top lawyer told reporters after the first Yahoo hack that the disclosure constituted a \"potential material adverse event\" that would allow for the mobile powerhouse to pull out of the $4.83 billion deal they announced on July 25, 2016.\n\nLess than 24 hours after Yahoo\u00a0disclosed\u00a0the even larger hack of client accounts by a \"state-sponsored actor,\" Bloomberg\u00a0reported that Verizon is \"exploring a price cut or possible exit\" from its proposed Yahoo acquisition.\n\nBreitbart reported that Google and other Silicon Valley companies were huge corporate winners when Chairman Tom Wheeler and the other two Democrat political appointees on the FCC voted on a party-line vote in mid-February 2015 for a new regulatory structure called 'Net Neutrality.' Although Wheeler claimed,\u00a0\"These enforceable, bright-line rules will ban paid prioritization, and the blocking and throttling of lawful content and services,\" they were a huge economic disaster for Verizon's high-speed broadband business model.\n\nVerizon responded last year by paying $4.4 billion to buy AOL in order to pick up popular news sites, large advertising business, and more than 2 million Internet dial-up subscribers. Buying Yahoo was expected to give the former telephone company to achieve \"scale\" by controlling a second web content pioneer.\n\nAfter President and CEO Marissa Mayer began organizing an auction in March, Yahoo stock doubled from $26 a share to $51 by September. But she announced on Wednesday the new hack, Yahoo's stock has been plunging to $38.40 in after-market trading.\n\nThe buyer normally has to pay a break-up fee if an acquisition fails. But Yahoo chose to run its own auction that \"communicated with a total of 51 parties to evaluate their interest in a potential transaction.\" Then between February and April 2016, a \"short list\" of \"32 parties signed confidentiality agreements with Yahoo,\" including 10 strategic parties and 22 financial sponsors.\n\nYahoo's 13D proxy statement filed with the SEC was mostly boilerplate disclosure, but it seemed that something must have been a potential problem at Yahoo for the company to offer a $145 million termination fee to Verizon if the deal did not close.\n\nYahoo on Wednesday issued a statement saying personal information from more than a billion user accounts was stolen in 2014. The news followed the company's announcement in September that hackers had stolen personal data from at least half a billion accounts in 2013. Yahoo said it believes the two thefts were by different parties.\n\nYahoo admitted that both hacks were so extensive that they included users' names, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, scrambled passwords and security questions and answers. But Yahoo stated, \"Payment card data and bank account information are not stored in the system the company believes was affected.\"\n\nYahoo said they have invalidated unencrypted security questions and answers in user accounts. They are in the process of notifying potentially affected users and is requiring them to change their passwords.\n\nYahoo was already facing nearly two dozen class-action lawsuits over the first breach and the company's failure to report it on a timely basis. A federal 3 judge panel last week consolidated 5 of the suits into a mass tort in the San Jose U.S. District Court.\n\nUndoubtedly, there will be a huge number of user lawsuits filed against Yahoo in the next few weeks.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 0, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.62008738517761, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 609, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.02851895445, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 3, "mft_sum": 9, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161217040000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.47783251231527, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.8181818181820001}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/31/immigration-2015-one-immigrants-two-new-workers/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [167, 878, 880, 1519, 2153, 5870, 6104, 6413, 6416, 6419]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 757, "scraper_regex": 1012}}, "headline": "Report: One new Immigrant for Every two U.S. Births in 2015", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1012, "date": "20161101060000", "story_content": "New government data shows 1.6 million legal and illegal immigrants settled in the United States during 2014,\u00a0up 40 percent since President Barack Obama was inaugurated in 2009.\n\nThe government data, which was publicized by the Center for Immigration Studies, also showed 914,000 immigrants in the first six months of 2015, putting the nation on track to accept almost 2 million immigrants in just one year.\n\nThe almost 2 million 2015 migrants arrived as almost 4 million Americans were born, and as almost 4 million American graduates turned 18 and began looking for jobs in a sluggish economy. That\u2019s roughly one new immigrant, legal and illegal, for every two Americans who began looking for a job in 2015.\n\nIn addition, almost 9 percent of all babies born in the United States during 2013 \u2014 or roughly 300,000 babies\u00a0\u2014\u00a0were birthed by illegal immigrants. If those births are discounted, the likely 2015 inflow of migrants was very close to one immigrant for every two births to American parents.\n\nIn 2014, the inflow of 1.6 million migrants added up to two new immigrants for every five births or every five new graduates.\n\nThat huge inflow of migrants in 2014 and 2015 effectively increased the annual supply of new workers by almost 50 percent. That\u2019s great for employers, good news for retailers, and also for Wall Street\u2019s investors, but is bad news for Americans\u2019 wages, bad news for lower-skilled Americans living in states with high real unemployment\u00a0and bad news for productivity.\n\nThe rapid pace of 2014 immigration was the highest level since almost 1.7 million immigrants arrived in 2000, although most of those who arrived in 2000 were illegally searching for jobs in the dot.com boom.\n\nThat 2000 record is likely to have been broken during the second half of 2015, partly because of Obama\u2019s decision to allow Central American migrants to cross the border and ask judges for asylum, work-permits and Green Cards. From October 2012 to October 2016, Obama has used his power over agencies to allow 300,000 Central American migrants to seek asylum, at a cost of perhaps $200 billion\u00a0over the next 75 years. Roughly 117,000 of those Central American migrants were admitted in 2016.\n\n\n\nIn 2014, roughly 1.1 million of the 1.5 million migrants were legally admitted, while roughly 400,000 were illegals, according to the CIS. Many of the illegals sneaked across the border, but others flew into the country and overstayed their visas.\n\nDuring his tenure, Obama has sharply reduced border enforcement, reduced repatriations and has done little to deport foreign criminals.\n\nIn 2013, Obama also worked with business groups and the established media for passage of an immigration bill that would have provided citizenship for 33 million migrants over 10 years, increased the inflow of refugees and allowed an unlimited number of foreign graduate students to get Green Cards each year. The so-called \u201cComprehensive Immigration Reform\u201d bill was blocked by public opposition.\n\nHowever, Hillary Clinton has promised to implement many of those measures if she\u2019s elected \u2014 including the award of Green Cards to foreign professionals who enroll in U.S. graduate schools alongside young debt-burdened American graduates.\n\nSince 1965, the massive inflow of foreign migrants has pushed the total number of foreign-born people in the United States up to 43 million in 2015, alongside roughly 270 million Americans. That\u2019s roughly one foreign-born person for every seven Americans. If the 11 million illegals are discounted, then 270 million Americans are living alongside 33 million legal immigrants. That\u2019s almost one legal immigrant for every nine Americans, including the American-born children of the immigrants.\n\nBut the inflow has rapidly increased the numbers of immigrants and native-born Americans who speak a foreign language is their homes. \u201cNewly released Census Bureau data shows that a record 64.7 million U.S. residents five years of age and older spoke a language other than English at home in 2015 \u2026 up 5.2 million since 2010 and increased by 1.5 million in just the last year,\u201d according to the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nIn the economy, the annual inflow of immigrants is supplemented by a huge annual inflow of roughly 800,000 temporary, and lower-paid, guest workers. The blue-collar temporary workers, such as H-2B workers, are usually replaced each year by new blue-collar workers, but the number of resident long-term white-collar workers has risen to roughly 1 million during Obama\u2019s two terms.\n\nThe inflow of migrants is increasingly Asian, not Hispanic. Since 2010, according to CIS:\n\n\nMajor sending countries with the largest numerical increases in immigrants living in the United States since 2010 were India (up 609,000), China (up 510,000), the Philippines (up 205,000), the Dominican Republic (up 184,000), El Salvador (up 138,000), Cuba (up 106,000), Nigeria (up 104,000), Guatemala (up 97,000), Haiti (up 88,000), Pakistan (up 80,000), Honduras (up 76,000), Bangladesh (up 75,000), Venezuela (up 71,000), Colombia (up 63,000), Vietnam (up 60,000), and Iraq (up 55,000).\n\n\nThe states that have received the most migrants since 2010, according to CIS, are:\n\n\nStates with the largest numerical increases in the number of immigrants from 2010 to 2015 were California (up 538,000), Texas (up 529,000), Florida (up 428,000), New York (up 232,000), New Jersey (up 133,000), Massachusetts (up 112,000), Maryland (up 108,000), Virginia (up 108,000), Pennsylvania (up 98,000), Washington (up 94,000), Georgia (up 81,000), Minnesota (up 79,000), and North Carolina (up 76,000).\n\n\nObama is a progressive, and so he believes that the U.S. government should offer U.S. civil rights \u2014 and citizenship \u2014 to foreign-born people, regardless of what Americans prefer. In November 2014, he argued\u00a0that:\n\nSometimes we get attached to our particular tribe, our particular race, our particular religion, and then we start treating other folks differently. And that, sometimes, has been a bottleneck to how we think about immigration.\u00a0 If you look at the history of immigration in this country, each successive wave, there have been periods where the folks who were already here suddenly say, \u2018Well, I don't want those folks\u2019 \u2014 even though the only people who have the right to say that are some Native Americans.\n\nRead the full report here.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 6, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.0634572505950897, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 757, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 6.19517274087, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 22, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 22, "mft_sum": 41, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161101060000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "mft_mean": 3.72727272727, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 5.41611624834874, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/12/12/cia-russian-hacking-story-sham/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [245, 523, 565, 1014, 1042, 1647, 1916, 2018, 2097, 2501, 2590, 2627, 2632, 2819, 3356, 3382, 3537, 4748, 5094, 5540, 5729, 5779, 5838, 5899, 5904, 6099]}}, "headline": "10 Ways the CIA\u2019s \u2018Russian Hacking\u2019 Story is Left-Wing \u2018Fake News\u2019", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1006, "date": "20161212200000", "story_content": "On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) pledged to support a congressional investigation into whether Russian hacking affected the 2016 election. Republicans have\u00a0nothing to fear from such an investigation, because they won the election fair and square.\n\nNo, Russia is not the friend that President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spent several years pretending it was. But the idea that Russian hackers coronated\u00a0Trump is only the latest left-wing opiate\u00a0\u2014 after white supremacists and \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 designed to dull the pain of electoral defeat, and postpone the reckoning that must occur if Democrats are to pose a significant threat as an opposition party at any time in the near future.\n\nHere are just ten of the reasons the \u201cRussian hacking\u201d story is a sham \u2014 a left-wing twist on the red-baiting McCarthyism of the 1950s.\n\n1. There is actually no new information leading the CIA to its conclusion.\u00a0The New York Times reports:\u00a0\u201cThe C.I.A.'s conclusion does not appear to be the product of specific new intelligence obtained since the election, several American officials, including some who had read the agency's briefing, said on Sunday. Rather, it was an analysis of what many believe is overwhelming circumstantial evidence \u2014 evidence that others feel does not support firm judgments \u2014 that the Russians put a thumb on the scale for Mr. Trump, and got their desired outcome.\u201d In other words, someone only decided after Trump won that the accusation was worth making.\n\n2. The \u201cevidence\u201d that the CIA has gathered is inconclusive.\u00a0The FBI also disagrees with some of the CIA\u2019s conclusions about Russia\u2019s motives. \u201cWhile lawmakers were seemingly united on the need to present a strong bipartisan response, the FBI and CIA gave lawmakers differing accounts on Russia\u2019s motives, according to The Post,\u201d\u00a0The Hill reported on Sunday.\n\n3. The CIA is not making public claims that Russia hacked the election.\u00a0Several CIA veterans, in fact, have urged caution about the leaked reports. As\u00a0Newsweek reports: \u201c\u2018I am not saying that I don\u2019t think Russia did this,\u2019 Nada Bakos, a top former CIA counterterrorism officer tells Newsweek, in a typical comment. \u2018My main concern is that we will rush to judgment. The analysis needs to be cohesive and done the right way.'\u201d Thus far there is not even a clear idea what the CIA\u2019s conclusions are.\n\n4. Despite left-wing \u201cfake news,\u201d there is no evidence\u00a0Russian hackers actually distorted the voting process. The most that the CIA is alleging\u00a0is that the Russians may have helped\u00a0hack\u00a0of the Democratic National Committee emails, as well as (possibly) the emails of Hillary Clinton campaign chaiman John Podesta. There is zero evidence Russian hackers messed with voting.\u00a0Ironically, Green Party candidate Jill Stein\u2019s recount has eliminated any doubt about the integrity of the results.\n\n5. The Obama administration has a history of manipulating intelligence for political gain. The most under-reported scandal of Obama\u2019s presidency was the CENTCOM scandal, in which it emerged that \u201csenior U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) leaders manipulated intelligence assessments in 2014 and 2015 to make it appear that President Barack Obama is winning the war against the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL).\u201d There is even more\u00a0reason to doubt the truth\u00a0of a selective leak about the election.\n\n6. Julian Assange and Wikileaks have vigorously denied that the Russians were involved in Wikileaks\u2019 disclosures.\u00a0Of the Democratic National Committee emails, Assange said: \u201cThat is the circumstantial evidence that some Russian, or someone who wanted to make them look like a Russian, was involved, with these other media organisations. That is not the case for the material that we released.\u201d Assange made similar denials about the Podesta email leaks later in the election.\n\n7. The fact that the Russians might constantly be trying to hack U.S. systems, and might even specifically have targeted the election, does not prove that they succeeded. Nor does it prove that they tipped the election to Trump even if they had some effect. As pollster Frank Luntz tweeted: \u201cDid Russia also hack Hillary\u2019s campaign calendar and delete all her stops in rural Wisconsin, Penn., and Michigan?\u201d Hillary Clinton lost the election for reasons entirely of her own making.\n\n8. Foreign interference in elections is nothing new \u2014 and the Obama administration is a prime culprit. In 2015, the Obama administration made a strenuous and not-terribly-well-hidden effort to swing the Israeli elections toward the opposition and away from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The State Department gave $300,000 to a \u201cpro-peace\u201d Israeli group, which\u00a0then paid political activists whose goal was to unseat Netanyahu. In 1984, the late Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA) actually asked for Soviet help. Russian efforts to intervene would be bad, but not unique, either for Russia or for the U.S.\n\n9. What would the consequences of allowing undue Russian influence in our elections be, exactly? Would we yield\u00a0primacy in Eastern Europe to Vladimir Putin? Would we give up our plans for missile defense? Would we make deep unilateral cuts in our nuclear arsenal in exchange for flimsy concessions ? Would we tolerate a Russian land invasion of a friendly, pro-Western country? Would we cede the Middle East to Russian hegemony? Because Hillary Clinton and Obama already did that.\n\n10. Occam\u2019s razor: the simplest explanation for the \u201cRussian hacking\u201d story\u00a0is that it is \u201cfake news\u201d that suits the left-wing media. It is not unknown for Russia to use false propaganda to affect public opinion in foreign countries. Nor is it unknown for the U.S.\u00a0media to use bias, \u201cfake news,\u201d and outright lies\u00a0to shift public opinion in this country. The current focus\u00a0on Russian \u201chacking,\u201d based on no new evidence and \u2014 again \u2014\u00a0zero\u00a0evidence of tampering with the voting process.\n\nJoel B.

She said the process turns the milk into a pliable solid that can be shaped and colored before being covered in a top coat resin that hardens and protects the milk.\n\nShe said the idea first came from her love of breastfeeding her sons and orders began pouring in after she debuted the jewelry on Facebook.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 3.85802459716797, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 602, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.12815214964, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 1, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 11, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161214120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.82724252491694, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.0}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/10/31/report-nigerian-military-abused-raped-boko-haram-victims/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [147, 1483, 1749, 3379, 3429, 3578]}}, "headline": "Report: Nigerian Military, Police Raped Underaged Boko Haram Victims", "wordcount_as_scraped": 668, "date": "20161101020000", "story_content": "A devastating Human Rights Watch report published Monday accuses members of the\u00a0Nigerian military of raping underaged Boko Haram victims.\n\nNigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has said, through a presidential statement, that he is \u201cworried and shocked\u201d by the allegations and will launch an investigation into the matter, according to Reuters.\n\nHuman Rights Watch conducted a study documenting instances of rape, sexual harassment, inducement into sexual activity by promising food, and other such violations against the victims of the Islamic State-affiliated terrorist group. Many of these refugees \u2014 technically internally displaced persons (IDPs), as they are refugees in their own country \u2014 had already been the victims of rape and non-sexual violent attacks as part of Boko Haram raids, and live in the Maiduguri refugee camp because their villages have been deemed at high risk for subsequent terrorist attacks.\n\nThe NGO found 43 women and girls willing to discuss their experience of \u201csexual abuse, including rape, and exploitation\u201d at the camp. Maiduguri is the capital of northeast Borno State, where Boko Haram is headquartered.\n\nHuman Rights Watch\u2019s report notes that the situation in Maiduguri, however, is not unique: a Nigerian polling firm \u201creported that 66 percent of 400 displaced people in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe states said that camp officials sexually abuse the displaced women and girls.\u201d One\u00a0result has been a 40 percent increase in the number of HIV cases in the Maiduguri camp.\n\nThe girls and women who told their stories to the NGO accused an assortment of soldiers, police, and militia leaders of this behavior. Human Rights Watch reproduced in full one\u00a0particularly harrowing anecdote told by a 16-year-old girl:\n\nThe day he raped me, he offered me a drink in a cup. As soon as I drank it, I slept off. It was in his camp room. I knew something was wrong when I woke up. I was in pain, and blood was coming out of my private part. I felt weak and could not walk well. I did not tell anyone because I was afraid. When my menstrual period did not come, I knew I was pregnant and just wanted to die to join my dead mother. I was too ashamed to even go to the clinic for pregnancy care. I am so young!\n\nOthers said they were raped without being drugged, while yet other women say they were coerced into sexual relationships with police and troops after being promised food and marriage. Most who were impregnated in this way say the men who attacked them fled as soon as they learned of the pregnancy.\n\nReuters notes that Nigeria\u2019s national police force adamantly rejected all accusations. Buhari\u2019s office has nonetheless vowed an investigation. \u201cPresident Buhari has instructed the Inspector General of Police and the state governors of the affected states to immediately commence investigations into the issue,\u201d a statement from the president\u2019s office read Monday. \u201cWhile the Nigerian military continues to work hard so that these unfortunate victims of Boko Haram terrorism can soon return safely to their homes, the government will do its best to ensure their protection and welfare in the temporary IDP camps.\"\n\nThis is not the first report indicating that Nigerian men in government positions are using their power to abuse of Boko Haram victims. A report conducted in part by the\u00a0medical charity International Medical Corps (IMC)\u00a0in September found many women saying they needed to trade sex for food in order to avoid starvation. Before reports of sexual exploitation surfaced,\u00a0Doctors without Borders (MSF) issued calls to action regarding the Bama refugee camp, where the group said hundreds of refugees had starved to death.\n\nPresident Buhari announced in December 2015 that \u201ctechnically, we have won the war\u201d against Boko Haram. Since then, the group has conducted multiple village raids, suicide bombings, and attacks on military bases. Buhari\u2019s personal bodyguard was arrested for having ties to the Islamic State affiliate, as well, shortly before Buhari\u2019s government proclaimed once again that Boko Haram had been defeated.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -8.583690643310549, "HarmVice": 9, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 650, "FairnessVirtue": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.49627822141, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161101020000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 4.46153846153846, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/01/19/obamas-war-afghanistan-ruins-eight-years-later/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1792, 2970, 4407, 4495, 4779]}}, "headline": "Obama\u2019s \u2018Good War\u2019: Afghanistan in Ruins Eight Years Later", "wordcount_as_scraped": 964, "date": "20170119150000", "story_content": "A discussion about President Barack Obama's legacy cannot ignore his policies in Afghanistan, where security conditions continue to deteriorate primarily at the hands of the Taliban, Afghans have suffered record casualties, and U.S. military fatalities have dramatically increased under his watch.\n\nThe rise of the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) in Iraq and Syria has continued to overshadow Obama's war in Afghanistan even after the group established its still growing branch in the South Asian nation.\n\nThe president\u2019s legacy on Afghanistan cannot be measured without taking into account what he inherited from George W. Bush. President Bush had been well aware at the end of his presidency that he was leaving behind Afghanistan a challenge. In his memoir Decision Points, he acknowledged Afghanistan was \"unfinished business,\" adding that the effort to transform the country into a stable democracy had \"turned out to be more daunting than I anticipated.\"\n\nNevertheless, the war found a successor willing to put in more time and resources, including human capital, into the ongoing effort.\n\n\"As President, I will make the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban the top priority that it should be. This is a war that we have to win,\" Obama vowed in a major 2008 campaign speech on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Obama also vowed to turn the \u201cgood war\u201d in Afghanistan around and pull out all U.S. service members.\n\nEight years later, U.S. military fatalities in the war have more than quadrupled from 558 under Bush to 2,247 under Obama, Pentagon data shows. There were 1,689 U.S. military deaths in Afghanistan under Obama, a figure that makes up more than 75 percent of all American fatalities since the war started in October 2001.\u00a0The number of U.S. military injuries has increased more than 7-fold, from 2,702 under Bush to 20,237 now, according to Pentagon figures.\n\nThe number of U.S. military injuries under Obama\u2019s watch (17,535) account for more than 90 percent of all 20,237 wounded in action incidents throughout the 15-year-old war.\n\nAlmost immediately after implementing his own strategy, violence dramatically worsened in 2009, peaking in 2010, the deadliest year (497 deaths) for U.S. troops in Afghanistan.\n\nObama presided over the top three deadliest years of the war: 2009 (303 deaths); 2010 (497 deaths); and 2011 (399). U.S. military fatalities under Bush peaked in 2008 at 151, according to a Breitbart News analysis of Pentagon data.\n\nAt nearly 100,000 in 2010, the presence of the American military also reached its zenith under Obama.\n\nThe rules of engagement have also been a subject of contempt for analysts and U.S. service members alike.\n\nA top commander of U.S. and NATO troops indicated that, after the end of the combat mission on December 31, 2014, American forces fighting Taliban jihadists had to wait to be shot at first to be able to attack. Being a member of the Taliban was\u00a0no longer a justification for U.S. troops to open fire, attack a even as the terrorist group expands its territorial control across the war-ravaged nation.\n\nThe Taliban currently controls more territory now than at any time since the group's regime was dethrone by the U.S. military in 2001. In the year after President Obama declared an end to the U.S. combat mission (2015), the Taliban surpassed their ISIS jihadist rivals as the the world's chief perpetrators of terrorist attacks, with 1,093 individual attacks, reported U.S. State Department.\n\nNevertheless, U.S. troops are still banned from offensively attacking the Taliban. American forces can only attack from a position of defense.\n\nDespite allegations to the contrary by the Pentagon, American troops continued to be drawn into combat against a resilient Taliban after Obama said U.S. forces had ceased their combat mission in the country, as do their Afghan counterparts. While a lot can be said about the capability lapses suffered by the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF), which include police and army units, it is difficult to argue the Afghans lacked the will to fight to defend their country. More Afghan forces died in some one-year periods than U.S. military service members throughout the entire war. Afghan civilians have also suffered record numbers of casualties.\n\nIn addition to the human life investment in the war, Obama\u2019s strategy provided\u00a0more American taxpayer dollars in the form of reconstruction assistance, to the tune of\u00a0more than $115 billion. The congressionally-appointed Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) has found some of that money has been funneled to the Taliban under both Bush and Obama.\n\nU.S. government policies dealing with reconstruction funds may have fueled\u00a0the growth of the endemic and widespread corruption in Afghanistan and aided terrorist groups targeting American soldiers, reported SIGAR.\n\nEradication and interdiction efforts dealing with the illicit cultivation and production of the illicit drug opium, a lucrative source of funding for the Taliban, collapsed under Obama. Afghanistan remains the world\u2019s top producer of opium and its heroin derivative, at least a small portion of which is fueling the ongoing deadly opiate epidemic in the United States, according to the DEA.\n\nObama took ownership of the conflict in Afghanistan when he escalated U.S. military presence and operations soon after taking office. Yet in various exit speeches and press conferences involving the President, little has been mentioned about the war.\n\nIn his farewell address to the armed forces, Obama touted having reduced the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. A few days later, news reports surfaced that the outgoing president had decided to deploy an additional 300 U.S. Marines to the volatile and opium-rich southern Afghanistan region, a historical Taliban and al-Qaeda stronghold.\n\nDespite vowing to pull all American forces out of Afghanistan by the time he leaves office, the President decided to change course last year and maintain about 8,400 troops into 2017.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.7961163520813, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 925, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 28, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 7.75023326762, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 28, "mft_sum": 50, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170119150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.405405405405411, "mft_mean": 4.54545454545}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/11/06/exclusive-gen-mike-flynn-hillary-clintons-email-setup-was-unbelievable-active-criminal-behavior/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [323, 6647]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1084, "scraper_regex": 1139}}, "headline": "Exclusive \u2014 Gen.

Gen. Michael T.\u00a0Flynn detailed how she broke the law with her illicit, home-brew email server.\n\n\"It was a violation of the law. It's not just violation of State Department guidelines,\" Flynn told SiriusXM host Matthew Boyle. \"Let's forget about the pedophilia, let's forget about the Clinton Foundation for a second and let's focus on Hillary Clinton's grave risk that she's placed our country at by using a private server to do business at the most sensitive levels of our government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's beyond [just against] State Department policy. That's a criminal act,\u201d he added. \u201cI have been part of investigations where people have spied on our country or done espionage been used to extort information for purposes of damaging our country. That's what Hillary Clinton has done. This is beyond violating State Department policy. If that's all it was, I wouldn't be sitting here today. This is an unbelievable active criminal behavior.\"\n\nFlynn said that the media is covering up Clinton's alleged crimes:\n\nPeople need to know what this is and so the mainstream media\u2014all of the media, basically 99 percent of the media\u2014doesn't even bother with it anymore. Nobody even covers it anymore. This is dangerous for our country and then you throw in all this stuff from this past week\u2014you have this case against Anthony Weiner and he's directly tied to Hillary Clinton. He's under multiple investigations. Then you have the Clinton Foundation, which is under multiple investigations by the FBI, and not just one but multiple. You have the reopening of the national security investigation by the FBI directly against Hillary Clinton, that's another one that's open. So I mean we are stupid people, we are stupid people in this country is we elect Hillary Clinton to be our next president because we're going to have nothing but scandal and dark cloud scandal over our country for the next four years and we cannot afford it with all the problems we face in this country and all the problems we face around the world. What we need is we need to drain the damn swamp. We need to get new leadership in our country, we need to get fresh blood in our country, and we need to stop the madness we are facing with this era of corruption in our country that has been going on for decades. We have got to stop it.\n\nFlynn was President Barack Obama's Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) director for two years. A lifelong Democrat, this is the first time he's ever supported a Republican for president in his life in Donald J. Trump\u2014the Republican nominee for president. He expects many more Democrats like himself, thanks to Clinton's indefensible behavior, to vote for Trump.\n\n\"What we're going to see is not only a strong Republican turnout but strong Democratic turnout for Donald Trump,\" Flynn said. \"We're going to see people going in that are registered Democrats going in and say 'I'm voting for Trump because I can't vote for this crooked person, this criminal person who has damaged our country.'\"\n\nFlynn also said this is \"more than the most important\" election in most Americans' lifetimes.\n\n\"It's more than the most important presidential election in our lifetimes,\" Flynn said. \"It's one of the most important in the history of our country. You can rattle off guys like George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, both Teddy and Franklin Roosevelt. Ronald Reagan. This raises to that level, because our country is either going to become a socialist country or we're going to continue on a path to prosperity with Donald Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe closing arguing, and it's really one of the questions I had asked when I first met him\u2014'Why do you want to be president?'\u2014he loves this country. Donald Trump loves the United States of America,\u201d he continued. \u201cHe has been able to benefit from the time he was a kid all the way up, he has seen what the power of opportunity and what the power of prosperity can bring to the United States of America and he knows he has the leadership and the vision and he's got the team of people around him to be able to do that. He sincerely understands.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has the instincts, he has the leadership ability, he has the decision-making ability and he has the vision. His vision statement, 'Let's Make America Great Again,' has captured the imagination of millions and millions of people around the country and that's why I believe really strongly he's going to be our next president,\" he said.\n\nHe added that as Donald Trump barnstorms blue states like Minnesota, Virginia and more, the Clinton campaign is in \"a tailspin\" thanks to Hillary Clinton's illicit actions during her time as Secretary of State.\n\n\"I think if you watch the tailspin that the entire Clinton machine is in right now, for just a number of criminal activities, it's just stunning,\" Flynn said. \"I can't even understand why anyone would go out and vote for her, to be honest with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe firewall states that the Democrats and Hillary Clinton had no problem winning is where Donald Trump now is either even or up if you believe the polls. I don't,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhat I believe is that there is an incredible amount of enthusiasm to change the leadership in Washington, D.C., and as Donald has so clearly stated, to drain the swamp of the political establishment in Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlaces like Michigan is one of the states, even New Hampshire\u2014he's been in and out of New Hampshire now quite a bit\u2014and other places.

And yet, some people refuse to recognize the urgency of fighting the real war and the necessity of forming alliances with all of Islam\u2019s declared enemies.\n\nIt is amazing how many people have forgotten how we defeated Hitler in World War II. We did not do it alone.\n\nThe United States and Britain joined with Stalin to defeat our common enemy, the Third Reich. Radical Islam poses as great a threat to the United States today as Adolph Hitler did in 1941. Indeed, Hitler had not yet attacked the United States in 1941, while radical Islam has done so many times.\n\nRussia is also at war with radical Islam \u2014 both inside its borders and in regions adjoining its borders, including the Middle East. That fact was brought home by the assassination last week of the Russian Ambassador to Turkey by an Islamist who happened to be a Turkish citizen. The Russian ambassador was not killed in retaliation for Russian support of the regime in Turkey, he was killed because Russia is supporting the Syrian government\u2019s war against the ISIS insurgency in Syria.\n\nJust as radical Islam\u2019s terrorist atrocities span nations and boundaries, so, too, must our alliances against radical Islam. This is a mushrooming clash of civilizations that must be won before other, lesser battles can be engaged.\n\nIt ought not be a shocking concept for the United States to join with Russia in an alliance to defeat a common enemy, whether the battlefront be in Iraq, Egypt or Syria. The Cold War is over. Russia is no longer an ideological enemy of the United States. No, Putin is not our friend, but neither is he a mortal enemy to be shunned in all circumstances.\n\nWinston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt met with Stalin twice in World War II, at Potsdam and Yalta, because they had a common enemy. Nixon went to China to meet Mao Tse-tung to form form an alliance against a greater threat, the Soviet Union. Trump can and should meet with Putin to form an alliance against our common enemy, radical Islam.\n\nAn open alliance with Russia against radical Islam makes such good sense that the most vociferous opponents are the foreign policy \"experts\" who refuse to admit the need for think in terms of any declaration of war against radical Islam. If there is no war, then we do not need new allies, Russian or Egyptian or whatever.\n\nWhen Trump meets with Putin, the first item on that agenda should be a public repudiation of Obama\u2019s failed, disastrous \"pseudo-policy\" in Syria, a pseudo-policy because it was more an embarrassment than an actual guide to American actions. President Putin could then announce support for a coordinated military effort in Iraq and the region to wipe out any remaining ISIS strongholds.\n\nIt is obvious that America\u2019s national interests and Russia\u2019s interests will not always coincide, but it ought to be equally obvious that neither do they always diverge. In the case of radical Islam, our interests are identical: radical Islam must be destroyed, and the sooner the better.\n\nAn alliance to accomplish that specific goal will not interfere with our commitment to NATO or other alliances around the globe. That bogeyman ought to be laid to rest.\n\nYes, the alliance with Russia will be opposed by the Democrats and the foreign policy establishment that saw nothing strange about Obama making his first foreign trip to Cairo to praise the Muslim Brotherhood. But an alliance to actually defeat radical Islam rather than coddle it may well strike most Americans as a sensible departure from Obama\u2019s failed \"legacy.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9,

\u2013 said we could speak our minds, worship freely, defend ourselves, be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures, and expect to be treated fairly if accused of a crime.\n\nIn contrast to almost all of the legislation Congress passes today, the Bill of Rights is full of language such as \"Congress shall make no law\" and \"The right of the people\u2026 shall not be violated,\" along with a guarantee that non-delegated powers or those not specifically denied the states \"are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.\"\u00a0\n\nWith this document, the Founders drew a line in the sand a few inches from the government's feet.\n\nNot all of these 225 years have been kind to the Bill of Rights, though.\u00a0 It's been challenged, debated, and far too often just ignored.\n\nDon't be fooled into thinking this would have surprised the Founders.\n\nWe have the Bill of Rights precisely because the Founding Fathers knew government can't resist stretching its limits.\u00a0 Much like Benjamin Franklin's reported statement that we had a Republic if we could \"keep it,\" the Bill of Rights relies on the people holding government accountable.\n\nWhen some in government say \"of course we can,\" you and I are supposed to use the Bill of Rights to say, \"No, you can't.\"\n\nSome believe government has grown too large to hold down with these chains, that it's too late to rein it back in.\u00a0 If the Bill of Rights were mere words on paper, perhaps we could afford to indulge that feeling.\n\nBut they are not mere words.\u00a0 They are principles fundamental to who we are as a people and what we represent as a nation.\u00a0 If we stop caring enough to preserve them, we will lose more than a few liberties.\u00a0\n\nWe will become something else entirely.\n\nThat's one reason we must defend the entire Bill of Rights.\u00a0 If you expect to be able to speak freely, then surveillance that shreds the Fourth Amendment stops just being the other guy's problem.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf you let the government decide the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says, then why should it hold to a strict definition of due process or freedom of the press?\n\nWe don't have the luxury of playing favorites.\u00a0 We have the responsibility of getting it right.\n\nIn a time where so many are divided, this provides us with a clear path forward.\u00a0 We can unite on a Constitution that binds us together by the same standard, and we can demand all politicians stay within those rules to best benefit us all.\n\nIf that document needs to be changed, as the Founders expected it would, let's follow their example by properly amending it, as they did with the ten amendments we celebrate today.\n\nThere's no better time than the present to drop the status quo and adopt this \"new\" approach.\n\nI am excited for the upcoming opportunities we will have to institute long-overdue reforms, roll back an overzealous and misguided bureaucracy, and return to a government that works for the people instead of the special interests.\n\nOn this 225th\u00a0anniversary, let us rededicate ourselves to the principles and boundaries found in the Bill of Rights, and let us recommit to passing them on honored and intact.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.9917355179786679, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH":

(AP) \u2014 The death toll from a fire that tore through a warehouse hosting a late-night dance party jumped to 30 on Sunday as firefighters painstakingly combed through rubble for others believed to still be missing.\n\nOnly a fraction of the charred remains of the partly collapsed structure had been searched, and crews clearing debris were expected to find more bodies as they advanced, Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Sgt. Ray Kelly said.\n\nAnxious family members who feared the worst gathered at the sheriff\u2019s office to await word on their loved ones. They were told they may have to provide DNA samples to help identify remains.\n\nThe building known as the \u201cGhost Ship\u201d had been carved into artist studios and was an illegal home for a rotating cast of a dozen or more people, according to former denizens who said it was a cluttered death trap with few exits, piles of wood and a mess of snaking electric cords.\n\n\u201cIf you were going there for a party, you wouldn\u2019t be aware of the maze that you have to go through to get out,\u201d said Danielle Boudreaux, a former friend of the couple who ran the warehouse.\n\nAs many as 100 people were there for a party Friday night when the fire broke out just before midnight. Fire officials were still investigating the cause of the blaze, but they said clutter fueled the flames, there were no sprinklers inside and few exits to escape.\n\nBoudreaux identified the operators of the Satya Yuga collective as Derick Ion Almena and Micah Allison. She had a falling out with Almena when she convinced Allison\u2019s parents and sister about a year ago that the warehouse was a dangerous place for the couple\u2019s three children to live.\n\nThe couple rented out five recreational vehicles and other nooks on the ground floor as living spaces. A rickety makeshift staircase led to a second floor where concerts were held. Former residents said there frequently was no electricity or running water.\n\nOakland planning officials opened an investigation last month after repeated complaints from neighbors who said trash was piling up and people were illegally living in the building zoned as a warehouse. An inspector who went to the premises couldn\u2019t get inside, said Darin Ranelletti, of the Oakland Planning Department.\n\nThe city had not confirmed people lived there, but a former resident said she had been lured in part by reasonable rents in a region beset with a housing shortage and exorbitant leases driven by the tech boom.\n\nShelley Mack said she wasn\u2019t told the residence was illegal until after she moved in a couple years ago and stayed for four to five months, paying about $700 a month. She said she was instructed to tell visitors it was a 24-hour workspace for artists and when outsiders or inspectors planned to visit, residents would scurry to hide clothes and bedding.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a horror house. Just horrors in there,\u201d she said.\n\nTo a first-time visitor, though, the labyrinth of uniquely designed spaces was \u201cstunning,\u201d said Alastair Boone, a University of California, Berkeley student who arrived at the party with five friends around 11 p.m.\n\nPhotographs from before the fire showed that the Bohemian community of musicians, painters, woodworkers, dancers and other artists had decorated the scene with Tibetan prayer flags, Christmas lights and scores of wooden statues of Buddha, the virgin Mary, Jesus Christ, elephants and dragons that sat atop pianos and turntables. Tapestries hung from the walls, mannequin legs and arms stuck out from the ceiling and a small wooden spot of floor was used for art performances.\n\n\u201cIt was obvious to me everyone who lives there cared about each other and were invested in a space they made a home,\u201d Boone said.\n\nAlmena did not immediately respond to emails or phone numbers associated with him. Authorities declined to talk about the manager, saying they were focused on recovering the bodies and consoling families.\n\nA man identified as Derick Ion posted a Facebook message early Saturday, saying, \u201cEverything I worked so hard for is gone. Blessed that my children and Micah were at a hotel safe and sound.\u201d He drew rebukes online from others who said he was warned the building was unsafe.\n\nAlmena, 46, has lived in California since at least 1990, mostly in Los Angeles, where public records show he was evicted from a North Hollywood apartment in Los Angeles in 1993.\n\nAllison, 40, spent much of her life residing in Northern California, although she had also lived in Southern California, where she filed for a fictitious business name, Sacred Image, at a Los Angeles address.\n\nOnline records listed the building\u2019s owner as Nar Siu Chor. The Associated Press could not locate a telephone number for her Saturday. Efforts to reach her at other Oakland addresses associated with her were not successful.\n\nBoone said she had just received a tour of the property and stepped outside when someone yelled, \u201cFire!\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a couple of minutes there were flames coming out of the windows and black smoke was just billowing out of the house,\u201d she said.\n\nSome of the people who got out were crying and others stood silently in shock as firefighters arrived to put the flames out.\n\n\u201cThe people who lived there were clustered together, and they were just so sad,\u201d Boone said. \u201cThey were losing their loved ones, and there was nothing they could do.\u201d\n\nMonica Kat was outside the warehouse Saturday and said she feared four of her friends are dead. \u201cThey\u2019re still not accounted for, and I can only think the worst at this point,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nMelley reported from San Francisco.

CDU deputy chairman Thomas Strobl last week set out a demand to streamline the extradition of rejected asylum seekers.\n\nBut it remains unclear if his proposal will be put to the congress, or whether party leaders will try to quash unwelcomed suggestions through backroom compromises.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Merkel?\n\nWith the party congress, the CDU kicks off a long election campaign in which Merkel will seek to capture the middle ground.\n\nCDU general secretary Peter Tauber said \u201call the questions that currently preoccupy the population also preoccupy CDU members\u201d.\n\nMerkel\u2019s party next year faces three state elections, with momentum steadily building to the last regional poll in May in Germany\u2019s most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia.\n\nThe new year promises to throw up a host of new international challenges. It will see Trump move into the White House and Britain start its EU exit negotiations.\n\nMerkel will also watch carefully the hotly contested French presidential election and its impact on key EU issues, including migration and attitude towards Russia.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.9971510171890259, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 647, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 0.881396337712, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 3, "mft_sum": 7, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161203130000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.0819165378670799, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.636363636364}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/11/02/academic-government-encourage-white-families-stay-diverse-areas/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [920, 960, 1558, 2691, 2696]}}, "headline": "White Flight: Number of Families Halve in Some Areas as Academics Urge Ethnic Brits to Stay in Urban Areas", "wordcount_as_scraped": 813, "date": "20161102160000", "story_content": "A leading academic has called on the government to tackle white flight from British cities \"as a national priority\", as a study reveals the white population in some areas has halved in just ten years.\n\nAlthough Britain has grown increasingly ethnically diverse over the last few decades, analysis of the British population council area by council area \u2013 and in some cases ward by ward \u2013 shows a mounting trend towards segregation.\n\nIn one instance a man living in Yorkshire told researchers that he was the first Asian to move into a street, and within three years all the white families had left, The Guardian reported.\n\n\"Some of those families made no bones about it \u2013 they are moving out because \u2018they\u2019 are moving in,\" he said.\n\nIn some areas the demographic change has been stark, such as Newham in East London\u00a0\u2013 described by locals as \u201clike Baghdad\u201d\u00a0\u2013 where the white population halved from 33.6 per cent in 2001 to 16.7 per cent in 2011. The 2021 census is expected to show the trend continuing.\n\nProf. Ted Cantle, who first authored a report into community cohesion after a series of race riots in 2001, warned that segregated societies \"breed intolerance and prejudice\", adding: \"We know the opposite is true \u2013 there is a huge amount of research that shows any form of contact does break down stereotypes.\"\n\nCantle, who co-authored the report into Britain's changing demographics with Prof. Eric Kaufmann at Birkbeck, University of London, told\u00a0The Guardian that the government should encourage white British families to remain in ethnically diverse areas to put a brake on the trend.\n\nExamining census data from 1991, 2001, and 2011, they found increasing polarisation across the country, with the steepest decline in white population in \"urban pockets\". Slough showed one of the largest drops in white population, down from 58.3 per cent in 2001 to 34.5 per cent by 2011, while Luton dropped from 64.9 per cent to 44.6 per cent in the same period.\n\nOn a ward level the evidence for segregation was even starker: in one part of the Blackburn and Darwen council area, a mere 7.8 per cent of the population was white British, down from 42.3 per cent in 1991. Similarly, Small Heath in Birmingham saw the white population decline from 40.4 per cent to 11.2 per cent, and in Handsworth it dropped from 30.7 per cent to just 7.2 per cent.\n\nAlthough the academics place the blame at the feet of white families leaving these areas, Asians moving in admit they enjoy living among others who share their culture.\n\nMohammed Tabrez Noorji, who opened his butchers in Blackburn last year,\u00a0told\u00a0The Guardian: \"I do sometimes speak to the white people when they walk past but there is nothing for them to buy here.\n\n\"It is not good that we all live separately but how can we fix this problem? Asian families like to live in the same area as each other so we can support one another, but then the white people move out.\n\n\"It\u2019s not that we deliberately choose to live separately \u2013 it is just what happens. We want to live in this area because we are close to the mosques and all our families are very close to each other.\"\n\nNonetheless, Cantle insisted: \"The antipathy towards some communities may have been much less if we were more integrated and actually lived in mixed areas \u2013 all the evidence suggests that prejudice and intolerance is broken down by contact.\n\n\"This research shows what is happening on a local level and that is that there is increasing polarisation between the white majority population and minorities across England, particularly in our urban areas.\n\n\"This has gone under the radar, but it is time this became a national priority because cohesion is at stake.\n\n\"The focus of policy needs to shift, this is not just about minorities. Politicians and policy-makers need to encourage white British residents to remain in diverse areas; to choose, rather than avoid, diverse areas when they do re-locate, encouraging similar choices with respect to placing pupils in diverse schools; in other words to create a positive choice for mixed areas and a shared society.\"\n\nChuka Umunna MP, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on social integration, said the report from Cantle and Kauffman laid \"bare the striking pace of change in some of our communities\".\n\nIn the study's foreword, he said the report was a clear call for policymakers to intervene. \"It is clear we cannot carry on with a laissez-faire approach to integration in our country. Integration is a two-way street and all parts of society have a role to play in preventing the UK becoming more fragmented.\n\n\"If we fail to do so, we risk sleepwalking into a situation where the divisions exposed during the EU referendum campaign become deeper as we grapple with the challenges thrown up by globalisation.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 20, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.5522041320800803, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 814, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.63782972135, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 20, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161102160000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002, "FairnessVice": 5, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.8083538083538104, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/12/02/kellogg-foundations-director-of-racial-equity-wanted-castro-to-rest-in-power/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [197, 380, 384, 676, 781, 862, 1421, 2353, 2595, 2619]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 729, "scraper_regex": 781}}, "headline": "Kellogg Foundation's Director of Racial Equity Wanted Castro to \u2018Rest in Power\u2019", "wordcount_as_scraped": 781, "date": "20161202160000", "story_content": "With the Kellogg Company\u2019s announcement that they pulled their advertising from Breitbart News because Breitbart isn\u2019t\u00a0\"aligned with our values,\" many consumers might wonder what those values are.

Kellogg Foundation\u2019s website, its\u00a0Director of Racial Equity and community engagement is Rev. Alvin Herring. Rev. Herring\u2019s LinkedIn resume\u00a0shows he\u2019s spent years as a director with the PICO National Network, one of many\u00a0prominent institutional left activist groups funded in part by leftwing billionaire George Soros.\n\nRev. Herring paid tribute to Fidel Castro in a recent tweet:\n\nRest in power #Fiidel\n\u2014 Rev. Alvin Herring (@Alvin4Community) November 26, 2016\n\n\n\nIn another tweet, Rev. Herring reposts an article called \"Why black Americans love Fidel Castro\" that praised Castro for pardoning convicted cop killer Assata Shakur.\n\nhttps://t.co/CSA6d1RA2I\n\u2014 Rev. Alvin Herring (@Alvin4Community) November 27, 2016var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([\"embed\"]);\n\n\n\nIn the article\u00a0written by Hermano Fidel and tweeted by the Kellogg Foundation\u2019s Rev. Herring, Castro is praised for harboring cop-murdering black nationalist extremist JoAnne Chesimard, AKA Assata Shakur:\n\nWhen it came to matching words with deeds on the topic of racial equality, the most stalwart leader of the Western hemisphere, over the course of the 20th century, was Fidel Castro\u2026\n\u2026It was Fidel who gave amnesty to Joanne Chesimard, known now as Assata Shakur, still wanted in the 1973 killing of a New Jersey state trooper, Werner Foerster, in a highway shootout. Shakur was convicted but was busted out of prison in 1979 by comrades. As a leading figure in the Black Liberation Army, which took bolder actions than even the Black Panther Party did, not only getting into gun fights with cops but holding up banks, Shakur became a legend in her time, a Robin Hood of the black masses.\n\nAs Breitbart News has reported, Shakur was part of a\u00a0group known as the Black Liberation Army, whose members killed a number of police officers in a nationwide reign of terror in the early 1970s. Shakur was tried and convicted of the murder of a New Jersey state trooper, but later escaped from\u00a0prison with the help of\u00a0a left-wing radical group known as The Family, which included members of the Weather Underground. At that point, Shakur fled to Cuba, where she has been living in exile ever since.\n\nThe author of the article that Herring retweeted goes on to call Fidel \"a kind of Martin Luther King with power.\"\n\nRev. Herring's own writings show his willingness to blame law enforcement and side with rioters. In an article written by Rev. Herring for Sojourners in August of 2016 about the Ferguson protests, he shifts the blame away from the rioters and onto the police:\n\nLast night democracy was trampled not as the media would suggest by the angry footfalls of sullen youth determined to disturb the peace and wreak havoc in their own community, but by the heavy march of a police force that seemed determined to create tension and antagonize young people \u2014 young people who are carrying the trauma of nights of unrest and lifetimes of dehumanizing racism.\nLaw enforcement was outfitted with the machinery of war. The officers wore military fatigues and carried automatic weapons. They were helmeted, with their faces obscured, and in the darkness they looked more like machines than human beings. They perched atop huge military vehicles with glaring lights and screeching sirens. It was otherworldly \u2014 and all of this to face down a group of wounded children, wounded tonight and many nights before this night.\n\nSojourners has received major funding in the past from the Soros-affiliated Open Society Foundation, as well as various other funders in the institutional left. The Discover Institute\u2019s Jay Richards reported on Sojourners\u2019 funding in an article on National Review:\n\n\u2026it's implausible for [Sojourners President and Founder Jim] Wallis to claim that grants between 2004 and 2007 totaling $325,000 are \"the tiniest fraction\" of Sojourners' funding.\nBesides the Soros grants, for instance, there are two 2006 grants from the infamous Tides Foundation totaling $72,106; a Ford Foundation grant in 2008 for $100,000; a Rockefeller Brothers Fund grant for $100,000 in 2005; and a $50,000 grant from the Wallace Global Fund in 2008.\n\nAs Breitbart News has reported, the far-left groups the Tides Center and Tides Foundation, based in San Francisco, have received over 120 grants from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation.\n\nThis story is developing\u2026\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.602923393249509, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 729, "FairnessVirtue": 4, "HarmVice": 7, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.7658754867699997, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 33, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161202160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.5267489711934195, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.0}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/12/24/24-dec-16-world-view-south-sudan-increasingly-parallels-syria-genocidal-violence/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1318, "scraper_regex": 1422}}, "headline": "World View: South Sudan Increasingly Parallels Syria in Genocidal Violence", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1422, "date": "20161224180000", "story_content": "This morning\u2019s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com\n\nUN Security Council fails to impose arms embargo on South Sudan\n\n\nUN peacekeeping forces in South Sudan (AP)\n\nHumanitarian organizations are expressing outrage as the United Nations Security Council failed on Friday to pass a US-sponsored resolution to impose an arms embargo on South Sudan and placed a travel ban and asset freeze on three senior South Sudanese leaders.\n\nAccording to the UNSC rules, for the resolution to pass it would have required 9 of the 15 members to vote in favor, and none of the 5 permanent members (US, UK, Russia, China, France) to veto it. As it turned out, those who opposed the measure needed only to abstain, since there were not 9 votes available to pass it. Japan, Russia, China, Angola, Malaysia, Venezuela, Egypt and Senegal all abstained.\n\nSouth Sudan is the world\u2019s youngest nation, having gained independence from Sudan in 2011. The region\u2019s last generational crisis war was an ethnic war mainly between two tribes, the Nuer and the Dinka. That war climaxed with the \u201cBor Massacre,\u201d which began on November 15, 1991. The Nuer army marched toward the provincial capital Bor and massacred the people of the Dinka tribe. Over the next three months, 2,000 civilians were killed, thousands more wounded, and at least 100,000 people fled the area. Famine followed the massacre, as looters burnt villages and raided cattle, resulting in the deaths of 25,000 more from starvation.\n\nA new conflict began on December 15, 2013, led by the president Salva Kiir, of the Dinka tribe, fighting against forces led by vice president Riek Machar, of the Nuer tribe. Kiir and Machar signed a peace agreement in August 2015, but that did little good.\n\nHuman Rights Watch is expressing outrage that the UNSC resolution failed to pass. According to HRW, both sides have been importing weapons and using them to fight the other side. HRW says that African Union and UN investigators have documented war crimes, including killings and rape of civilians, and forced recruitment of children by the warring parties in South Sudan. In the last few months there has been an increase in incitement to violence, hate speech by senior leaders, and targeting of civilians, sometimes based on ethnicity.\n\nUnited Nations officials had been calling for the arms embargo and also an injection of peacekeeping forces, saying that South Sudan is getting closer and closer to a \u201cRwanda-like genocide.\u201d However, they\u2019ve been saying that for months, and no Rwanda-like genocide has occurred, largely because South Sudan is in a generational Awakening era. not in a Crisis era, which would be required for a Rwanda-like genocide to occur.\n\nEarlier this year, the Security Council adopted a resolution authorizing 4,000 troops from African nations to join 12,000 U.N. peacekeeping forces there. However, South Sudan\u2019s president Salva Kiir rejected the peacekeeping troops to enter the country, saying that he would fight them as if they were an invading army. Those peacekeepers who did serve in South Sudan were withdrawn in the summer, after they were accused of failing to protect civilians from rape and sexual violence.\n\nAs an aside, you may wonder why decades of international aid to Africa has failed to have any effect whatsoever on poverty. The situation in South Sudan provides a good illustration of what happens. Usually the international aid goes into foreign bank accounts of leaders, but otherwise it\u2019s spent on weapons to kill, rape and torture people opposing the leaders. Reuters and Human Rights Watch and NPR (11-Nov)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nLeaders of South Sudan and Syria following parallel paths to genocide\n\nFrom the point of view of Generational Dynamics, Syria and South Sudan are in very similar generational eras, with leaders who are behaving in similar ways.\n\nSouth Sudan\u2019s last generational crisis war was an ethnic civil war between the Dinka versus the Nuer tribes, climaxing with the Bor Massacre in November, 1991, as described above. The Bor Massacre stands as a defining moment in the history of South Sudan. It was so shocking that it largely ended the war.\n\nSyria\u2019s last generational crisis war was a religious/ethnic civil war between the Shia Alawites versus the Sunnis. That war climaxed in February 1982 with the destruction of the town of Hama. There had been a massive uprising of the 400,000 mostly Sunni citizens of Hama against Syria\u2019s Shia/Alawite president Hafez al-Assad, the current president\u2019s father. He turned the town to rubble and killed or displaced hundreds of thousands. Hama stands as a defining moment in the Middle East. It was so shocking that it largely ended the war.\n\nSo both Syria and South Sudan today are in generational Awakening eras, as the first generation of children growing up after the previous crisis civil war come of age. These children did not personally experience the wars, but they listened to stories of how the other side committed massacres and rapes while their fathers were heroes who endured despite those atrocities. The children never hear about how their fathers also committed atrocities and rapes.\n\nAnother parallel between Syria and South Sudan is that the wars depend on outside intervention, almost to the point of being a proxy war. In South Sudan, Kiir is receiving military aid from Uganda, while Machar is receiving military aid from (northern) Sudan. In Syria, Bashar al-Assad is receiving military aid from Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah, while different opposition groups are receiving military aid from Turkey and from Salafist groups in Saudi Arabia.\n\nFrom a theoretical point of view, when a country goes through a civil war that\u2019s also a generational crisis war, then as the first post-war generation grows up, the leaders become increasingly oppressive and violent towards peaceful opponents (usually a different religious or ethnic group), and use as an excuse the claim that they might start another civil war (which is almost impossible during a generational Awakening era). This is a generational pattern that\u2019s followed over and over, in country after country, throughout history.\n\nWhat we\u2019re seeing in both Syria and South Sudan is a familiar pattern that I\u2019ve described many times in countries like Burundi, Thailand, and Zimbabwe, starting 5-15 years after the climax of a generational ethnic crisis war. The leadership in the country, which represents one ethnic tribe or group, decides that in order to prevent a new civil war, it\u2019s necessary to impose \u201csecurity\u201d by having the security forces commit atrocities against the other ethnic group.\n\nThere\u2019s a wide spectrum of violence of this type. In Thailand, there\u2019s been sporadic violence by the army, backing the \u201cyellow shirt\u201d market-dominant light-skinned Thai-Chinese elite minority against the the \u201cred shirt\u201d dark-skinned Thai-Thai indigenous ethnics, but so far the violence hasn\u2019t been too serious.\n\nIn South Sudan, possibly the biggest driver of the war is not ethnic differences but oil. South Sudan has a wealth of oil, and all the warring parties would like to control as much of that oil as they can. A particularly interesting example of this is China, which is heavily invested in South Sudan and is supporting Salva Kiir. Chinese officials scream bloody murder when anyone complains about their massacring of Tibetans, saying that no one has the right to interfere in their internal affairs, but China has no hesitation to interfere in other countries\u2019 internal affairs when their own interests are a stake.\n\nAnother parallel between Syria and South Sudan is that as genocide by the countries\u2019 leaders continues right under the noses of everyone in the world, the United Nations is powerless to do anything about it because the two nations that fully support massacres, rapes, genocides and other atrocities are Russia and China, and they have veto power in the UN Security Council.\n\nIn Syria and South Sudan, in contrast to Thailand, the violence is reaching the highest levels, approaching full-scale genocide. What makes this difference from a crisis civil war is that in the latter case, the violence is \u201corganic\u201d, in that it comes from the people and cannot be stopped. In the case of Awakening era genocide, the violence could be stopped simply if the leader stopped massacring the opposition tribes, or if outside countries would stop supporting the genocidal acts.

Unsurprisingly, the first country to make spanking illegal was Sweden, in 1979, followed by Finland in 1983. The last to join the list before France in 2016 were Mongolia, Paraguay and Slovenia.\n\nThe decision of the French parliament follows a symbolic reprimand by the Council of Europe in 2015 decrying France's lack of a specific law \"prohibiting corporal punishment in a clear, binding and precise way, including slaps and spankings, in breach of Article 17 of the European Charter of Social Rights.\"\n\n\"To comply with Article 17, states' domestic law must prohibit and penalize all forms of violence against children,\" the Charter states, and the relevant provisions \"must be sufficiently clear, binding and precise, so as to preclude the courts from refusing to apply them to violence against children.\"\n\nThe legislation barring all corporal punishment reportedly relies on the opinion of a majority of psychologists that such forms of discipline are ineffective or counterproductive.\n\nDr. Gustavo Pietropolli Charmet, a psychiatrist and chairman of the Italian non-profit Help Center for Mistreated Children, said that laws prohibiting corporal punishment are useful because it has become clear that \"the educational value of physical and moral pain is zero.\"\n\nSuffering \"does not strengthen education and does not improve self-esteem,\" Charmet said. \"In fact, it can create guilt, fear and vengeance.\"\n\nCommenters were quick to express their approval or disapproval with France's decision.\n\n\"Life also smacks us from time to time. Will we eliminate those as well? Useless psychologists,\" wrote Giulio Francomanno.\n\nAnother reader noted that spanking \"anticipates the lesson that children will learn from life as they grow up, namely, that if you do not respect certain rules, there will be consequences.\"\n\nIn February 2015, Pope Francis expressed his approval\u00a0of parents who spank their kids, as long as it is carried out with respect for their dignity. His words drew a wave of reactions, both negative and positive, to the idea that corporal punishment is okay.\n\n\"It is disappointing that anyone with that sort of influence would make such a comment,\" said Peter Newell, the coordinator of the Global Alliance to End Corporal Punishment of Children.\n\nDespite the extensive debate regarding the value or detriment of corporal punishment, few have questioned the more problematic aspect of a creeping intromission of the state in the lives of families and their choice of how to educate their children.\n\nThe Catholic Church teaches that the state should not interfere with parents' education of children except in grave and extraordinary circumstances.\n\n\"Since parents have given children their life, they are bound by the most serious obligation to educate their offspring and therefore must be recognized as the primary and principal educators,\" Catholic doctrine states.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

A senior security official said the Karak attackers had planned multiple attacks in Jordan on New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nThe government dismisses IS as a fringe phenomenon and says Jordan\u2019s security forces can contain any threat \u2013 but the Dec. 18 shooting set disconcerting precedents.\n\nIt marked the first time IS claimed an attack on a civilian site in Jordan, a spot popular with tourists. A Canadian woman and two local residents were among 10 people killed.\n\nThe four shooters were sons of Jordanian tribes, traditionally a pillar of support for the monarchy. Local media said they were college-educated men in their late 20s and early 30s, underscoring the appeal of IS ideology among some Jordanians.\n\nThe security establishment, meanwhile, faced rare criticism over its failure to prevent the attack, with more than one-third of parliament members calling for a vote of no-confidence in the interior minister.\n\nMarwan Shehadeh, an expert on militants, said the Karak shooting signaled \u201ca remarkable change\u201d in IS tactics. \u201cThe year 2017 will be the year of great security challenges in Jordan,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernment spokesman Mohammed Momani said Jordan, a member of the U.S.-led military coalition against IS, is a target, but has countered threats because of social cohesion and what he said are well-trained security forces.\n\n\u201cWe know we have been successful in stopping them on many other occasions,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at what is happening in countries around us \u2026 you see our ability to preserve our stability and security.\u201d\n\nJordan\u2019s confrontation with IS goes back to 2014, when the kingdom began carrying out air strikes as part of an international campaign to dislodge IS from neighboring Syria and Iraq where the militants captured large areas.\n\nBut Jordan\u2019s military strikes have not kept the militants from its borders, and have made the kingdom a target.\n\nLast year, seven IS supporters and a Jordanian officer were killed in a shootout during an arrest raid. In June, IS sent a car bomb from Syria that killed seven Jordanian troops. Lone gunmen carried out three separate attacks at Jordanian security installations, with five Americans among the dead. Jordanian officials have remained silent about the attackers\u2019 motives.\n\nAs IS comes under growing pressure in Syria and Iraq, a gradual retreat there might generate an even stronger incentive for the group to carry out mass attacks elsewhere to affirm its relevance.\n\nJordan is a logical target because of the visible presence of Western installations and foreigners, said David Schenker of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\n\nThe U.S. is providing $1.6 billion in economic and military support to its beleaguered ally in 2017.\n\nStill, any U.S. concerns about Jordan may be overshadowed by the turmoil next door, said Schenker. \u201cThe narrative here in Washington is that the threat is pretty large, but that Jordan can handle it,\u201d he said.\n\nJordan has clamped down on suspected IS sympathizers since 2014, with several hundred serving prison terms and five recently sentenced to death.\n\nAfter the Karak shooting, security forces detained dozens more people. Twenty-two hard-line preachers who refused to pray for the Karak victims will be punished, said Religious Affairs Minister Wael Arabiyat.\n\nCritics say Jordan fails to address the wider causes of the militants\u2019 appeal among Jordanians, hundreds of whom have been fighting in the ranks of IS in Iraq and Syria.\n\nMusleh Tarawneh, a Karak legislator who led the recent push in parliament to dismiss the interior minister, noted that unemployment in his district has risen to 25 percent and that university graduates can\u2019t find jobs. \u201cIslamic State found a way to enter the Jordanian tribes through poverty and unemployment,\u201d he said.\n\nThe rise in unemployment is a result of long-term trends that could take years to reverse, including an economic slump caused in part by regional instability. The Karak shooting dealt another setback to an already struggling tourism industry, once a vital sector of Jordan\u2019s economy.\n\nLast week, damage inflicted by the gunmen in Karak was still visible.\n\nGlass shards from a window shattered by gunfire covered the floor of the Shehab Restaurant at the castle gate. Linda Vatcher, a retired Canadian teacher, had stood in front of the restaurant when the white pickup carrying the four assailants screeched to a halt near her and assailants opened fire, killing her, said Jamal Saoub, a witness.\n\nAt nearby King\u2019s Castle restaurant, four tourists from France and Italy were eating lunch when the shots rang out, with at least two bullets piercing the glass door of the dining room, said waiter Abdel-Al Ibrahim, 52.\n\nThe attackers held off the security forces for hours, firing from slits in the castle walls before they were killed.\n\nThere has been speculation that the Karak cell targeted the castle spontaneously, after its hideout was discovered earlier that day. Atef al-Saoud, the head of the Public Security Directorate, said last week that the cell had planned to carry out New Year\u2019s Eve attacks with five explosives belts.\n\nIndividual tourists from the United States, Italy and Switzerland seemed undeterred, walking outside the castle last week, a day before it reopened.\n\nThey said they felt safe since the probability of a second attack in the same spot is low. They also said that attacks by militants can happen anywhere, pointing to recent incidents in Berlin and Istanbul.\n\nEmily Clymer, 31, a U.S. academic from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, said she feels safer in the Jordanian capital, Amman, where she works, than in the United States. Jordanian security forces \u201ctake precautions, they react quickly,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2014", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.04500961303711, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 939, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 21, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 6.69278629793, "HarmVirtue": 14, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 21, "mft_sum": 50, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170109130000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.3248136315229, "mft_mean": 4.54545454545}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/news/the-latest-russian-divers-to-work-all-night-at-crash-site/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "The Latest: Russian divers to work all night at crash site", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1118, "date": "20161226040000", "story_content": "MOSCOW (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the crash of a Russian aircraft with 92 people on board en route to Russia\u2019s air base in Syria (all times local):\n\n9:55 p.m.\n\nRussian emergency crews are aiming to work all night searching the Black Sea off Sochi for victims and plane debris after a Russian Tu-154 carrying 92 passengers and crew crashed right after takeoff before dawn.\n\nMore than 3,000 people \u2014 including over 100 divers flown in from across Russia \u2014 were working Sunday from 32 ships and several helicopters to search the crash site, the Defense Ministry said.

That review includes input from all sixteen U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\nDr. Jafar is infamous for his uranium enrichment genius and known to possess deep ties to Iran, Russia, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). That Dr. Jafar was a national security threat is evidenced by the fact that he was wanted by coalition forces at the outset of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n\n\n\nDr. Jafar and his brother Hamid Jafar hold leadership positions at The Crescent Group, which owns Gulftainer, with Dr. Jafar serving as CEO of Crescent's URUK Engineering and Contracting subsidiary while Hamid serves as Chairman of The Crescent Group.\n\nCargo\u00a0container terminals\u00a0are\u00a0the\u00a0very location at which national security\u00a0experts fear the U.S. homeland is most vulnerable.\n\n\"Lawmakers said an undetected radiological weapon smuggled into a U.S. port inside a cargo container is at the top of the list of homeland security nightmares\" reported FCW in July 2016.\n\nAviation and cargo security expert Glen Winn, who is also a former Secret Service agent, asserted that \"while we may not be able to check every cargo container coming into the country without bringing global commerce to a standstill, it is imperative that the lessees to America's ports receive the proper National Security Threat Analysis. That is the point at which you maintain your national security.\"\n\nIn 2011, San Diego Assistant Port Director Al Hallor \u2013 who at the time was also a high-ranking Customs and Border Protection officer at the port \u2013\u00a0told San Diego's ABC 10 News that a \"weapon of mass effect\" had been found,\u00a0but not at the port itself. The Department of Homeland Security soon tried to walk back Hallor's statements, insisting that he was \"nervous\" and \"misspoke\" during the interview.\n\n\n\nThe Port Canaveral/Gulftainer deal is especially disconcerting because Port Canaveral plays a major role in space exploration and the strategic defense of the nation.\n\nPort Canaveral, a component of U.S. critical infrastructure, is in close proximity to a U.S. Navy nuclear submarine base, two U.S. Air Force Space Command bases, and NASA's Kennedy Space Center. In military jargon, Gulftainer is \"inside the wire.\"\n\nCanaveral is also the second busiest\u00a0cruise ship\u00a0port in the world.\n\nGeorge Cecalia, Communications Director for Representative Bill Posey (R-FL), whose district includes Port Canaveral, and the\u00a0Congressman's military expert, said in an interview that the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission briefed them on the Gulftainer deal. The Commission reportedly assured Posey's staff that the Gulftainer Port Canveral deal was a \"run of the mill contract.\" They claim they were not informed that the lessee was the notorious Dr. Jafar and his brother Hamid Jafar.\n\nOfficials with Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay's Submarine Group 10, in conversation with Alan Jones, said they became alarmed in October 2012 upon learning that Dr. Jafar was connected to Gulftainer. Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay's Submarine Group 10 often moves Ohio-class ballistic missile nuclear submarines in and out of Port Canaveral. The Navy officials say they contacted the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) and FBI counter-terrorism officials.\n\nA SpaceX official speaking to Alan Jones in Florida reacted with an \"oh [expletive]\" upon learning that Gulftainer, which handles recovery of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket booster at Port Canaveral, has ties\u00a0to Dr. Jafar. The official added that the information would immediately be communicated to senior SpaceX officials, including CEO Elon Musk.\n\nAlan Jones is an investigative journalist who broke a series of national security stories at\u00a0Washington Times Communities.\n\nMary Fanning is an investigative journalist who covers the Middle East and national security,\u00a0known for her series \"The Betrayal Papers.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 21, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.9536784887313839, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 657, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 6.35843943638, "HarmVirtue": 11, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 21, "mft_sum": 38, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161105200000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.45454545455, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 5.783866057838661, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/11/28/republican-led-congress-oversees-large-scale-importation-of-somali-migrants/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [393, 600, 783, 795, 835, 954, 988, 1097, 1111, 1178, 1433, 1464, 1501, 1574, 1859, 1911, 2329, 2395, 2414, 2431, 2691, 2775, 3468, 3513, 3644, 3669, 3694, 3997, 4004, 4037, 4066, 4074, 4239, 4245, 4644, 4676, 4772, 4844, 4984, 4999, 5040, 5050, 5112, 5123, 5143, 5424, 5433, 5475, 5481, 5607, 5924, 5959, 5964, 6412, 6843, 7107, 7264, 7449, 7497, 7938, 8443, 8519, 8704, 9345, 9865, 10368, 10520, 10546, 10556, 10759, 10904, 10950, 11235]}}, "headline": "Republican-Led Congress Oversees Large-Scale Importation of Somali Migrants", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1807, "date": "20161129060000", "story_content": "The Somali refugee responsible for attacking young Americans at Ohio State University was deliberately imported into the country by the nation\u2019s federal immigration policy\u2013yet the scale and impact of immigration from undeveloped, foreign cultures is still a surprise to some politicians.\n\nSince 2001, the United States\u00a0has permanently resettled nearly 100,000 migrants from Somalia\u2013a nation where the prevalence rate of Female Genital Mutilation for women and girls ages 15 to 49 is 98 percent, and where homosexuality can be\u00a0punishable by death. In a single year, a Republican-led Congress funded visas for nearly 300,000 (temporary and permanent) Muslim migrants, which is a population that is nearly twice\u00a0the size of\u00a0the entire population of Dayton, Ohio. \u00a0\n\nThe federal government invited Abdul Razak Ali Artan, 18, into the United States as a refugee, according to reports.\u00a0Artan reportedly came to the U.S.\u00a0in 2014, and his refugee status allowed him to fill a coveted slot at Ohio State University. It also allowed\u00a0him to obtain\u00a0federal benefits, and eventually would have given him quick access\u00a0to citizenship, the voting booth, and the ability to bring over foreign relatives through chain migration.\n\nYet some Republican lawmakers seem unaware of the social and cultural impact that large-scale Muslim migration has had in their own backyards.\n\nIn\u00a0an October 2015 interview with\u00a0Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, Breitbart News\u00a0 asked Jordan about Ohio\u2019s Somali population and reports documenting how\u00a0more than 20,000 girls in Ohio are at risk of having their sexual organs cut from their bodies through the Somali practice of female genital mutilation.\n\n\"In Ohio? Wow,\u201d Jordan, who is the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said in response.\n\nWhen Breitbart asked if Jordan thought\u00a0the nation\u2019s policy of annually dispensing visas to\u00a0more than a quarter of a million (temporary and permanent) Muslim migrants ought to be curbed, Jordan replied, \"I'd have to look at that closer. I have not looked at that particular.\"\n\nOn Monday, Breitbart News asked Jordan\u2019s office if he regrets not having paid attention to the nation\u2019s federal immigration policy responsible for the attack on the Ohio State campus. Breitbart also asked if Jordan plans to champion\u00a0legislation that will pause the refugee program.\n\nJordan\u2019s office\u00a0did not respond to\u00a0Breitbart News\u2019s\u00a0questions.\n\nHowever, Jordan was not the only member of the House Freedom Caucus who has admitted that he is unfamiliar with basic aspects of U.S. immigration law. Jordan\u2019s comments came just a few days before Freedom Caucus co-founder Mick Mulvaney told South\u00a0Carolina radio host Bob McCalin, \"Honestly I have no idea what the number of legal \u00a0green cards [issued annually] is\"\u2014 even though Mulvaney's website suggests immigration rates should be increased even higher.\n\nEvery single year the U.S. admits one million plus foreign nationals on green cards, one million guest workers, dependents, and refugees, and half a million foreign students.\n\nUnder current federal policy, the U.S. admits more than two times more Muslim migrants each year than there are Jim Jordan voters in Ohio's fourth Congressional district\u2014 and roughly half of these migrants will be able to apply for citizenship. According to Pew, only 11 percent of Muslims vote Republican or even lean Republican.\n\nSince Ohio voters sent Jordan to Washington D.C. in 2007,\u00a0the U.S. has permanently resettled more than\u00a050,000 Somali migrants. FBI officials are now watching the community to block additional jihad attacks by Somali migrants.\n\nAs the\u00a0Minneapolis Star Tribune\u00a0has reported, Minnesota,\u00a0which is home to the nation\u2019s largest Somali population, \u201cleads the nation in would-be ISIL terrorists from the U.S.\u201d according to a 2015 Congressional report.\n\n\"During the last two years, more than 20 Somali-Americans from Minnesota have left to fight alongside terrorists under the banner of ISIL,\" a\u00a0report\u00a0from 2015 states.\n\nIn September,\u00a0a Somali immigrant allegedly\u00a0stabbed\u00a0nine people at a Minnesota mall while shouting \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d and asking his would-be victims whether they were Muslim.\n\nEarlier this year, Fox News's Bill O'Reilly\u00a0asked\u00a0Speaker Ryan specifically about the Somali refugee crisis in Minnesota.\n\n\"We have a Somali problem up in Minneapolis-St. Paul,\" O'Reilly told Ryan. \"[We] have a problem there and those are refugees from Somalia. And if, God forbid, some refugee comes in and blows people up, it's going to be grisly.\"\n\nRyan replied by claiming that he and the House had \u201cpassed a bill pausing this refugee program.\u201d\u00a0However, Ryan's declaration was\u00a0demonstrably false. As NumbersUSA's Rosemary Jenks explained, the House bill championed by Ryan\u00a0did not in any way pause the Somali refugee program and, in fact, would\u00a0\"not have affected the Somali refugee program at all.\"\n\nDespite the House Speaker\u2019s seeming inaction on pausing the Somali refugee program,\u00a0in August, the\u00a0Senate Immigration Subcommittee compiled\u00a0a list of\u00a0some of the recent instances of Somali refugees who have been\u00a0implicated\u00a0in terrorism:\n\n\u2013 On\u00a0April 20, 2015, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota, Abdurahman Yasin Daud was charged (along with six others) with conspiracy and attempt to provide material support to ISIS. Daud, a Somalian refugee who came to the United States as a child, and subsequently\u00a0obtained\u00a0a green card. Daud and another individual\u00a0drove\u00a0from Minnesota to San Diego to attempt to get passports, cross the border into Mexico, and fly to Syria in to join ISIS.\n\u2013 On\u00a0February 5, 2015, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, Abdinassir Mohamud Ibrahim was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison for conspiring to provide material support to Al-Shabaab, a designated foreign terrorist organization, and for making a false statement in his immigration paperwork.\u00a0Ibrahim is a native of Somalia who\u00a0came\u00a0to the United States as a refugee in 2007 at the age of 22 and subsequently obtained a green card. Ibrahim knowingly lied on his citizenship application and previously lied in his request for refugee status, by falsely claiming that he was of a member of the minority Awer clan in Somalia and subject to persecution by the majority Hawiye clan. Ibrahim was actually a member of the Hawiye clan and not subject to persecution. In fact, according to\u00a0court documents, \"Ibrahim's family was famous . . . [and] [t]hrough his clan lineage, Ibrahim was related to known Somali terrorists[.]\" Ibrahim also admitted he lied on his citizenship application by having previously lied on his refugee application by falsely claiming that he had not provided material support to a terrorist group, when he had in fact provided material support in the form of cash to an Al-Shabaab member.\n\u2013 On\u00a0January 29, 2015, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, a federal warrant was unsealed for the arrest of Liban Haji Mohamed for allegedly providing material support to Harakat Shabaab Al-Mujahidin, also known as Al-Shabaab and Al-Qaeda.\u00a0Mohamed is a native of Somalia who sources indicate came to the United States as a refugee, obtained a green card, and subsequently applied for and received\u00a0citizenship. He is believed to have left the United States on July 5, 2012, with the intent to join Al-Shabaab in East Africa. Mohamed previously lived in the Washington, D.C. area and\u00a0worked as a cab driver, and is believed to have\u00a0snuckacross the border to Mexico after being placed on the no-fly list. Carl Ghattas, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Washington, D.C. Field Office emphasized the importance of locating Mohamed, \"because he has knowledge of the Washington, D.C. area's infrastructure such as shopping areas, Metro, airports, and government buildings . . . [t]his makes him an asset to his terrorist associates who might plot attacks on U.S. soil.\"\n\u2013 On\u00a0November 18, 2013, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Issa Doreh was sentenced to ten years in prison for \"conspiracy to provide material support to terrorist, conspiracy to provide material support to foreign terrorist organization, conspiracy to launder monetary instruments, and providing material support to foreign terrorist organization.\" Doreh was admitted to the United States as a refugee from Somalia and subsequently obtained a green card and became a citizen.\u00a0Doreh worked at a money transmitting business that was at the center of the\u00a0conspiracy, which also involved Ahmed Nasir Taalil Mohamud.\n\nDuring the 2015 interview with Breitbart News, Jordan revealed that the Freedom Caucus had received no commitment from Paul\u00a0Ryan that he would in any way try to curb the nation's importation of Muslims on visas in exchange for their support for him as House Speaker.\n\nThe admission was significant because the Freedom Caucus played a key role in installing Ryan, who has a two-decade-long history of pushing open borders immigration policies as House Speaker. Indeed, as Speaker, Ryan championed an omnibus spending bill that fully funded Obama\u2019s refugee resettlement operation and expanded the importation of migrants from the Muslim world.\n\nFederal law makes clear that as President, Donald Trump will be able to act on his own to block certain foreign nationals\u00a0from entering the nation.\n\nSection 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act states:\n\nWhenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate\u2026\n\nAs the Daily Caller's\u00a0Alex Pfeiffer has reported, all of the past six presidents have used the authority this statute provides to block certain classes of immigrants from entering the country. Temple University Law Professor Jan Ting told the Daily Caller that existing law \"absolutely and without any doubt\" would allow a President Trump to restrict immigration of certain nationalities or religious groups.\n\nYet Ryan, who leads the pro-Islamic migration wing of the Republican Party, has previously suggested that he would\u00a0personally push back against President Trump if he were to use his authority to act on this issue.\n\nIn a June interview with the anti-Trump publication\u00a0The Huffington Post, Ryan\u00a0suggested\u00a0that he would sue a President Trump if he were to use his executive authority to temporarily pause Muslim migration into the United States.\n\nDespite Ryan\u2019s repeatedly stated opposition to curbing Muslim\u00a0migration, on November 15th, Ryan was re-nominated to serve as House Speaker by a voice-vote of Republican lawmakers\u2014with the backing of many in\u00a0the House Freedom Caucus.\n\nRyan was nominated\u00a0by House Freedom Caucus Rep. Mulvaney, who shares Ryan's support for large-scale immigration.\n\nBreitbart News reached out to House Freedom Caucus Chairman Jordan\u2019s office and asked if he plans to support Ryan for House Speaker in January\u2019s election. Jordan\u2019s office did not respond to\u00a0Breitbart News\u2019s inquiry.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 38, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.7383177280426003, "HarmVice": 6, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1742, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 13, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 13.117397443900002, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 32, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 38, "mft_sum": 93, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161129060000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "mft_mean": 8.45454545455, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 5.33869115958668, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/11/16/parents-urge-anti-common-core-education-secretary/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [348, 424, 669, 3861, 4261]}}, "headline": "Parents Groups Urge Trump to Appoint Anti-Common Core Education Secretary", "wordcount_as_scraped": 815, "date": "20161116130000", "story_content": "Grassroots parents groups are urging President-elect Donald Trump to choose an education secretary who has been opposed to the Common Core standards and will scale back the federal education department.\n\n\"While campaigning, President-elect Trump sent a strong message that he\u00a0planned to end Common Core and dismantle the U.S. Department of Education,\"\u00a0Dr. Anna Arthurs, a parent activist in Louisiana, tells Breitbart News. \"If this is his true intent, then it comes as quite a surprise to see that his 'short list' of Secretary of Education nominees includes so many pro-Common Core individuals.\u00a0His voters want him to keep his promise.\"\n\nThe grassroots groups have been fighting against federal intervention in education for years. They\u2019ve activated email alerts in light of what has been released as Trump's short list of possible candidates for U.S. Education Department (USED) secretary. The list includes:\n\n\"Some of the names being floated as possible Secretary of Education are troubling,\" explains Jane Robbins, education fellow at American Principles Project, adding:\n\nTrump\u2019s most consistent education-related commitment during the campaign was to end Common Core and restore local control, and that won\u2019t happen if the Department of Education is run by someone who has supported or protected Common Core in the past. Mr. Trump needs to listen to the grassroots forces who are relying on him to restore local autonomy in education.\n\n\"The grassroots believe Trump to be a man of his word, and they don\u2019t doubt that he would reject any candidate with a questionable track record on Common Core,\" Erin Tuttle of Indiana says. \"With the recent rumors of pro-Common Core candidates being floated for the position, the grassroots is concerned that the proper vetting isn\u2019t taking place.\"\n\nParent activist Heidi Huber of Ohio sent the following statement to Breitbart News:\n\nPresident-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s promise to return education to local communities rests in his appointment of a Secretary of Education who truly understands the corruption and cronyism within the education reform swamp, and who has been on the front lines fighting against FedEd a.k.a. Common Core. Williamson (Bill) Evers, President-elect Trump\u2019s education transition team leader, is just that individual. I know Mr. Evers personally and was so grateful for his two testimonies before the Ohio legislature to warn of the harm of Common Core centralization and the historical success of competitive federalism.\n\n\"When Donald Trump talked on the campaign trail about 'the forgotten men and women' of America, many of us who have been fighting Common Core in the trenches felt like he was talking to us,\" says Heather Crossin of Indiana, who adds that many parents have lost a voice in their children's education.\n\n\"We are counting on President-elect Trump to stand up and fight for us against the powerful special interests, who not only profit off of Common Core but who pull the strings of the vast majority of politicians in both parties,\" she explains.\n\nDr. Karen Effrem of Florida also points to Trump's promise to end Common Core and make education local once again.\n\n\"Choosing pro-Common Core, establishment people like Tony Bennett, Michelle Rhee, or Eva Moskowitz would be a complete betrayal to those parents in every state who helped elect him,\" she says.\n\nWhile on the campaign trail, Trump said Common Core is a \"disaster\" and that Washington, D.C. should leave education to states and local school districts. Most of Trump's recent discussion about education has been in the area of school choice.\n\nLance Izumi, director of the Center for Education at Pacific Research Institute, told Breitbart News that while school choice as a central strategy for success for all students is very positive, it\u00a0should not come about with government \u201cstrings\u201d attached.\n\n\"Trump said that states should come up with their own formulas and programs as to how to implement choice, so it is imperative that both the federal government and the states ensure that private schools are protected from intrusive government regulations and mandates,\" he said.\n\nThe Cato Institute's Neal McCluskey also told Breitbart News\u00a0that school choice is \"the key to empowering parents to get the education that is best for their unique children, and for educators to teach how they want and try new, innovative approaches.\"\n\n\"But this is not something that should come from Washington,\" he warned, adding:\n\nThe federal government has no constitutional authority to meddle in education, and as it has proven over the last several decades\u2014including by coercing states to adopt the Common Core\u2014once it starts paying for education it starts controlling it, telling everyone what to do and how to do it. The federal government should be withdrawn from education except in Washington, DC, itself, federal installations, and prohibiting state and local discrimination in providing education.\n\n\"It is what the Constitution demands, and fifty-plus years of experience with federal spending and interference tells us is right,\" McCluskey said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.16009283065796, "HarmVice": 5, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 786, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.23421922317, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161116130000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 2.9262086513994903, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/11/15/iran-nuclear-deal-obama-wrought-let-trump-put-asunder/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [387, 394, 415, 609, 620, 746, 764, 769, 1038, 1583, 1593, 1685, 1694, 1843, 1851, 1900, 2526, 2537, 2743, 2752, 2835, 2850, 2992, 3006, 3031, 3040, 3153, 3303, 3309, 3435, 3465, 3509, 3515, 3636, 3648, 3695, 3818, 3824, 3994, 4050, 4059, 4133, 4184, 4192, 4403, 4414, 4636, 4642, 5050, 5592, 5598, 5973, 5992, 6036, 6051, 6145, 6158, 6193, 6202]}}, "headline": "Iran Nuclear Deal: What Obama Has Wrought, Let Trump Put Asunder", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1116, "date": "20161117150000", "story_content": "We have heard President Barack Obama, on several occasions, endeavor to allay fears about world violence. His nuclear deal with Iran does not do this. It now is up to President-elect Donald Trump either to re-negotiate an agreement that will or to reject it.\n\nObama\u2019s false assurances the world is safer have sounded like a\u00a0broken\u00a0record.\n\nIn 2011, he\u00a0suggested, after U.S. Navy SEALs killed Osama bin Laden, \"I think we can all agree\u2026 the world is safer. It is a better place because of the death of Osama bin Laden.\"\n\nIn 2013, he made the same\u00a0suggestion\u00a0while addressing the United Nations (UN), \"The world is more stable than it was 5 years ago.\"\n\nIn 2014, at a Democratic Party\u00a0fundraiser, Obama\u00a0told\u00a0the audience, although \"the world has always been messy\u2026 I promise you things are much less dangerous now than they were 20 years ago, 25 years ago or 30 years ago.\"\n\nAnd, in 2015, in the aftermath of concluding a nuclear deal with Iran, again addressing the UN, Obama\u00a0claimed, \"if this deal is fully implemented, the prohibition on nuclear weapons is strengthened, a potential war is averted, our world is safer.\"\n\nIn that same address, Obama told two flagrant lies, which took wings during the 2016 vice presidential debate between Senator Tim Kaine and Governor Mike Pence \u2014 the former repeating them; the latter challenging him on doing so.\n\nObama's lies to the UN were contained in the following statements: \"Our objective was to test whether Iran could change course, accept constraints, and allow the world\u00a0to verify\u00a0that its nuclear program will be peaceful\u2026 The result is a lasting, comprehensive deal that\u00a0prevents\u00a0Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, while allowing it to access peaceful energy.\"\n\nAt least eight times during the vice presidential debate, Kaine\u00a0alluded\u00a0to the assertion Hillary Clinton had \"eliminated\u00a0the Iranian nuclear-weapons program without firing a shot.\"\n\nSuch representations leave the American public with a false sense of security about Iran, built upon the foundation of Obama's earlier assertions the world is safer today.\n\nIt is absolutely imperative President-elect Donald Trump re-negotiate or kill the Iran nuclear agreement. In doing so, Americans need to realize just how bad it is.\n\nImagine, for example, a U.S. government drug-testing program implemented for its employees allowing the unsupervised submission of their own urine samples. Just such an \"honor policy\" is what Obama accepts for Iran concerning\u00a0submission\u00a0to international inspectors of its own soil samples at a site where nuclear weapons testing is believed to have occurred.\n\nSuch an honor policy extends as well to limiting inspections only to nuclear sites\u00a0declared\u00a0as such by Tehran. If Iran has undeclared secret nuclear sites, which has been its\u00a0modus operandi\u00a0in the past, international monitors lack standing to inspect them.\n\nAdditionally, as Obama rammed the agreement through the Senate, an effort\u00a0quarterbacked\u00a0by Kaine, the Senate was\u00a0not told\u00a0about secret side deals attached to it \u2013 some details of which top U.S. negotiator Secretary of State John Kerry\u00a0did not even know.\n\nThe dark truth about the Iran nuclear agreement is it absolutely fails to stop the mullahs' desire to weaponize their program. It\u00a0paves\u00a0the way for them to do so legally in the future, and sooner if illegally done. Additionally, it failed to demand Iran, as the\u00a0world's leading state sponsor\u00a0of terrorism, curtail such activity or stop\u00a0using\u00a0North Korea as a nuclear and missile test site.\n\nThe above failings of the Iran nuclear agreement combined with Tehran's\u00a0intensified\u00a0aggression against the U.S. since its approval\u00a0should not give Americans any sense the world is safer today because of the deal, evidenced most recently by Iran's brazen\u00a0claim\u00a0it is sending elite fighters covertly into the U.S. and Europe.\n\nSince coming to power in 1979, Iran's mullahs have been led by two spiritual leaders: Ayatollah Ruhollah\u00a0Khomeini, up until his death in 1989, and Ayatollah Ali\u00a0Khamenei\u00a0since then. Both shared the same mindset concerning their goal of Islam's\u00a0global domination.\n\nUpon coming to power, Khomeini\u00a0stopped\u00a0Iran's peaceful nuclear program, initially begun under the shah, only later to secretly re-start it, giving rise to suspicions he sought weaponization. A Khomeini statement is most telling about this suspicion,\u00a0suggesting\u00a0fear of a U.S. nuclear retaliatory strike serves as no deterrent to Iran: \"I say let this land go up in smoke, provided Islam emerges triumphant in the rest of the world.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Khamenei allegedly issued a religious\u00a0edict\u00a0(fatwa) claiming Islam prohibits nuclear weapons. This should be given little faith as: (1) Iran refuses to produce a copy of it; (2) Islam allows, under the concept of \"taqiyya,\" Muslims to deceive and lie to non-Muslims to further Islam's global domination; and (3) former Iranian President Ayatollah Ali Rafsanjani suggests a more frightening and honest assessment of Tehran's nuclear intentions with his\u00a0statement:\n\nIf a day comes when the world of Islam is duly equipped with the arms Israel has in possession, the strategy of colonialism would face a stalemate because application of an atomic bomb would not leave anything in Israel but the same thing would just produce damages in the Muslim world.\n\nSuch a claim should worry Palestinians who would suffer harsh consequences of an Iranian nuclear attack on Israel as well.\n\nNor should Khamenei's alleged edict give us comfort in view of his recent exhortation, given just this month, what is\u00a0meant\u00a0in Iran's often-heard chant, \"Death to America.\"\n\nSpeaking to hundreds of his worshippers, Khamenei explained, \"When you chant 'Death to America,' when you are told to direct all your chants against America, it means: Death for all these things (that America represents).\"\n\nTrump's election has riled Khamenei enough to cause the Supreme Leader to claim, as president, Trump\u00a0cannot renegotiate\u00a0a nuclear agreement made with the UN. While\u00a0it was not and\u00a0Trump can, Khamenei ignores two other important facts empowering Trump legally to do so: Iran\u00a0never signed\u00a0the deal and Tehran has repeatedly\u00a0violated\u00a0it.\n\nIt is clear, as Iran gains confidence it has secured the pathway to obtaining a nuclear arsenal, it envisions Islam's global objective as obtainable. It now will be up to President Trump to dispel this Iranian mindset\u2014one President Obama's actions have tragically wrought.\n\nLt. Colonel James G.

In fact, the big bang is one of nuclear proportion. And, when it occurs, it will have both Iranian and North Korean fingerprints on it.\n\nIn July 2015, President Obama\u00a0negotiated\u00a0a nuclear agreement with Iran \u2013 after promising us he would never agree to a deal giving Tehran nuclear weapons \u2013 doing exactly that. While he and Clinton boasted\u00a0they\u00a0stopped\u00a0Iran's nuclear program without firing a shot, that shot will ultimately be a nuclear one fired by Iran.\n\nIn an agreement even more one-sided than U.K. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's 1938 deal with Germany's Adolf Hitler that was supposed to guarantee \"peace for our time\" but ultimately failed, President Obama paved the way for the mullahs to\u00a0have nukes\u00a0either sooner (if they violate the deal) or later (if they abide by it).\n\nThe deal's supporters probably took comfort believing, just as the concept of\u00a0Mutual Assured Destruction\u00a0(MAD) kept the former Soviet Union and the U.S. from initiating a nuclear attack against each other, the thought of U.S. retaliation would ensure Tehran's mullahs also kept their nukes sheathed. But such comfort dissipates upon heeding the words of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah\u00a0Khomeini, who first put Tehran on the path to obtaining a nuclear arsenal.\n\nKhomeini, whose ultimate goal was for Islam to dominate the world, made it clear he did not fear such retaliation.\u00a0In 1980, he\u00a0said: \"We do not worship Iran, we worship Allah. For patriotism is another name for paganism. I say let this land burn. I say let this land go up in smoke, provided Islam emerges triumphant in the rest of the world.\"\n\nThere should be no doubt, as Iran's spiritual leader, Khomeini was willing to sacrifice the entire country (\"let this land go up in smoke\") if that was the price to pay for Islam to emerge \"triumphant in the rest of the world.\"\n\nAs our media focused public attention on the presidential candidates' personal issues, it left more important issues concerning this national security threat in the shadows.\n\nAgain, there will be supporters of the deal who believe Iran only seeks nukes to be able to respond in an uncertain world. But one need only reflect on Tehran's ever-increasing global aggression to realize what a nuclear-armed Iran is capable of doing.\n\nIn fulfillment of its\u00a0extraterritorial constitutional mandate,\u00a0one totally contrary to any other state's constitution, Iran has been spreading its Islamic Revolution\u00a0throughout\u00a0the Middle East. The mullahs have targeted\u00a0Lebanon, Iraq,\u00a0Syria, Libya,\u00a0Yemen, the\u00a0Palestinian\u00a0territories, and\u00a0Latin America.\n\nEven as nuclear negotiations were ongoing and Obama considered military action against Syria in 2013 for using chemical weapons, Iran brazenly\u00a0threatened\u00a0brutal attacks against Americans and even Obama's family if he did so. Since the 2015 nuclear agreement was reached, the number of U.S. naval confrontations with Iran have\u00a0doubled, accompanied with threats to\u00a0shoot down\u00a0U.S. spy planes in international airspace. Undeterred by international law, Iran most recently\u00a0boasted\u00a0its enemies are not safe \"as the revolutionary forces will chase them and kill them anywhere in the world.\"\n\nA leadership that believes it is faith-bound to establish Islam as the global religion and boasts it is unconstrained by international borders and law to do so is capable of using all means at its disposal to achieve that end. Once it is nuclear armed, we will better understand this.\n\nFor supporters who naively believe the nuclear agreement stopped Iran's nuclear arms program, they not only ignore the\u00a0failure\u00a0of that deal to implement verifiable inspections but also ignore that the mullahs are using North Korea as its research lab for\u00a0nuclear arms\u00a0and\u00a0missile\u00a0development. Despite knowing this was being done, Obama inserted no restrictions upon Tehran in the agreement to continue doing so. Iranian scientists and military observers have always been present at\u00a0Pyongyang's nuclear and missile\u00a0tests. It is absurd to suggest Obama's nuclear deal halted Iran's research.\n\nAdditionally, it later came to light Obama made several \"secret\" sub-deals as part of Iran's nuclear agreement that were not disclosed to Congress at the time. Had their details been shared with Clinton, perhaps we would all know their content now by reading her emails.\n\nAs Clinton has strongly\u00a0endorsed\u00a0Obama's nuclear deal with Iran, it is doubtful she will do anything to deter Iran's march to a weaponization. If four years of a Clinton administration does not see Iran complete that march, eight years definitely will see it become a reality. And a nuclear weapon in Tehran's arsenal will gather no dust. Only two questions will remain at that point: where will it be detonated and what will be the means of delivery?\n\nWhen the big bang is heard, the mullahs will rejoice in Tehran with no fear of facing the consequences of their actions.

The Green Party minister said the piece was \"of great benefit\" to the national debate on censoring \"hate\".\n\nThe letter, penned by Expressen's culture editor Jonas Gardell, says Zuckerberg should feel \"ashamed\", because by allowing people to post links to so-called \"fake\" news on Facebook, the left-leaning social media chief is \"providing liars with a megaphone\".\n\nGardell asserts that \"the whole of Western democracy\" is \"seriously threatened\" and that by allowing users to post things which are \"untrue\", Facebook is complicit in this. He called for Sweden's \"hate speech laws\" to be used more widely and forcefully.\n\nAn example of \"fake news\" cited in the piece is that \"[Hillary] Clinton sold weapons to ISIS\". In actual fact, a report released in November last year confirmed that Hillary Clinton was head of a programme in 2011 in which the U.S. shipped arms to al-Qaeda, much of which ended up later in the hands of Islamic State.\n\nFacebook's decision to not censor links from publications outside the mainstream media could cause the \"free, democratic world as we know it\" to \"go under\" Gardell argues, and points to U.S. voters electing Donald Trump, and voters in Britain opting for Brexit as primary examples of this.\n\nThe gay activist says Trump is \"shameless\", \"wicked\", and \"unhallowed\", alleging this is because he \"unabashedly lies and does not feel guilty about it in the least\". Also included in this category, according to Gardell, are politicians who supported leaving the European Union (EU).\n\nHe writes: \"Take the politicians who advocated Brexit in the UK. Not only did they lie uncontrollably, they also knew that they lied and had absolutely no intention of taking responsibility for the situation when it happened as it happened.\n\n\"If the world is increasingly controlled by people who do not feel shame, it is more important that the rest of us feel ashamed of our inability to prevent their rise to power.\"\n\nGardell has previously bragged live on air that he and his husband have hidden several \"refugees\" in their summer cottage.\n\nBah Kuhnke said the letter drew attention to several challenges to the media landscape, and said that Facebook must take responsibility for content users post, including \"the hatred and lies spread there\".\n\nThe culture minister said she will invite Facebook to Sweden to discuss how to \"move forward\" on the issue of censorship, adding: \"I am convinced that [Facebook] do not want to be an arena for threats, hate and fake news.\"\n\nShe said \"there is a more intensive debate than ever before\" among government ministers, regarding \"hate speech\" and \"fake news\". The minister told Expressen that \"there are many who see that [the amount of \u2018hate speech\u2019 and \u2018fake news\u2019] has crossed a line\" and said she wants Facebook to address this voluntarily.\n\n\"If this approach fails, I'm one of many ministers in the Nordic countries who are prepared to take the next step,\" Bah Kuhnke warned.\n\n\"The next step would be to enact compulsory, binding measures\", she said, insisting that while the government is reluctant to do so, the country \"can't afford to lose to hatred\".\n\nThe unelected executive arm of the EU has threatened to escalate from \"non-legislative\" action if Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube do not censor what it considers \"illegal\" online speech within 24 hours. Speaking on Sunday, the bloc's justice commissioner added \"fake news\" to the list of what they want censored online.\n\nIn May this year the U.S. tech giants signed a \"code of conduct\", promising to work with the Commission and national law enforcement to \"criminalise\" and \"sanction\" \"individual perpetrators\" as well as committing to \"promoting independent counter-narratives\" that the EU favours.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.21500730514526, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 641, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 0.8624393618639999, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 3, "mft_sum": 8, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161207120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.24804992199688, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.7272727272730001}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2016/12/15/bolton-obama-administrations-politicized-intelligence-does-grave-harm-public-confidence-intel-community/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3346, 5987, 6000]}}, "headline": "John Bolton: Obama Administration\u2019s 'Politicized Intelligence' Does 'Grave Harm' to Public Confidence in Intel Community", "wordcount_as_scraped": 971, "date": "20161215200000", "story_content": "On Thursday, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, discussed with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow the Russian election-hacking story and the possibility that it was a \"false flag\" operation.\n\n\"A 'false flag' in intelligence parlance is an operation mounted by a foreign intelligence service where they deliberately leave clues that point to another country,\" Bolton explained. \"In other words, if you're, for example, staging a coup d'etat, you leave weapons and uniforms from a country that supports the incumbent regime, to make it look like it's just an internal battle, rather than the opponents. If it were an American-backed coup, we'd leave AK-47s, in the Cold War days, and Russian uniforms, rather than giving them M-16s and American uniforms. It's something that's intended to show that what looks obvious on the surface may not be the case.\"\n\n\"My question here, which I have not yet heard answered since this first came up over a month before the election, is why the intelligence community \u2013 which disagrees on many, many things \u2013 is so absolutely certain this is the Russians, rather than somebody else,\" he asked. \"Look, I fully believe that Vladimir Putin's Russia is capable and willing to try and disrupt America's elections. I don't have any illusions about them. But I don't see that they've established in public yet, the Obama administration, what the proof of it is.\"\n\n\"If I may just clear up one thing that some in the press deliberately obfuscated, from something I said the other day: I have never believed, never believed, that it was the Obama administration that hacked the DNC, or the RNC, or Podesta. I never said it. I think something I said was confused and distorted, so let me clear that matter up,\" Bolton said.\n\nWhen Marlow proposed that stories about him accusing the Obama administration of running a false flag operation were a prime example of \"fake news,\" Bolton quipped, \"Well, Heaven forbid the media ever engage in that! I just thought it was lazy and incompetent on their part, but you know, I'm just repeating myself. It's par for the course.\"\n\n\"The false flag I was asking about was whether it was another foreign service or someone else,\" he reiterated. \"Now, look, none of us outside the classification system can really say for certain, but I'm just asking why it was so quick in the intelligence services, before the election, not just to leak out, but to say publicly they thought it was the Russians.\" \n\n\"And so I think this is something that congressional committees should look at,\" Bolton advised. \"I think that Mike Pompeo, who I certainly hope will be confirmed as CIA director, will look at it inside the CIA. Let's get this out there because it's corrupting and politicizing the incredibly important work that all intelligence agencies do. If our people lose confidence in them because of yet another episode, under President Obama, of politicizing intelligence, it's going to do us grave harm.\"\n\nMarlow noted that current media coverage of the election-hacking story acts is completely ignorant of the history of politicized intelligence in the Obama administration, as though such skulduggery were\u00a0unheard of since 2009.\n\n\"Yeah, politicization of the intelligence agencies only takes place in Republican administrations. It never takes place under Democrats,\" Bolton said sarcastically. \"This is just another example of the hopeless bias of the mainstream media. I'm afraid \u2013 as I say because I've been, in various government jobs, an avid consumer of intelligence, and I found it incredibly important to enable me to do the various jobs that I've had. So the risk of it being politicized is a most serious risk that all Americans should be concerned about.\"\n\nMarlow pointed out that no actual evidence for the claim of Russian hacking, intended to benefit Donald Trump in the 2016 election, has yet been presented to the public, and the claims leaked to the media by some intelligence officials have been disputed by others.\n\n\"I'm not arguing that, at least in public, any information should be released or declassified that might compromise intelligence sources and methods,\" said Bolton. \"I think that's something we need to be a lot more respectful of than the Obama administration ever was. But I do think when you have senior officials in the intelligence community speaking publicly, that just simply taking what they say on faith is not good enough.\"\n\n\"We had this extraordinary development last night, reported on Fox News, that leaders of four members of the intelligence community had refused to have their surrogates appear at a hearing this morning before the House Intelligence Committee on this subject of Russian hacking,\" he noted. \"It was, I think, DNI, CIA, FBI, and perhaps one other, just refused to show up \u2013 NSA, perhaps \u2013 before Devin Nunes' committee.\" \n\n\"Maybe they're too busy preparing to brief the members of the Electoral College, as a lot of Democrats have been asking for, too,\" he speculated, with another dash of sarcasm. \"I think people should watch how that plays out because it suggests that maybe they don't entirely have their political act together. All the more reason to have them up to testify.\"\n\n\"If I may just say one other thing on that, too: I don't believe intelligence services should put their analyses through a smoothie machine so that they all agree on everything,\" Bolton added. \"I don't think members of Congress, policy makers, and the executive branch of the American public should ever be disturbed if different agencies come to different conclusions. I think they should present their evidence and their arguments to policymakers, and policymakers can then make up their mind who's made the better case.\"\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\u00a0to 9:00 a.m.\u00a0Eastern.\n\nLISTEN:\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.8155338764190696, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 931, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.9708621262400001, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 17, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161215200000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 1.82599355531686, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.54545454545}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/12/09/veterans-new-battlefield-hollywood-film-sets/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [108, 181, 906, 1141, 1163, 1966, 2110, 2221, 3272, 3781, 3830, 4126, 4915, 4954, 5186, 5193, 5291, 5456, 5967, 6128, 6343, 6348, 6508, 6979, 7056, 7191, 7355, 7409, 7605, 7845]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1261, "scraper_regex": 1348}}, "headline": "For Veterans, A New Boot Camp: Hollywood Film Sets", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1348, "date": "20161210040000", "story_content": "Castaic seems an odd sort of town for a movie studio.\n\nAnd\u00a0yet, here it is, situated neatly on Fantastic Lane amongst the fast food\u00a0truck stops in this unincorporated area of Los Angeles County, roughly 50 minutes northwest of the glitz and glamor of the major studios \u2014 a sprawling, four-acre compound with six midsize soundstages, a luxury 50-seat screening room and a fully-equipped post-production suite.\n\nIn the Picture Editorial Lab, a group of about five editors is busy putting together the studio\u2019s latest effort, a bank-heist picture titled Blindsided; in the adjacent editing suite, another team is working on the visual effects for a 90-minute sci-fi actioner called Timepiece.\n\n\u201cCheck this out,\u201d one editor says as he shows off a particularly pretty shot he\u2019s been working on for the latter film, which involves getting the luminous reflection\u00a0off of a car windshield exactly right. \u201cPretty cool, huh?\u201d\n\nInside Stage 4, which doubles as a construction mill, the art department\u2019s Eric Estenzo is hard at work putting the finishing touches on a small, futuristic-looking structure\u00a0that will serve as an\u00a0exit portal of an alien spacecraft once it\u2019s on film. The production needs the set to do last-minute pickup shots on Timepiece.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of ambiguous when you\u2019re reading a script, or a description; you have to have that artistic acumen in developing the world,\u201d Estenzo tells me. \u201cThis is why I like doing this stuff. It serves my imagination well when I can just come up with some ideas, put them on paper, translate them to three dimensions\u2026 and we get something amazing that the actors can work in and the production crew can interact with. That\u2019s exciting for me.\u201d\n\nThe lot looks much like any other movie studio, albeit without the bells and whistles of the majors.\n\nBut the Lifton Institute of Media Arts and Sciences, or LIMS, isn\u2019t really a studio like those studios. It\u2019s a film school. And\u00a0the overwhelming majority of its students are United States military veterans.\n\nFor 12 weeks, veterans come to LIMS to learn the nuts and bolts\u00a0of behind-the-camera filmmaking. There are no classrooms; the students \u2014 around 100 for the current semester \u2014\u00a0are put to work almost immediately on the production of a full-length feature film.\n\nThere are programs for screenwriting; set design and construction; stunt work; cinematography; video and audio editing; film scoring; production management; wardrobe and costuming; hair and makeup; visual effects. The students are broken up into their selective departments and are thrown directly into the day-to-day of filmmaking, with instructors offering lessons and guidance on the go.\n\nThe goal is simple, says Jimmy Lifton, the 61-year-old Emmy-winning film and TV sound engineer who founded LIMS two years ago: get veterans jobs in the entertainment industry.\n\n\u201cI love my fucking guys, man,\u201d Lifton tells me. \u201cNot one of our veteran guys and girls wants a handout. They appreciate that some people want to help them, but what they really want to do is get out there and work and follow their dreams and passions.\u201d\n\nLifton isn\u2019t a veteran himself. Born in Detroit, he went on to snag an apprenticeship as an organist for the Detroit Symphony before attending\u00a0the Berklee School of Music in Boston. After a decade of work in the music business, Lifton co-founded the post-production outfit Oracle Post in 1996, which has done work for most of the Hollywood majors; he\u2019s also won two daytime Emmys for his sound editing, for the animated series The Penguins of Madagascar and Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness. He\u2019s also been nominated twice for SpongeBob SquarePants.\n\nIn 2009, he founded the Lifton Institute of Media Skills in Detroit to capitalize on Michigan\u2019s\u00a0ambitious film incentive program, but the school\u00a0was forced to relocate when the state rolled the program back.\n\n\u201cWhen I went to the Detroit area, we ended up training some fantastic people; out of work auto employees, including some veterans,\u201d he explains. \u201cAll the people we worked with were great, but the veterans were outstanding.\u201d\n\nLifton\u00a0went almost entirely out of his own pocket on the construction of the LIMS studio in Castaic. About 18 months after its opening, the school has trained more than 200 veterans, with roughly 80 percent going on to get jobs in Hollywood (LIMS was recently awarded for 100 percent job placement in its most recent graduating class).\n\nThe school receives some of the funding for its veterans programs from L.A. City and County WorkSource grants and other local programs, and also rents its studio and its employees out to established production outfits. Netflix recently used several soundstages to shoot the second season of its show Flaked, starring Will Arnett.\n\nFor some, including the art department\u2019s Estenzo, who served in the Marine Corps., the training method at LIMS isn\u2019t dissimilar\u00a0from the training methods they\u2019ve used\u00a0in the military, albeit with a different set of risks involved.\n\n\u201cThe military is fond of adaptive learning, this idea of being thrown into a situation where you don\u2019t have all of the answers,\u201d Estenzo says in a pause while working\u00a0on his\u00a0alien spacecraft. \u201cWhen you\u2019re out there on the spot, you\u2019re doing and you\u2019re learning and you\u2019re\u00a0correcting as you go. And I think that\u2019s similar to what LIMS teaches here, and I think that\u2019s really a strong point.\u201d\n\nNone of the veterans I interview speak badly\u00a0about the Department of Veterans Affairs, despite the horror stories of long wait times and mismanagement that have made headlines around the country in the past few years.\n\n\u201cAs far as the VA goes, let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s gonna be hit or miss,\u201d says John A. Rizzi, an Air Force veteran from nearby Valencia who studied production management at LIMS. \u201cYes, the wait times are long, but\u2026 it\u2019s the government.\u201d\n\nRizzi notes that LIMS has just been added to the VA\u2019s list of approved programs.\n\n\u201cWhen I went in the VA,\u00a0they didn\u2019t really know about this place,\u201d he tells me. \u201cHopefully it\u2019ll open the door for more veterans looking for an education.\u201d\n\nFormer students have filled\u00a0the LIMS website with positive testimonials, with many having said they received industry jobs just a few weeks after getting into the job market.\n\nFor some, the school represents much more than a training program.\u00a0In a\u00a0recent Facebook post, Army veteran Sgt. Scott Vasquez, a graduate of the school\u2019s stunt program, wrote that LIMS had changed his life after he\u2019d struggled with\u00a0depression and unemployment.\n\n\n\n\u201cI thought it was a scam,\u201d he recalled of an early tour of the facility. \u201cNow, after 512 hours of training, I have found new lifetime friends, camaraderie and a support team that goes deeper than I ever could have imagined. They provided transportation to get [to the studio] and back. When you\u2019re broke it helps. I\u2019ve seen this place put vets to work off the street with my own eyes.\u201d\n\nFor Lifton, it\u2019s all about the training. The movies\u00a0look good, but that\u2019s almost beside the point. He admits he doesn\u2019t yet have\u00a0plans for what to do with the completed films; maybe they\u2019ll be entered into film festivals.\n\nMeanwhile, he\u2019s focused on expanding his\u00a0fledgeling school. Lifton wants to build a dormitory on the lot to house some students, particularly the homeless veterans who attend the program. He also wants to\u00a0increase the class size to 300 students per semester.\u00a0This year\u2019s VET 200 will expand the program to include post-9/11 veterans.\n\nLifton\u2019s also excited to start pre-production for the upcoming semester\u2019s project, an anthology film tentatively titled\u00a0Casket Lake.\n\n\u201cThey don't stop until the job gets done,\u201d Lifton says of his guys. \u201cIf something breaks, they don't sit there and worry about it. They fix it or work around it. And that's a perfect movie crew member. That's what they do.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nFollow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 14, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.1088011264801, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1261, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.0061935521, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 18, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161210040000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.4274385408406, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.63636363636}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/11/07/jeff-sessions-obama-must-make-crystal-clear-only-citizens-can-vote-in-u-s-elections/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [598, 1466, 1526, 1647, 2366, 3098]}}, "headline": "Jeff Sessions: Obama Must \u2018Make Crystal Clear\u2019 Only Citizens Can Vote in U.S. Elections", "wordcount_as_scraped": 674, "date": "20161107160000", "story_content": "Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions is condemning President Obama\u2019s refusal to state that illegal aliens are not permitted to vote in U.S. elections.\n\nA Latino Youtube host interviewed Obama Friday, asking him: \"Many of the millennials, DREAMers, undocumented, um, citizens\u2014and I call them citizens because they contribute to this country\u2014are fearful of voting. So if I vote, will immigration know where I live? Will they come for my family and deport us?\"\n\n\"Not true,\" Obama replied, ignoring her point about\u00a0illegal aliens voting.\n\nAnd the reason is, first of all, when you vote, you are a citizen yourself\u2014and there is not a situation where the voting rolls somehow are transferred over and people start investigating et cetera. The sanctity of the vote is strictly confidential in terms of who you voted for. If you have a family member who maybe is undocumented, then you have an even greater reason to vote.\n\nObama\u2019s reply was clumsily worded, but he appeared to say that if a U.S. citizen with illegal alien family members who continue to stay in the U.S. in defiance of the law votes, immigration authorities will not use that voters\u2019 information to begin deportation proceedings against their illegal alien relatives. \n\nGiven Obama\u2019s strange wording, however, it\u2019s open to interpretation whether or not he is suggesting an illegal alien is considered a \u201ccitizen\u201d if he\u00a0manages to make it into a voting booth. In that case, Obama\u00a0is plainly hinting voter fraud perpetrated by illegal aliens in the 2016 presidential election will not be investigated.\u00a0\n\n\"I am shocked that the President of the United States\u2014who is the chief law enforcement officer for the nation and to whom all federal law enforcement officers report\u2014failed to strongly and immediately object to a statement by an interviewer that unlawful immigrants can and should vote in U.S. elections,\u201d Sessions said in a statement. \u201cThe interviewer proposed a radical and illegal action, which the President had a duty to condemn.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President must immediately issue a statement to make crystal clear that only citizens of the United States have the right to vote, and that any noncitizen who votes, and anyone who assists noncitizens to vote, does so illegally and is subject to prosecution,\u201d he continued. \u00a0\u201cThe failure to clarify this statement will only add further credibility to the public's concerns about the integrity of this election.\u201d\n\nSessions is far from the only figure to denounce Obama\u2019s strange and ambiguous nod towards illegal voting: Fox Business host said the president is \u201cadvocating an illegal act\u201d and former Arizona Republican Gov. Jan Brewer called his words \u201cabsolutely shocking.\u201d\n\nIllegal aliens voting unlawfully in U.S. elections and disenfranchising Americans is a far bigger threat than voting machines miscounting ballots, one legal expert told Breitbart News on Thursday.\n\n\"I just sued two Virginia counties this week for concealing alien voting records, the list of foreigners who are on the voter rolls,\u201d\u00a0said J. Christian Adams on Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM. \u201cIn Virginia alone, our litigation found a thousand aliens in just eight counties. These are the only eight counties that complied with our document requests. And they were voting! So if you take a thousand aliens who were accidentally caught in eight Virginia counties, and there's 135 Virginia counties, that tells you that the number of aliens on the voter rolls in just this swing state is in the five figures.\"\n\n\"The same is true in Colorado, Florida, North Carolina, Arizona,\" he continued. \"More so in Texas, Pennsylvania. These are places where alien voting will make a difference. And it made a difference in California. California became the deepest shade of blue, in part, because of problems with the voter rolls, with illegal alien voting.\"\n\n\"We have a blind spot,\" Adams added. \"I don't think Republicans are aware of this problem to the degree they need to be. Some of them are. Most aren't. There are very few tools, and the Obama administration has been blocking the use of those tools.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 14, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.5653371810913095, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 661, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.230936828440001, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 34, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161107160000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.0909090909099994, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 5.14372163388805, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/12/11/glenn-beck-and-samantha-bee-bond-over-their-fear-and-loathing-of-trump/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1785, 3062, 4024, 5634, 5901, 6521, 6567, 6579, 6590, 6609, 6621, 6670, 6749, 6794, 7563]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1178, "scraper_regex": 1304}}, "headline": "Glenn Beck and Samantha Bee Bond Over Their Fear and Loathing of Trump", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1304, "date": "20161211230000", "story_content": "TheBlaze founder Glenn Beck interviewed Full Frontal host Samantha Bee on his show Thursday as the first part in an effort between the rightwing talker and the leftwing comedian to find common ground.\n\n\u201cWe're doing a piece with Glenn,\u201d Bee said. \u201cAnd so you [Beck] generously invited me to be on your show. We are merging worlds in a way.\u201d\n\nBeck and Bee \u2014 both vociferous critics of President-elect Donald Trump from the right and the left, respectively \u2014 bonded over their mutual distress at the election outcome, the dangers of \"fake news,\" and their desire to \"stand up for people who are imperiled\" now that Trump won.\n\nWhile they both conceded that there are \"many things\" they don't agree on, Bee said, \"It's okay with us to agree with each other on some things. I feel like there's a shared humanity, right?\"\n\nBeck agreed and complimented Bee's humor, saying that he finds her \u201cvery, very funny.\u201d\n\nBeck suggested that the way he responded to Barack Obama's victory in 2008 was comparable to Bee's response to Trump's election.\n\n\"Does it bother to you that we seem to be playing musical chairs, that under the last president I was freaked out and thinking, 'Oh, my gosh.' And now, under this president, you're saying, 'Oh, my gosh,'\" he asked.\n\n\"Well, it's not just me saying it. There are a lot more people,\" she replied.\n\n\"I'm saying it as well!\" Beck said, quick to add himself to the list of people disturbed by Trump.\n\nBeck explained that he doesn't believe any leader should \"ever make you feel that way.\"\n\n\"No man should have so much power that he can reach into your life and change our culture and change everything,\" he said.\n\n\"I guess fundamentally I don't really trust anyone,\" Bee replied, saying\u00a0that she doesn't see presidents as \"messianic figures.\"\n\n\"I just don't think that any one person or leader is going to be everything to everybody. And, you know, the pendulum swings,\" she said.\n\nBee, who is from Canada, noted, \"I think what we're going through right now feels very different to me, in my experience, which is limited because, remember, I'm an immigrant. And this is the first election that I was able to vote in.\"\n\nBeck suggested that the Bill of Rights is the one thing \"they could unite on.\"\n\n\"I was dumb enough in 2003 to go, 'Oh, George Bush, he'd never misuse the Patriot Act.' By 2006, I'm like, 'Oh, my gosh, how stupid was I,'\" Beck said.\n\n\"The people on the left were right there,\" he continued. \"And the reason why a lot of us didn't listen to that warning was because, 'You're just the other side. You're just against George Bush.' Oh, my God, shut up. And now, under Barack Obama, it expanded and got worse. And under this guy [Trump], it's going to expand and get even worse.\u201d\n\nBee explained, \"Part of the reason why we're here today is because I do think that it's important for us to kind of redraw the lines a little bit. I don't think that it's as clear-cut as left and right or liberal and conservative anymore.\"\n\nShe continued:\n\nI feel like\u00a0you need to form alliances in a different way now. I think that, you know, there are things that are imperiled now, or certainly there feels like there's an urgency and there feels like there's violence in the air to me. And I think that it's going to be more important than ever for people to kind of reach into areas where they wouldn't necessarily feel comfortable and hold hands with people in a different way.\n\nThey both agreed that while it's important to engage in \"civil discourse\" and \"speak nice\" and \"listen to each other,\" that isn't enough.\n\n\u201cCivil discourse is really, for me, just the beginning of change,\u201d Bee explained and Beck agreed.\n\n\u201cThere's an action moment too, where you have to defend people\" she continued. \"You have to stand up for people who are imperiled in this new world. You have to take action. I don't know what the action moment is. We do have to find it.\u201d\n\nBeck said that when the time comes, the left and the right will have\u00a0to \u201cstand on common principles.\u201d\n\nHe lamented, \"No one wants to talk about common principles. Everybody is talking about policies. And that's been our problem \u2014 that's been my problem. I wanted you here because I think you felt \u2014 you feel right now like I felt \u2014 not in '08, but in '12.\"\n\nHe explained that after the 2012 election, he was astonished that people re-elected Obama despite all of the information available showing how unacceptable he was.\n\n\"And you feel that way now about Donald Trump. So do I,\" Beck said and Bee agreed. \"You kind of lost faith in, 'Crap, it's not just the president, it's the people around me too. I don't understand how they're disconnecting from truth. They're just accepting it.'\"\n\n\u201cSo my question is: How do we take on \u2014 how do you take on your side and say, You know what, there are some things that \u2014 lying about Benghazi did matter. It did matter,\" Beck asked.\n\n\u201cThere are consequences to lies. I think we are seeing that,\u201d Bee responded.\n\n\u201cThere are just false narratives,\" she explained. \"I mean, we've all been talking about fake news. We were talking about it on the show the other night. There's so much distrust.\"\n\n\"People are receiving their news in their own bubble of the internet,\u201d Bee said, as Beck nodded in agreement. \u201cIt's very difficult to penetrate that with actual information.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn both sides,\u201d Beck interjected.\n\n\"I agree,\" Bee said.\n\n\"We're self-selecting out,\" Beck added.\n\n\u201cWell, of course,\" Bee agreed, adding: \"I don't really know how to penetrate that. I don't think anybody really does.\"\n\n\"But that's what we're here for,\" Beck offered.\n\nShe\u00a0agreed, \"That is why we need to be so vigilant and so diligent and do things in a different way and take ownership of those.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe're going to spend some more time together,\u201d Beck said, getting back to their collaborative project. \u201cI'm doing something for your show.\u00a0And then we're going to spend some time on Facebook.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's going to be delightful,\u201d Bee said.\n\nThe call for civil discourse, speaking \"nice\" to each other, and \"hold[ing] hands with people in a different way\" is a striking departure from the tone these hosts took during and immediately after the election.\n\nThe day after Trump's victory, Bee claimed on her show that \"white people\" \"ruined America\" by voting for Trump. This was in keeping with her penchant during the campaign of smearing Trump's supporters as racists.\n\nBeck, for his part, has been unrivaled in his invective against Trump. During the campaign, he\u00a0regularly described the New York builder as a\u00a0Hitler-like\u00a0psychopath\u00a0with supporters he\u00a0compared to\u00a0Nazi Brownshirts.\n\nThe former radio shock jock's\u00a0disdain for Trump reached a crescendo in April when he donned swim goggles and\u00a0rubbed his face in a bowl of crushed Cheetos\u00a0to see if he could \"look like Donald Trump.\"\n\nBeck's interview with Bee seems to be the latest example of his recent rapprochement with liberals. In October, he was featured in a flattering profile in Rolling Stone magazine. In early November, a New Yorker profile of Beck explained that he had \"rethought some things\" after listening to a recent speech by Michelle Obama that he praised as \"the most effective political speech I have heard since Ronald Reagan.\" The article described Beck as a \"Black Lives Matter supporter\" and quoted him praising the president he once harshly criticized, declaring that Barack Obama made him \"a better man.\"\n\nListen to the full audio of Beck and Bee's interview below.

Andrew Byers, 30, of Rolesville, NC, and Sgt. 1st Class Ryan Gloyer, 34, of Greenville, PA, adding that they died on Thursday \u201cof wounds sustained while engaging enemy forces.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News has learned that the U.S. military is only allowed to shoot at the Taliban in self-defense and when assisting Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) during combat. American forces lack the authority to offensively attack the terrorists.\n\n\"Two U.S. service members died [on Thursday] as a result of wounds sustained during operations in Kunduz district, Kunduz province today. Two other U.S. service members were wounded in the operation,\" noted the U.S.-NATO mission in Afghanistan in a\u00a0statement.\n\n\u201cThe service members came under fire during a train, advise and assist mission with our Afghan partners to clear a Taliban position and disrupt the group\u2019s operations in Kunduz district,\u201d it adds.\n\nAccording to a Breitbart News analysis of Pentagon data, the majority (1,686), or about 75 percent, of the total 2,244 U.S. military deaths during the ongoing Afghanistan war have occurred since the U.S. government inaugurated Barack Obama as president for his first term in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, nearly 90 percent (17,477) of the total number of reported injuries (20,179) have taken place under Obama's watch.\n\nAlthough the Obama administration has repeatedly argued since the end of 2014 that the U.S. military is no longer engaged in combat operations in Afghanistan, assessments by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), a U.S. watchdog agency, have determined that the U.S. combat mission continues.\n\nSo far this year, members of the U.S.-trained and funded ANDSF, which includes police and military units, have killed\u00a0more American troops\u00a0than the resilient Taliban. Such incidents are considered insider, or \"green on blue,\" attacks.\n\nThe latest U.S. military casualties come as security conditions continue to deteriorate across Afghanistan.\n\nIn its most recent quarterly report to Congress, SIGAR reveals that the U.S.-backed Afghan government has lost territory to terrorists in the country, primarily to the Taliban, which is believed to control more land now than at any time since the American forces dethroned the terrorist group in 2001.\n\nAmerican Gen. John Nicholson, the top commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, said:\n\nOn behalf of all U.S. Forces \u2013 Afghanistan, today\u2019s loss is heartbreaking and we offer our deepest condolences to the families and friends of our service members who lost their lives today. Our wounded soldiers are receiving the best medical care possible and we are keeping them and their families in our thoughts today, as well. Despite today\u2019s tragic event, we are steadfast in our commitment to help our Afghan partners defend their nation.\n\nCiting the U.S. Forces in Afghanistan (USFOR-A), SIGAR reports that more than one-third (149) of the 407 districts across Afghanistan\u2019s 34 provinces are either under the control (8) or influence (25) of terrorist groups or at risk (116) of coming under it.\n\nSo far this year, a total of seven U.S. troops have perished in Afghanistan, including one who died of a non-combat related injury in Kandahar, shows the Breitbart News analysis.\n\nOf the remaining six Americans who have been killed in action, Afghan troops have killed three, the Taliban two, and the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) branch in the region has killed one American.\n\nThe Breitbart News analysis of Pentagon data reveals that American military fatalities have more than quadrupled under Obama's watch, from 558 before he became president to 2,244 now.\n\nData from SIGAR and the Pentagon shows that at least an additional 10 U.S. civilians or contractors been killed during combat operations in Afghanistan, and another two have died in non-combat related incidents, since the war started in October 2001.\n\nMoreover, at least nine American civilians or contractors have been wounded during the war.\n\nOf the 407 districts within the 34 provinces in Afghanistan, 37 percent (149) have been deemed by the U.S. military to be under the control or influence of terrorists, primarily the Taliban, or \"contested\" which refers to districts that have a \"negligible meaningful impact from insurgents,\" notes the watchdog agency,\" notes SIGAR.\n\nThat means the U.S.-backed government only controls (88) or influences (170) about 63 percent of the country's districts, marking a decrease from the 66 percent reported as of the end of May.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.682867527008059, "HarmVice": 19, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 740, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.52679423766, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 7, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 19, "mft_sum": 44, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161105200000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 4.0, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 5.945945945945951, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/01/02/establishment-republicans-anchored-states-common-core/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [7117]}}, "headline": "How Establishment Republicans Anchored States to Common Core", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1177, "date": "20170104060000", "story_content": "Establishment Republican politicians have boasted the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) prohibits the U.S. secretary of education from coercing states into adopting the Common Core standards.\n\nHowever, many who have studied the law say not only is that claim unfounded, but also that ESSA actually imposes Common Core on the entire country.\n\nIn December of 2015, Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, touted that he and Democrat Sen. Patty Murray (WA) had facilitated the \"bipartisan\" passage of the ESSA measure that would replace the George W. Bush-era No Child Left Behind (NCLB). President Barack Obama signed the bill into law almost immediately, referring to it as a \"Christmas miracle.\"\n\n\"We have reversed the trend toward a national school board, repealed the federal Common Core mandate, and enacted what the Wall Street Journal called 'the largest devolution of federal control to states in a quarter century,\" Alexander said.\n\nA statement on Sen. Richard Burr's (R-NC) website following the signing of ESSA into law also said the measure had succeeded at \"repealing the common core mandate.\"\n\n\"This is a big deal,\" Burr said about the new law. \"It will bring an additional $24 million per year in funding to poorest children in North Carolina and put a stop to the Common Core mandate.\"\n\nRepublicans based their pronouncements on the portion of ESSA that states, \"The federal government is prohibited from \u2026 Mandating, directing, controlling, coercing, or exercising any direction or supervision over academic standards that states develop or adopt, including Common Core State Standards.\"\n\nParent activists and education scholars who have studied the law, however, assert ESSA neither repeals the Common Core mandate, nor prohibits the education secretary from coercing states into adopting the standards. In fact, those who have been battling against the Common Core in the states say ESSA actually does the opposite: it keeps states anchored to the controversial education reform.\n\n\"Within the other 1,060 pages of ESSA lurk the provisions that will keep states in Common Core, or something that looks very much like Common Core,\" American Principles Project (APP) education fellow Jane Robbins and Indiana parent activist Erin Tuttle wrote at The Pulse 2016. \"The Secretary won't have to mandate anything, because the other parts of the bill contain the requirements for \u2026 \u2018high standards,'\" a phrase that has come to refer to Common Core.\n\nFor example, while NCLB never dictated any state alignment for academic standards, ESSA requires every state to submit its plan for standards for approval to the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nRobbins and Tuttle assert:\n\nThat plan must be \"coordinated\" with 11 federal statutes, including the Soviet-style Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act passed a year ago; the Education Sciences Reform Act, which is all about collecting student data for research; the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act, which adds to the Head Start requirements on preschool standards; and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) Authorization Act, which governs the NAEP test that will almost certainly be aligned to Common Core to hide the fact that Common Core-trained students perform poorly on NAEP. Requiring state plans and therefore state standards to coordinate with all these federal statutes means, as a practical matter, states will keep Common Core.\n\n\"ESSA, which replaces NCLB, does mandate alignment,\" write Robbins and Tuttle, quoting the ESSA law and translating the Common Core rhetoric:\n\n\"Each State shall demonstrate that the challenging academic standards are aligned with entrance requirements for credit-bearing coursework in the system of public higher education in the State and relevant State career and technical education standards.\" This is simply another way of saying states must have \"college- and career-ready\" standards. And as made clear by the U.S. Department of Education's own materials, \"college- and career-ready\" means Common Core.\n\n\"High standards\" and \"accountability\" are also among the primary \"buzzwords\" associated with Common Core. Upon her nomination to the position of U.S. education secretary, Betsy DeVos immediately posted to a new website about Common Core: \"Certainly. I am not a supporter\u2014period. I do support high standards, strong accountability, and local control.\"\n\nEstablishment Republicans have learned not to use Common Core's \"toxic\" name. As a result, many state legislatures have simply \"rebranded\" or renamed the Common Core standards with local flavor names. The standards themselves, however, remain relatively unchanged, save for a few tweaks.\n\nAPP's education director Emmett McGroarty wrote at The Pulse 2016 following the approval of ESSA, \"Anti-Common Core activists tried for months to warn Congress that the new federal education bill \u2026 was a disaster that would cement, not overturn, the odious progressive-education philosophies of the Obama Administration.\"\n\n\"Now comes confirmation that the activists were dead on \u2014 and that Republican leadership, including Sen. Lamar Alexander, Rep. John Kline, and House Speaker Paul Ryan, carried out a cynical scheme to betray their constituents and give the Administration everything it wanted,\" McGroarty continued, citing a Politico Pro interview with former Education Secretary Arne Duncan:\n\nDuncan expressed joyful incredulity at how wonderful ESSA turned out to be from the Administration's point of view (meaning, how bad it is for children, families, and the Constitution). \"I'm stunned,\" he said, \"at how much better it ended up than either [House or Senate] bill going into conference. I had a Democratic congressman say to me that it's a miracle \u2014 he's literally never seen anything like it.\"\n\n\"[I]f you look at the substance of what is there \u2026 embedded in the law are the values that we've promoted and proposed forever,\" Duncan continued. \"The core of our agenda from Day One, that's all in there \u2013 early childhood, high standards [i.e., Common Core], not turning a blind eye when things are bad.

They should be asked why they refuse to live under it.\n\nAfter they spend 800 hours changing insurance plans every year, ending up with increasingly expensive and increasingly useless plans \u2014 all so that their premiums can pay for the poor \u2014 I\u2019ll be fascinated to hear about their love for the downtrodden.\n\nSame with Republicans who are, once again, being bamboozled by lobbyists, to the detriment of their taxpaying constituents who don\u2019t have time or money to fly to Washington and tell them our hard-luck stories.\n\nInsurance lobbyists have somehow convinced politicians, who have very little experience in the private sector, that health insurance is wildly different from every other product \u2014 even car insurance and homeowner\u2019s insurance \u2014 because of its need for a large pool of enrollees.\n\nEveryone talks about the enrollment problem as if this is a bug unique to the health insurance industry. What product, do they imagine, does not need lots of customers?\n\nHow could restaurants afford those chefs, fresh flowers, industrial kitchens, one hundred sets of plates, napkins and silverware and a staff of waiters \u2014 without customers? AHHHH! THEY\u2019LL GO OUT OF BUSINESS!!! THE MODEL DOESN\u2019T WORK WITHOUT LOTS OF PARTICIPANTS! CONGRESS MUST GET INVOLVED.\n\nPublishers couldn\u2019t have editors, proofreaders, lawyers, paper plants and marketing departments \u2014 unless there\u2019s a large pool of book buyers. Pipe manufacturers couldn\u2019t have hundreds of employees, huge machines and factories unless \u2014 you get the idea.\n\nWhy is \u201chaving customers\u201d treated like some freakish need of this one industry?\n\nPeople are a lot less interested in buying hotel rooms, restaurant meals and pipes than they are in buying health insurance. Everyone knows someone who has died of cancer or had some other major medical problem, and most people are not insane.\n\nEven with the hell of Obamacare, requiring hundreds of hours of work \u2014 to research, sign up for, be thrown off of, then sign up for a different, ever-more-expensive plan, year after year \u2014 the long-suffering taxpayer is doing all that in order to maintain some form of health insurance.\n\nSo apparently, no matter how awful you make it, this is a product Americans are desperate to buy!\n\nRepublicans all say they want to save the so-called \u201cgood parts\u201d of Obamacare. Because who knows better what the American consumer wants than a member of Congress!\n\nI keep imagining Congress designing a \u201ccomprehensive hotel reform bill,\u201d promising to save the popular parts: \u201cBUT PEOPLE LIKE HAVING TV\u2019S IN THEIR HOTEL ROOMS!\u201d How could we ever get TVs in hotel rooms without Congress writing a law?\n\nIt turns out, people running a business have an uncanny ability to figure out what\u2019s popular with their customers.\n\nAny \u201cpopular\u201d features of Obamacare obviously, manifestly, inevitably will be preserved by the free market. If parents like keeping their useless millennial kids on their plans, guess what? Any insurance company forced to compete with other insurance companies WILL OFFER THAT.\n\nAs for covering people with \u201cpre-existing conditions\u201d \u2014 there are pre-existing conditions and pre-existing conditions. Does this mean the unfortunate few with some exorbitantly expensive medical problem? Or does it mean people who have a \u201cpre-existing condition\u201d because they waited to be diagnosed with cancer before buying insurance?\n\nThe first category of people was dealt a bad hand. Eventually, they will be taken care of by the market when excess coverage policies are common and reinsurance companies pop up to cover the primary insurance companies.\n\nUntil then, a separate program can pay for the unlucky. That\u2019s not a reason to wreck the health insurance market for everyone else. There aren\u2019t 22 million people with horrifyingly expensive medical conditions. They\u2019re being used as the baby seals to sell subsidized health care for the irresponsible.\n\nThe second category is a lot less sympathetic, which is precisely why the two cases are always conflated. You can\u2019t buy flood insurance after your house has already floated away.\n\nBut we won\u2019t let people die in the streets, so \u2014 as Trump said at the very first GOP debate \u2014 they will be dealt with \u201cthrough a different system.\u201d They probably can\u2019t go to Sloan Kettering, but then again, neither can I. Right now, my $700 a month pays for\u00a0them\u00a0to go to Sloan Kettering.\n\nBoth cases are of zero practical importance to the vast majority of people who just want to buy health insurance on the free market, rather than what we\u2019re doing now, which is giving shiftless layabouts and irresponsible screw-offs an unlimited health care credit card \u2014 paid for through our insurance premiums.\n\nWe\u2019d come to Washington and tell you that, but we\u2019re working to pay for the pediatric dental care of illegal aliens.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.62748646736145, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 986, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.06505758029, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170126050000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.12981744421907, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/12/28/netanyahu-slams-john-kerry-biased-speech-israel/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [402, 414, 855, 1070, 1277, 1371, 1388, 1498, 1561, 2155, 2467, 3417, 3442, 3456]}}, "headline": "Netanyahu Slams John Kerry For 'Biased Speech Against Israel'", "wordcount_as_scraped": 507, "date": "20161229010000", "story_content": "TEL AVIV \u2014 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office slammed Wednesday's Middle East policy speech by lame-duck Secretary of State John Kerry as \"biased\" against Israel while charging Kerry \"dealt obsessively\" with the issue of settlements, meaning Israeli communities in the West Bank and eastern sections of Jerusalem.\n\nNetanyahu's office\u00a0distributed\u00a0the following statement to media outlets, including Breitbart Jerusalem:\n\n\"Like the resolution that John Kerry advanced at the UN [Security Council.

(AP) \u2014 Repealing North Carolina\u2019s law limiting LGBT protections at the close of a bitter election year was supposed to heal blows to the economy and perhaps open a truce in the culture wars in at least one corner of the divided United States.\n\nThe failure of state lawmakers to follow through instead shows how much faith each side has lost in the other, as Americans segregate themselves into communities of us and them, defined by legislative districts that make compromise unlikely.\n\nThe deal was supposedly reached with input from top politicians and industry leaders: Charlotte agreed to eliminate its anti-discrimination ordinance on the condition that state lawmakers then repeal the legislation known as House Bill 2, which had been a response to Charlotte\u2019s action.\n\nBut bipartisan efforts to return both the city and state to a more harmonious past fell apart amid mutual distrust, and neither side seemed to worry about retribution in the next election.\n\nWith GOP map-drawers drawing most legislative districts to be uncompetitively red or blue, politicians see little downside to avoiding a negotiated middle-ground. And since the day Republicans passed and signed it into law last March, HB2 has reflected these broad divisions in society.\n\nThe failed repeal shows the same polarization, said David Lublin, a Southern politics expert in American University\u2019s School of Public Affairs.\n\nNorth Carolina had been \u201cseen as the forefront of the new South,\u201d focusing on education and economic development, and wasn\u2019t \u201cviewed as crazy-right wing or crazy-left wing,\u201d Lublin said. Keeping the law in effect, he said, \u201creverses that impression.\u201d\n\nIt was always more than just a \u201cbathroom bill.\u201d\n\nRepublican lawmakers commanding veto-proof majorities framed HB2 as a rebuke to the values of Charlotte and other urban, white-collar communities where Democrats are clustered and where gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people generally find support.\n\nHB2 \u2014 which omits these people from state anti-discrimination protections, bars local governments from protecting them with their own ordinances, and orders transgender people to use facilities that match their birth certificates \u2014 created a backlash that has cost the state\u2019s economy millions.\n\nCorporations, entertainers and high-profile sporting events backed out to avoid being seen as endorsing discrimination. Two-thirds of North Carolina voters surveyed in November\u2019s Associated Press exit poll said they oppose the law, and even Trump\u2019s supporters narrowly trended against it.\n\nIBM executives worry that the failure to repeal HB2 is an obstacle to attracting the best employees to its largest North American operation, in Research Triangle Park outside Raleigh, home to an outsized number of college graduates from around the world.\n\n\u201cThe state of North Carolina has a tremendous amount to do to recover its reputation as a great place to live, work and do business,\u201d IBM chief diversity officer Lindsey-Rae McIntyre said in an interview Thursday. \u201cOur position is that we will fight this, that we are deeply committed to hiring the very best, diverse talents and that this law and this mindset does nothing to fuel our commitment to hiring that talent.\u201d\n\nAcross the divide, supporters of HB2 express anger against what they feel are challenges to their religious freedoms, and fear that women could be endangered by transgender people in public bathrooms and showers.\n\n\u201cAs much as North Carolina\u2019s \u2018reputation\u2019 may have been harmed in the eyes of some, just as many \u2014 if not more \u2014 respected us for the stance we took in support of privacy and security protections of our public restrooms and dressing facilities,\u201d said GOP state Rep. Chris Millis, whose district covers all or parts of two largely rural, coastal counties where President-elect Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton by a margin of more than 2-to-1.\n\nThe divide cuts both ways in the legislature.\n\nRep. Cecil Brockman represents a heavily Democratic district in urban Guilford County, where voters chose Barack Obama over Mitt Romney in 2012 by nearly a 4-to-1 margin. Brockman, who publicly identifies as bisexual, pleaded with his colleagues to repeal what he called an \u201coffensive, disastrous\u201d law.\n\nBrockman\u2019s district is about to change.\n\nAfter Republicans were accused of unlawfully clustering black voters to diminish their influence, a federal court panel ruled that about a sixth of the state\u2019s 170 legislative districts were illegally drawn. The judges ordered North Carolina lawmakers to redraw districts by March 15 and to hold new elections in November.\n\nIf lawmakers don\u2019t resolve it somehow, HB2 is likely to be a hot-button issue in those elections, although even the most one-sided districts are unlikely to change enough to unseat Republican majorities in the evenly divided state.\n\nPolls show Republican Gov. Pat McCrory\u2019s support for the law played into his loss \u2014 by about 10,000 votes out of 4.7 million cast \u2014 to Democratic Gov.-elect Roy Cooper, who ran in part on repealing HB2.\n\nRepublican legislative leaders and Cooper, who appears to have had a significant role in brokering the deal that ultimately collapsed, are still hopeful that a solution can be reached in 2017. The General Assembly, with newcomers elected last month, begins in less than three weeks.\n\n\u201cI certainly believe that negotiations will resume, and frankly we all know that we have to work through this,\u201d House Speaker Tim Moore told the AP in a phone interview Thursday, but \u201can issue with strong social overtones is always a problematic vote for members.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Gary D.

However, there are numerous other ethnic militias, including vigilante groups made up of nomadic, predominantly Muslim Fulani herders, as well as others specializing in highway robbery. All of these groups have been guilty of massacres, rapes, scorched earth attacks, and other atrocities, often in revenge for similar attacks by a militia on the other side.\n\nOne of the Muslim Fulani herder groups, the Peul tribe, has emerged as a relatively new militia group inflicting horrors on civilians in the northwest of CAR, particularly near the borders of Cameroon and Chad. Although they have been mainly allied with the Muslim S\u00e9l\u00e9ka militias, fighting against the Christian anti-Balakas, they also claim on occasion to have fought against S\u00e9l\u00e9ka militias for the protection of their own Peul tribe.\n\nThe Peul armed militia is calling itself \u201cReturn, Reclamation, Rehabilitation\u201d or \u201c3R\u201d. The group appeared in December 2015, and throughout 2016 they burned down villages, causing tens of thousands of civilians to lose their homes. They have killed and raped civilians, and committed other atrocities.\n\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) conducted interviews in November, and documented numerous atrocities and murders. One 30-year-old woman said that 3R fighters broke into her home:\n\nOne said, \"Where is your husband?\" I said that he was not there\u2026 One of them cocked his gun and pointed it at me and said, \"We are going to have sex with you.\" He threw me on the ground and [one of them] raped me. Another was waiting for his turn, but there was shooting outside while the first one was finishing, so when he was done they both left. \u2026 [M]y two younger children were right beside me, crying.\n\nI wish that I could tell you, Dear Reader, that this kind of atrocity was rare, but it is common fare during a generational crisis war, such as the war in Central African Republic. Rape and extermination of opponents is part of the human DNA, and all people of all races and religions are susceptible, often in a cycle of escalating tit-for-tat revenge. Human Rights Watch and Reuters\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCentral African Republic crisis war continues to spin out of control\n\nOn Wednesday, a convoy of United Nations peacekeepers in Central African Republic near the Cameroon border was attacked unknown assailants who killed two Moroccan peacekeepers and then escaped. It\u2019s not known whether the attackers were from the 3R militias, but this attack shows that the UN peacekeepers have almost no control in the country outside the capital city Bangui.\n\nA month ago, Ban Ki-moon, the outgoing Secretary-General of the United Nations, said that he was \u201cdeeply concerned over renewed violence last week in the Central African Republic.\u201d A UN Special Adviser Adama Dieng added, \u201cGiven the country's recent history, this kind of targeted violence is extremely dangerous and must be stopped.\u201d\n\nIt is good to hear UN officials making the hard-hitting statements, which are sure to convince both the Muslims and the Christians in CAR to put down their weapons, because other actions by the UN have been useless, and in a sense may have made things worse.\n\nAfter a coup in March 2013, Muslim S\u00e9l\u00e9ka militias began committing atrocities, particularly targeting the Christians. In December 2013, French Foreign Legion peacekeeping troops arrived to disarm the S\u00e9l\u00e9ka militias.\n\nThe actions of the French troops backfired. When the Muslim S\u00e9l\u00e9ka troops were disarmed, the Christian anti-Balaka militias \u201crushed into the vacuum,\u201d and began committing atrocities in 2014, for revenge against the S\u00e9l\u00e9kas. Since then, both Christians and Muslims have been committing atrocities, and it has become a full-scale generational crisis war. Thousands have been killed, and millions have been displaced.\n\nThe French peacekeepers were supposed to remain in CAR for just six months, until a United Nations force could take over. However, they remained in CAR for much longer than six months, and their withdrawal was only announced in October of last year, after several years of almost total failure. In addition, some of the French peacekeepers were charged with raping some of the CAR civilians that they were supposed to be protection. There is now a UN peacekeeping force of 12,500 troops known as MINUSCA, but as Wednesday\u2019s attack illustrates, it has not been any more successful.\n\nActually, I\u2019ve written about this many times in the last four years. CAR\u2019s last generational crisis war was the 1928-1931 Kongo-Wara Rebellion (\u201cWar of the Hoe Handle\u201d), which was a very long time ago, putting CAR today deep into a generational Crisis era, where a new crisis civil war has already started.\n\nFrom the point of view of Generational Dynamics, a generational crisis war cannot be stopped by \u201cpeacekeeping troops.\u201d It begins when the traumatized survivors of the previous crisis war are no longer around, and are no longer able to prevent the younger generations from starting another crisis war. Massacres and atrocities by both (or all) sides continue to grow and worsen on a tit-for-tat basis, usually for five years or more, until there\u2019s an \u201cexplosive climax,\u201d some genocidal massacre that\u2019s so horrific that it brings the war to an end, and causes the traumatized survivors, both winners and losers, to vow that they will never let such a war occur again.\n\nUN peacekeeping forces have been more or less successful in minimizing the violence in one city, the capital city Bangui, but everything outside of Bangui is completely lawless, and completely out of control of the peacekeepers. The rise of the 3R militias, and the new atrocities that it\u2019s perpetrating show how far the CAR civil war has yet to go.

Some 11,300 died.\n\nWith a mortality rate above 40 percent, the disease \u2014 one of a category of so-called haemorrhagic fevers \u2014 has an incubation period of up to three weeks. It causes violent and painful symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhoea, organ failure and internal bleeding.\n\nThe new vaccine was initially developed in Canada by public health authorities before being taken over by pharmaceutical giant Merck.\n\nIt is slated to be submitted by Merck to health authorities in the United States and Europe sometime next year under a fast-track approval process.\n\n\u201cWe may have a vaccine which is registered in 2018,\u201d Kieny told journalists at a press conference Thursday, noting that the standard approval process for a new drug takes a decade, if not more.\n\nIn the meantime, Merck has committed to ensuring that 300,000 doses of the vaccine are available for emergencies under a protocol called \u201ccompassionate use\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey will be able to produce a million in very short period of time,\u201d Kieny noted.\n\n\u2013 Unanswered questions \u2013\n\nThere are still questions to be resolved concerning the vaccine, including side effects.\n\nInitial tests last year did not include children, while the most recent trials covered those over six years old.\u00a0\n\nOf the more than 6,000 people injected with the Ebola vaccine only two showed serious adverse effects, the study reported. Both recovered fully.\n\nBut it is still unknown if the vaccine is safe for children six and under, pregnant women, or people with the AIDS virus \u2014 all groups that were excluded from the most recent trials.\n\nAnother unknown is how long innoculation lasts.\n\n\u201cWith the Canadian Merck vaccine, you have a protection very early after vaccination, but we don\u2019t know if it will last after six months,\u201d Kieny said.\n\nOther Ebola vaccines under development \u2014 some of which have been tested in humans \u2014 could prove more effective over a longer period.\n\nBritish firm Glaxosmithkline and Johnson & Johnson, based in the United States, each have experimental products in the pipeline.\n\nChina and Russia have also developed vaccines, with the Russian one having just finished the second phase of three-step clinical trials.\n\nSome of these vaccines require two doses three weeks apart, and may confer a longer immunity.\n\n\u201cThat might be better suited to immunise health workers in advance of an outbreak,\u201d Kieny said.\n\nHealth officials also point to the fact that other strains of the virus \u2014 including one in Sudan \u2014 will require the development of separate vaccines.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.08333325386047, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 630, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.5534552264200001, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161227140000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.38095238095238, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2017/01/16/trump-brexit-great-uk-us-deal-quickly/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [229, 318, 434, 444, 1463, 2756, 2783, 2942, 3166, 3386, 3474]}}, "headline": "\u2018CATASTROPHIC MISTAKE\u2019: Trump Slams Merkel\u2019s Migrant Policy", "wordcount_as_scraped": 614, "date": "20170116120000", "story_content": "President-elect Donald Trump has slammed the mass migration policy of Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel and welcomed Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union (EU), predicting\u00a0it will \u201cend up being a great thing\u201d and other countries will depart the crisis-stricken\u00a0bloc.\n\n\u201cI sort of, as you know, predicted it,\u201d he told British parliamentarian Michael Gove, reporting for London\u2019s\u00a0The Times\u00a0in President-elect Trump\u2019s first British press interview.\n\n\u201cThe heat I took was unbelievable,\u201d he said, \u201c[but] people don\u2019t want to have other people coming in and destroying their country.\n\n\u201c[I]n this country we're gonna go very strong borders from the day I get in\u2026 We don't want people coming in from Syria who we don't know who they are.

Basically a vehicle for Germany. That's why I thought the UK was so smart in getting out,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump also praised the continuing strength of the British economy, a blow to the Bank of England, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other forecasters who had to tear up their negative predictions shortly after referendum day.\n\n\u201cI'll tell you, the fact that your pound sterling has gone down? Great,\u201d he said, echoing the sentiments of Lord King and former IMF Deputy Director Ashoka Mody. \u201cBecause business is unbelievable in a lot of parts in the UK, as you know.\u201d\n\nKey figures in Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s team were less than charitable towards the incoming president while he was running for office, leading to concerns that Britain may find it difficult to establish a good working relationship with his administration after Brexit.\n\nIt is fortunate that Trump, whose mother hailed from Scotland\u2019s windswept Western Isles, has an instinctive affinity for the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201c[M]y mother sort of had a flair, she loved the Queen,\u201d he revealed. \u201cShe was so proud of the Queen.\u201d\n\nTrump offered particularly positive signals on trade.

He is the president of the National Council for Free Elections in Iran.\n\n\u201cWe realize that the current regime is not going to voluntarily leave the scene, which is why we have put together a campaign of resistance and civil disobedience,\u201d Pahlavi told Breitbart News. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been in contact with a variety of secularists within Iran representing all sorts of views from workers to teachers to labor unions\u201d to other organizations.\n\nOver half of Iran\u2019s population is under the age of 40. The crown prince noted that the advent of social media and technology is a priceless tool in\u00a0the quest for freedom. \u201cAnd fortunately in this world of social media and Internet communication most of the give and take happens by means that were not available 20 years ago,\u201d he said.\n\nPahlavi recently\u00a0penned a letter to President Donald Trump congratulating him on his victory. Asked how he views Trump and his administration with regard to U.S.-Iran relations, he said, \u201cI think the current president has indicated that he wants to be much more in support of strengthening the people\u2019s hand and, at the same time, weakening the regime. And I think that\u2019s exactly what we were hoping to hear.\u201d\n\nHe said this rhetoric and support \u201cshould not be limited to the U.S,\u201d adding that he\u2019s \u201calways advocated that the empowerment of any people is always the best solution at the end, especially when they have to fight very oppressive regimes. So, engaging with the people, helping civil society in these countries, is the quickest path to maximizing the success of such nations to overcome whatever struggle they are facing.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s former \u00a0recently died. The businessman\u00a0had a checkered political past and was considered the father of Iran\u2019s nuclear program. While some within the regime described his as a \u201cman of peace,\u201d he was better remembered by many of the Iranian people as an oppressor and for having orchestrated several international terrorist atrocities.\n\nThe crown prince also commented on the recent death of Iran\u2019s former president, Hashami Rafsanjani, who was described in the media as a \u201cman of peace\u201d but who was the father of Iran\u2019s nuclear program, as well as an oppressive ruler. Pahlavi compared Rafsanjani\u2019s death to the passing of Cuba\u2019s late dictator Fidel Castro: \u201cIt\u2019s not the same anymore, no matter how many more junior cadres remain. And in that sense, more of a void will be created.\u201d He noted the importance of making sure that \u201cthe void is filled with the proper alternative. That\u2019s something everyone should be concerned with.\u201d\n\nEarlier Monday evening, Pahlavi addressed a private audience\u00a0and\u00a0urged \u201ccivil disobedience by means of non-violence.\u201d\n\nAlthough he did not mention President Barack Obama by name, the crown prince said, \u201cWhen you fight extremely brutal regimes, such movements cannot succeed without having tacit support from other freedom-loving countries and governments.\u201d His words evoked memories of the failure of the Obama administration to provide much-needed support to the ailing Iranian people during the 2009 Green Revolution and the stolen election that fueled it.\n\nWith Rafsanjani\u2019s death, however, the crown prince noted that \u201cthe regime is pretty much beginning to show indications of fragmentation, going eventually towards their collapse.\u201d He noted \u201cthe importance of making sure that the path to the alternative is as smooth as possible and that complete measures are taken to make sure that a dictatorship will\u00a0not be replaced by another one. And that, indeed, it is the people who will triumph and nobody else.\u201d\n\nAsked if the crown prince would consider taking on an elected or lineal leadership role in his country of birth, and the land where his father reigned as its last king, Pahlavi said:\n\nI\u2019ve always said this is not about me. It\u2019s about the Iranian people and their opportunity to finally get self-determination and freedom. That\u2019s my only objective at this point. And the day that we have free elections will be the day I will consider my political mission in life accomplished. From that day on, I cannot tell you now what the circumstances will be. I\u2019ve always said that I\u2019m ready to serve my country, in whatever capacity that my constituents choose.\n\nFollow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope\u00a0@AdelleNaz", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.2315270900726298, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 735, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.6109131951499998, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 18, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170125200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.44897959183673, "mft_mean": 1.63636363636}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/12/08/exclusive-house-conservatives-rally-behind-rep-mick-mulvaney-for-trumps-omb-chief/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [443, 464, 727, 757, 852, 1217, 2083, 2209, 2608, 3353]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 555, "scraper_regex": 586}}, "headline": "Exclusive: House Conservatives Rally Behind Rep.

Taming regulation and the federal bureaucracy are stated priorities of the\u00a0president-elect.\n\nThrough a spokesman, Mulvaney declined to speak to Breitbart News, citing his desire to keep his dealings with the presidential transition team confidential.\n\nMulvaney may be reluctant to speak, but his colleagues eagerly shared their enthusiasm for his intelligence, work ethic, and commitment to the conservative agenda.\n\nAnother member of the House Freedom Caucus, Rep. Timothy A. Huelskamp (R.-Kansas), who said he spoke to the Trump team about being the head of the Agriculture Department, told Breitbart News Mulvaney understands the realities of the federal budget. \u201cThe old saying is that a vision without funding is an illusion\u2013Mick understands that.\u201d\n\nThe Kansas congressman, who lost his August primary to a challenger backed by leadership, said Mulvaney would bring another dimension to the job. \u201cThey say I\u2019m an &ssh@le, well, he\u2019s an\u00a0&ssh@le, which is what you need in that job.\u201d\n\nChairman of the House Rules Committee Rep.

In the video, she stated, \u201cour nation is divided. We have been assaulted.\u201d\n\n\nIt\u2019s an act of terrorism. One of the most frightening things for me, and most people in my life, is that the people committing the assault are among us.

And that makes it more painful.\n\n\nShe said, \u201cWe are way beyond Republicans and Democrats and we are really back to being in civil war. And I don\u2019t mean it in a fighting way. But our nation is divided, clearly as it was in Civil War times.\u201d Cox then added, \u201cWe are the majority. More of us voted to not have that kind of leadership.

In his letter,\u00a0Steel made three demands:\u00a0that Cox take \u201ctake an anger management course that\u2019s monitored, because sometime they lie on this stuff,\u00a0that she formally apologize to all the students in this class, and to have\u00a0college faculty send a letter that all faculty be respectful to students.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Breitbart News, Steel said, \u201cThis has gone on [at] thousands of American campuses and tens of thousands of classrooms\u00a0\u2026\u00a0We finally had a smoking gun with the recording of this teacher.\u00a0She\u2019s been doing this for 30 years and has never been spotlighted like this before.\u201d\n\nHe said that by\u00a0\u201cusing her power as a teacher, and controlling the grades, she stifles dissent,\u201d and is using her mantle of power \u201cto basically scare and shame students.\u201d Steel added, \u201cShe\u2019s insulting about half the class. Either she is seeking to insult them directly, or she is so out of touch that she can\u2019t believe reality and lives in a\u00a0typical liberal cocoon.\u201d\n\nSteel suggested that \u201cevery student who loves freedom should arm themselves with a fully-charged smart phone and video tape crazy professors. It\u2019s a free speech right. The administrators are threatening the student\u201d who recorded the video.\n\nAccording to the Orange County Register, the union that represents Cox defended her and said any students involved in the recording violated school and state codes and could be punished. Orange Coast College is a public community college.\n\nSteel noted that, legally, the school could prohibit an outsider from recording, and\u00a0that\u00a0if a student does that without permission they could be subjected to administrative sanction. However, if the school attempted to do that to the student, Steel said he would sue.\n\nThe Register notes that\u00a0Rob Schneiderman, president of the Coast Federation of Educators, AFT 1911, which represents the school\u2019s faculty, has a different perspective on the incident.\n\n\u201cThis faculty member is known for her open and engaging ways in class, open to all sides of the issues,\u201d Schneiderman told the Register. \u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0unfortunate that this student chose to not engage in an open dialogue, which she encourages.\u201d\n\nOther recent incidents against Republicans on Orange Coast College\u2019s campus include the Vice President of the Feminist club \u2014 who happens to be a man \u2014 ripping apart a sign supporting President-elect Donald Trump at the OCC Republicans\u2019 booth:\n\n\n\nFollow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope\u00a0@AdelleNaz", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.9831387996673597, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 684, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.3673198504500004, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161210040000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.94736842105263, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/news/vice-president-pledges-to-end-taxpayer-funded-abortion/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Vice president pledges to end taxpayer-funded abortion", "wordcount_as_scraped": 609, "date": "20170127190000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence told a crowd gathered Friday in Washington for the annual March for Life rally that ending taxpayer-funded abortion and choosing a Supreme Court justice who will uphold \u201cGod-given\u201d liberties are among top priorities of the Trump administration.\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s first official acts after taking office a week ago was to sign an executive order banning U.S. aid to foreign groups that provide abortions. Pence said more such action would continue.\n\nPresident Donald Trump will \u201cwork with the Congress to end taxpayer funding of abortion and abortion providers, and we will devote those resources to health care services for women across America,\u201d said Pence to the crowd gathered near the Washington Monument.\n\nThe vice president also accused the U.S. Supreme Court, in its landmark Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion, of having \u201cturned away from these timeless ideals.\u201d\n\nPence said Trump would be nominating a Supreme Court justice next week who \u201cwill uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe March for Life is usually held on the anniversary of the 1973 Supreme Court decision \u2014 Jan. 22 \u2014 but it was pushed back this year because of Trump\u2019s inauguration. Pence is the first sitting vice president to address the march. Kellyanne Conway, one of President Donald Trump\u2019s top advisers, also spoke.\n\nIn Congress, Republican majorities in both chambers are vowing to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood, which provided more than a third of the nation\u2019s abortions in 2014. They also hope to ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Trump has pledged to sign both measures if they reach his desk.\n\nLess than a year ago, with Barack Obama\u2019s second term winding down, things were markedly different. The Supreme Court struck down Texas\u2019 strict regulations on abortion clinics as interfering with a woman\u2019s constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy. And with polls at the time suggesting Hillary Clinton would likely defeat Trump, abortion opponents worried about an era of liberal majorities on the court.\n\n\u201cThe horizon looked bleak for the pro-life movement,\u201d said Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life.\n\nMancini suggested that many voters chose Trump largely because he pledged to appoint a Supreme Court justice who shared their views on abortion, even if they disagreed with him on other issues.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t identify as a Republican or a Democrat but I do vote pro-life,\u201d Mancini said.\n\nAbortion opponents also were heartened by a recent study that found the number of abortions in the United States dropped under 1 million in 2014, the lowest total in 40 years. The report by the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights, credited increased access to birth control but also a surge in abortion restrictions in many states.\n\nAmericans remain deeply divided on abortion.\n\nThe latest Gallup survey, released last spring, found that 47 percent of Americans described themselves as pro-choice and 46 percent as pro-life. It also found that 79 percent believed abortion should be legal in either some or all circumstances.\n\nIlyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said that poll shows why abortion-rights supporters shouldn\u2019t despair. She also said Republicans were taking actions that would result in more illegal abortions and deaths of pregnant women.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of Americans support Roe v. Wade and support the legal right to abortion,\u201d Hogue said.\n\nFriday\u2019s march comes less than a week after one of the largest mass demonstrations in the city\u2019s history, the Women\u2019s March on Washington, which drew more than half a million people opposed to Trump on issues including abortion.\n\n___\n\nFollow Ben Nuckols on Twitter at https://twitter.com/APBenNuckols .", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.83911681175232, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 580, "FairnessVirtue": 4, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.19315237851, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170127190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.62068965517241, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2017/01/22/queens-chaplain-steps-speaking-islamic-prayer-cathedral/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [137, 734, 739, 810, 926, 1139, 1284, 1776, 1899, 2218, 2696, 3078, 3160, 3599, 3840, 3843]}}, "headline": "Queen\u2019s Chaplain Who Questioned Quran Prayers in Cathedral Steps Down After Attempts to \u2018Silence, Defenestrate\u2019 Him", "wordcount_as_scraped": 645, "date": "20170123140000", "story_content": "Less than a week after\u00a0one of the Queen\u2019s Chaplains spoke out against an Islamic Prayer denying the divinity of Jesus Christ being read out in a Scottish Cathedral, the senior churchman has tendered his resignation from that office.\n\nFormer Chaplain to Her Majesty the Reverend Gavin Ashenden announced his resignation on his personal blog on Saturday night, anticipating that a BBC Radio 4 segment on him and the controversy surrounding the Quranic readings in a Scottish Cathedral to be broadcast on Sunday morning would reveal his resignation despite his requests to the contrary. Remarking that the decision to step\u00a0down\u00a0was \u201cthe most honourable course of action\u201d and had come after years of\u00a0\u201cattempts to silence or defenestrate me\u201d, Rev. Ashenden said he had spoken out in the past on controversial matters\u00a0as a \u201cmatter of integrity and responsibility\u201d.\n\nEarlier this week Rev. Ashenden called the decision to allow sung prayers from the Quran in a Scottish Cathedral service that demands Allah is worshipped and denies\u00a0the divinity of Jesus Christ, \u201cblasphemy\u201d, and said the Cathedral should apologise to persecuted Christians worldwide.\n\nIn a letter published in\u00a0The Times, the Rev. said: \u201cQuite apart from the wide distress (some would say blasphemy) caused by denigrating Jesus in Christian worship, apologies may be due to the Christians suffering dreadful persecution at the hands of Muslims in the Middle East and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cTo have the core of a faith for which they have suffered deeply treated so casually by senior Western clergy such as the Provost of Glasgow is unlikely to have a positive outcome\u201d. In an article for the Jersey Evening Post\u00a0titled \u2018The Choice is Between Jesus and Mohammed\u2019 penned shortly afterwards, the priest called the decision to choose that\u00a0particular Quran reading to be read on the Feast of the Epiphany a \u201cglowing cherry of offence to the iced cake of incompetence\u201d.\n\nNow his opposition to the Muslim prayer in a British Cathedral has brought the churchman\u2019s tenure as a chaplain to the Queen to a premature end.\n\nRev. Ashenden said he\u2019d had a conversation\u00a0\u201cinstigated by officials at Buckingham Palace\u201d, and it had been made clear that he could not continue to speak out on faith issues of the day, as his position as one of 32 Queen\u2019s chaplains could compromise the political neutrality of the Monarch.\n\nWhile he had defended himself from such charges in the past by asking \u201cin what way is a priest defending the faith on behalf of a monarch who was Defender of the Faith, incongruous or improper?\u201d, the clear choice between silence\u00a0while enjoying a \u201cpublic honour\u201d and speaking the truth had to be made. He told BBC Radio 4:\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s clear to me that accepting the role as a chaplain to the Queen does not give one a platform where one can speak controversially in the public space. So, in those circumstances one has to choose between whether one wants to accept an important honour or whether ones chooses\u00a0to continue a debate in the public space.\n\n\u201cI am fairly clear in my own mind that\u00a0my duty to my conscience, to my orders, to my understanding of Christianity and my vocation, is that I\u2019m supposed to be speaking out in the public space on behalf of the Christ I serve\u201d.\n\nThe Reverend Ashenden has been a target of controversy for his outspoken views on faith in the modern world for some years. The Independent reported in 2015 on his remarks on Islam, which he said \u201cinvites people to violence\u201d, and that passages in the\u00a0Quran \u201ctell you to kill your enemies\u201d.\n\nWhen warned his comments could be found offensive by practicing Muslims, the Rev. replied: \u201cIf they are offended by my quoting the Koran they are not offended by me, they are offended by the Koran\u201d.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.96610164642334, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 648, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.00412797137, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 3, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170123140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.8580246913580205, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/news/israel-pushes-ahead-with-settlements-as-trump-takes-office/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Israel pushes ahead with settlements as Trump takes office", "wordcount_as_scraped": 782, "date": "20170122200000", "story_content": "JERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 The municipality of Jerusalem granted final approval Sunday for the construction of hundreds of new homes in east Jerusalem, while a hard-line Cabinet minister pushed the government to annex a major West Bank settlement as emboldened Israeli nationalists welcomed the presidency of Donald Trump.\n\nAfter eight years of testy ties with President Barack Obama, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he is looking forward to a new era of close relations with the U.S. under Trump. The two were scheduled to talk on the phone later Sunday.\n\nAt his weekly Cabinet meeting, Netanyahu thanked Trump for his friendship and his inauguration speech pledge to battle radical Islamic militants. He said they would discuss the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the situation in Syria and the Iranian threat, among other issues.\n\nMore hawkish elements in his coalition, however, are already calling for concrete action given Trump\u2019s perceived acquiescence to Israeli settlement building.\n\nEducation Minister Naftali Bennett, leader of the pro-settler Jewish Home Party, was pressing the government to back legislation that would annex Maaleh Adumim, a sprawling West Bank settlement just east of Jerusalem. He also urged Netanyahu to abandon his stated position in favor of a Palestinian state alongside Israel.\n\nNetanyahu, a longtime supporter of the settlements, has nonetheless been cautious about expanding them in the face of strong opposition from the U.S. and other Western allies. With Trump signaling a much softer line toward the settlements, Israeli hard-liners say there is no longer any reason to show restraint.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in 50 years, the prime minister can decide: either sovereignty or Palestine,\u201d Bennett wrote on Twitter.\n\nAn official in the Jewish Home Party said Netanyahu was urging Bennett to put his proposal on hold. Netanyahu said that he had been asked by Trump administration officials not to take any major action without proper coordination, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss internal coalition negotiations.\n\nThe official said Jewish Home officials were skeptical of Netanyahu\u2019s claims and would continue to push the government to approve the annexation measure. Netanyahu\u2019s office declined to comment.\n\nSuch a move would cause a major clash with the Palestinians and the rest of the international community, which consider settlements to be illegal. The Palestinians seek all of the West Bank and east Jerusalem \u2014 areas captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war \u2014 for a future independent state.\n\nAnnexing Maaleh Adumim would be seen as undermining negotiations. It is also in a strategic location in the middle of the West Bank that could impede the establishment of a future Palestinian state.\n\nIn the meantime, the Jerusalem municipal housing committee granted building permits for 566 new homes in east Jerusalem. The permits had been put on hold for the final months of the Obama administration.\n\nBuilding is planned in the neighborhoods of Ramot, Pisgat Zeev and Ramat Shlomo.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been through eight tough years with Obama pressuring to freeze construction,\u201d said Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat. \u201cI hope that era is over and we now we can build and develop Jerusalem for the welfare of its residents, Jews and Arabs alike.\u201d\n\nDeputy Mayor Meir Turjeman, who heads the committee, said an additional 11,000 homes were planned in east Jerusalem. He said he hopes to get the plans approved by the end of the year and begin construction in the next two to three years.\n\nIsrael clashed frequently with Obama over construction in areas it conquered in the 1967 Mideast war, and last month, the Obama White House allowed the U.N. Security Council to pass a resolution condemning settlements as illegal.\n\nTrump has signaled he will take a far kinder approach to them.\n\nTrump\u2019s appointed ambassador to Israel has close ties to Jewish West Bank settlements as does the foundation run by the family of Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Tax records show Trump also donated money to a Jewish seminary in a settlement.\n\nIn a sign of the changing times, a delegation of West Bank settler leaders said it was invited by Trump administration officials to attend the inauguration.\n\nUnlike other West Bank settlements, Israel annexed east Jerusalem and considers its neighborhoods inseparable parts of its capital. But the annexation is not internationally recognized.\n\nNetanyahu says Jews have been in these areas for centuries and that their presence does not undermine prospects for peace. He blames failed peace efforts on Arab denials of Jews\u2019 historical connections to the land.\n\nNabil Abu Rdeneh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, condemned the building plans and called on the U.N. to act. \u201cIt is time to stop dealing with Israel as a state above the law,\u201d he said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.21948218345642, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 770, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.43739893644, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 17, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170122200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.20779220779221, "mft_mean": 1.54545454545}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/11/26/tancredo-left-targets-giuliani-fighting-terrorism-energetically/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3072]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 526, "scraper_regex": 558}}, "headline": "Tancredo: Left Targets Giuliani for Fighting Terrorism too Energetically", "wordcount_as_scraped": 558, "date": "20161126190000", "story_content": "In a move that invites parody if not outright ridicule, the left-oriented Politico blog this week went after former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani for fighting Iran-sponsored terrorism too aggressively. Well, duh!\n\nIn a week that saw \u201cFake News\u201d become the number one topic of debate among mainstream journalists, Politico decided to double down on stupidity and serve up a prime example of fake news. The Washington post dutifully echoed the false accusations to give the lie a cloak of respectability not bestowed by Politico.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s alleged violation was participating in events sponsored by an anti-Iran exile group, the People\u2019s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI-MEK), a group that has widespread bipartisan support in Congress and that even John Kerry\u2019s State Department admits has provided valuable intelligence on Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program.\n\nThe PMOI/MEK is the largest and most influential member of the coalition of anti-Mullah groups, the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), which acts as a government in exile while aiding pro-democracy forces inside Iran.\n\nMany members of Congress in both political parties have supported the work of the PMOI/MEK, including Democrat Sen. Robert Menendez, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, Rep. Ed Royce, and Sen. John McCain. Other prominent supporters include Newt Gingrich, John Bolton, former CIA Director James Woolsey, and Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz. I, too, while a member of Congress and also more recently, have participated in PMOI/MEK-sponsored conferences and can personally bear witness to the group\u2019s anti-terrorism credentials.\n\nThe fallacious, unproven charges repeated by Politico\u2018s headline that the PMOI \u201ckilled Americans\u201d is based largely on an incident inside Iran back in the 1970\u2019s, before the Mullahs came to power and 25 years before the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States.\n\nThere has never been a shred of evidence that any members of the current PMOI were involved in those events, yet the American left is now using those discredited allegations to smear one of our nation\u2019s fiercest anti-terrorism warriors, Rudy Giuliani.\n\nThe charges against PMOI-MEK dredged up by Politico have been refuted by multiple investigations and are no longer given credence even by Obama\u2019s State Department. For nearly two decades, those allegations arising from events in the 1970\u2019s were used as a basis for listing the PMOI/MEK as a terrorist organization.\n\nSo, why is the political left suddenly so interested in smearing Rudy Giuliani?\n\nCould it have anything to do with Giuliani being one of two or three individuals on Donald Trump\u2019s short list for Secretary of State? Do Democrats fear that the former NYC mayor might take the U.S. State Department in a new direction in opposing Iran\u2019s vast network of financing for terrorist groups worldwide?\n\nIf the American news media establishment had an ounce of integrity, this Politico smear campaign against Giuliani would be laughed out of town. Instead, in\u00a0 an act of sheer desperation, prominent parts of the establishment media have joined the lynch mob. Obviously, this tells us more about the left\u2019s motives and goals than it does about Giuliani.\n\nThe establishment media have run interference for Obama\u2019s Iran policy for eight years, and apparently prefer Mitt Romney over Rudy Giuliani as President Trump\u2019s Secretary of State.

While most Americans recognized terrorism as involving the use of violence and intimidation to pursue one's political goals, Napolitano sought to impart a \"kinder, gentler\" perspective on it.\n\nWhen asked, after addressing Congress for the first time in 2009, why she never mentioned the word terrorism, Napolitano responded it was preferable to call such acts\u00a0\"man-caused\" disasters. She suggested doing so \"is perhaps only a nuance, but it demonstrates that we want to move away from the politics of fear toward a policy of being prepared for all risks that can occur.\"\n\nOf course, in the aftermath of years of terrorist attacks against American targets \u2013 such as the 1983\u00a0bombing\u00a0of the Marine Barracks in Beirut, the 1993 World Trade Center\u00a0bombing, the 1996 Khobar Towers\u00a0bombing\u00a0in Saudi Arabia, the 1998 U.S. embassy\u00a0bombings\u00a0in East Africa, the 2000\u00a0attack\u00a0on the USS Cole in Yemen and the 9/11\u00a0attacks,\u00a0all performed by Islamic extremists \u2013 we thought we already had a pretty good handle as to what terrorism was and who, primarily, was responsible for it. Apparently, we did not.\n\nNapolitano\u2019s logic in such reasoning was lost on many and, fortunately, the words \"man-caused disaster\" never caught on. Contributing perhaps to this failure was\u00a0listings\u00a0of top disasters caused by man failing to recognize intentional violence. The common factor in all was that they were accidents. None involving malicious intent.\n\nOne wonders if Napolitano regretted using such a nondescript definition when, in April 2010, the infamous Gulf of Mexico oil\u00a0spill\u00a0(also a man-made disaster) began making headlines.\n\nBut Napolitano's attempt to minimize the dark side of terrorism (as if a lighter side exists) marked the beginning of an eight-year effort of Obama double-speak to hide Islamic terrorism's sinister intentions and to mold the public's perception of it.\n\nSuch double-speak quickly came into play later that year when self-admitted Islamist Major Hasan\u00a0Nidal\u00a0went on a shooting rampage, killing thirteen and wounding more than 30 unarmed victims at Fort Hood in Texas.\n\nTwo words unmentioned following the attack were \"terrorism\" and \"Islam.\" To avoid suggesting the former's linkage, Obama dubbed it an act of \"workplace violence.\" The dead and wounded were unable to qualify for various benefits that combat victims normally did, until\u00a0action\u00a0by Congress worked around Obama's double-speak.\n\nPresident Obama continued to use similar language for obvious Islamist terror acts during his term.\n\nAfter a Muslim declaring his loyalty to ISIS shot and killed dozens at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, earlier this year, Obama finally used the word \"terror,\" but only in the context \"we\" were the ones responsible for it. How so? We refused to change our attitudes about the gay community or to demonstrate a willingness to address gun control.\n\nThus, a primary motivator for the Muslim killer's rampage, Islam's mandate to kill gays, was hidden behind Obama's double-speak about homophobia and gun control.\n\nEven when a mother who had lost a son in the fight against Islamism pressed Obama as to why he refuses to link terrorism and Islam, the president suggested the question was a \"sort of manufactured\" issue. He then explained that, while groups like al Qaeda and ISIL have \"perverted and distorted\" Islam using it as a vehicle for \"barbarism and death,\" he refused to lump such murderers into the billions of peaceful Muslims around the world.\n\nObama appears to\u00a0firmly believe that if you lie long enough to Americans, they will start to believe what you tell them.\u00a0Unfortunately, it has worked, as evidenced by university campuses today turning the terrorist spotlight not upon Islam but upon America.\n\nA humanities course taught at the University of Colorado does not equate terrorism to the acts of Islamic extremists but, rather, to our Founding Fathers! That is because, they argue, the Revolutionary War was not about freedom but establishing an economic system founded upon slavery and racism. And, after almost two and a half centuries of freedom, apparently America fares no better as an Orange Coast psychology professor teaches. The election results were \"an act of terrorism,\" she claims, as the electoral college process allows a population's minority to assault the majority.\n\nObama's legacy has promoted our Founding Fathers as terrorists and Islamic terrorists as not.

Of the system itself, CHP deputy chairperson\u00a0\u00d6zg\u00fcr \u00d6zel said the measure would bring about \u201cthe end of this country\u201d and accused AKP lawmakers of \u201ctrying to destroy yourself.\u201d\n\nThe CHP ultimately declined to vote on the later provisions debated in the bill in protest.\n\n\n\nThe secularist newspaper\u00a0Cumhuriyet published a gallery of photos of the aftermath, including the\u00a0broken podium:\n\nAmong those injured was CHP representative Kaplan, who attempted to film the brawl and had an AKP lawmaker wrestle her mobile phone out of her hands.\n\nImages later surfaced of her bruised neck, where other lawmakers had apparently grabbed her to keep her from filming.\n\n\n14 y\u0131ll\u0131k iktidar\u0131n\u0131z \u015fiddet, taciz heryerde.

Parliament\u2019s AKP majority voted to strip these members of their legislative immunity for their opposition to Erdogan last year, and dozens were arrested following that legal move. According to Kurdish outlet Rudaw, the HDP estimates nearly 9,000 of its politicians and supporters have been detained since July 2015.\n\nProsecutors are seeking a life sentence for\u00a0Figen Y\u00fcksekda\u011f, one of two HDP co-chairs, for a variety of crimes including \u201cdisrupting the unity of the state.\u201d\n\nErdogan himself applauded the legislative session late Wednesday\u00a0\"despite opposition efforts to delay the process\u201d of converting to a presidential system.\n\n\"Blocking or prolonging the work of parliament does nothing. You can do whatever you want, but this charter will be passed from parliament and will be presented to the public,\" he asserted,\u00a0\"If you have respect for the people, believing in the people's will and believing in Gazi Mustafa Kemal [Atat\u00fcrk]'s principle that sovereignty rests unconditionally with the nation, then let the discussions be finalized and let it be presented to the people.\u201d\n\nThis latest brawl follows a string of similar incidents between AKP politicians and minority parties. In December 2016, AKP members physically attacked their fellow lawmakers over the arrests of dozens of HDP members. In May, lawmakers came to blows over the passing of the legislative immunity law that allowed those arrests to happen. In April, a parliament brawl erupted over a bill on clinching a migrant deal with the European Union. In February, an AKP member used a gavel to break the ribs of a minority party member over a \u201ccontroversial homeland security bill.\u201d\n\nWhile 2016 was a banner year for parliament scuffles, such incidents occurred with some regularity before then. A year before the gavel incident, a CHP representative attacked a colleague for addressing him incorrectly. A year before, legislators threw water bottles and an iPad tablet at each other over a debate regarding the appointment of judges.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.28061819076538, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 716, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.15130173931, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170113030000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.93296089385475, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/12/02/sen-bernie-sanders-no-show-skips-iran-sanctions-99-0-senate-vote/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [164, 1113, 1651]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 576, "scraper_regex": 606}}, "headline": "Senate Passes Iran Sanctions 99-0, Sen.

The bill passed the House 419-to-1 with the only nay-vote coming from Rep. Thomas Massie, also a Republican from Kentucky, who objects to economic sanctions on libertarian grounds.\n\n\u201cThis is even more important given how the current administration has been hostage by Iran\u2019s threats \u2013 by Tehran\u2019s threat to withdraw from the nuclear agreement and how it ignored Iran\u2019s overall efforts to upset the balance of power in the greater Middle East,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nThe senator, whose wife Elaine Chao will lead the Transportation Department under\u00a0President-elect Donald J. Trump, said the incoming president will be more attentive to dangers Iran poses to America\u2019s national security.\n\n\u201cThe authorities extended by this legislation gives us some of the tools needed to, if necessary, impose sanctions to hold the regime to account and to keep the American people safer,\u201d he said. \u201cNext year, I expect the new administration and the new Congress will undertake a total review of our overall Iran policy.\u201d\n\nA member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. David Perdue (R.-Ga.),\u00a0said he was very happy about the extension of the sanctions because it signals to Iran that Congress is not going along with the President\u2019s loose hand and blind eye to Iran\u2019s violations of the nuclear deal.\n\nPerdue has introduced several pieces of legislation to hold Iran accountable, including a bill to prohibit cash payments to state sponsors of terror, and another to improve oversight of the implementation of President Obama's nuclear deal with Iran.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama never should have waived key sanctions on Iran,\u201d Perdue said. \u201cBefore the ink was dry on his dangerous nuclear deal, the rogue nation test-fired ballistic missiles and accumulated excess heavy water, which could be used for making plutonium bombs.\u201d\n\nThe Georgian said, \u201cSince then, Iran has continued to threaten our strategic allies in the Middle East and weaponized terrorist groups across the volatile region. Today, we took action to reauthorize key sanctions, giving President-elect Trump a full menu of options to implement against Iran for any future transgressions.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State John F. Kerry visited Capitol Hill Tuesday to personally lobby Democratic senators against joining Republicans in antagonizing the Iranians, which is a risk because the Obama administration in its nuclear deal with Iran front loaded the thawing of seizing assets, so that Iran no longer has the same financial incentive to adhere to the agreement.\n\nA measure of the chamber\u2019s unified front against Kerry, Obama and their Iranian policy was the remarks given by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D.-Conn.), one of the Senate\u2019s most partisan Democrats, in support of supporting the sanctions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical step toward deterring and impeding support of Iran\u2019s development of conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to encourage my colleagues to support this 10-year reauthorization,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must act before it expires before the end of the year.

Yet even its proponents concede that it only prepares students for community-college level work. In truth, Common Core is a dramatic reduction of the nature and purpose of education to mere workforce preparation.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported in 2013, Bradley led some 130 Catholic scholars in a letter to the United States Catholic bishops, requesting that they abandon implementation of the Common Core in Catholic dioceses. At that point, about 100 of the 195 Catholic dioceses in the nation had adopted the standards reform.\n\nThe letter asserted that Common Core does \"a grave disservice to Catholic education\" and is \"contrary to tradition and academic studies on reading and human formation.\"\n\nReferring to the Common Core's emphasis on informational reading, the scholars charged that supporters of the Core were seeking to \"transform 'literacy'\" into a 'critical' skill set, at the expense of sustained and heartfelt encounters with great works of literature.\"\n\nCalling Common Core \"so deeply flawed,\" the scholars continued:\n\nPromoters of Common Core say that it is designed to make America's children\u00a0\"college and career ready.\" We instead judge Common Core to be a recipe for\u00a0standardized workforce preparation. Common Core shortchanges the central goals of all\u00a0sound education and surely those of Catholic education: to grow in the virtues necessary\u00a0to know, love, and serve the Lord, to mature into a responsible, flourishing adult, and to\u00a0contribute as a citizen to the process of responsible democratic self-government.\nCommon Core adopts a bottom-line, pragmatic approach to education. The heart\u00a0of its philosophy is, as far as we can see, that it is a waste of resources to \"over-educate\"\u00a0people. The basic goal of K-12 schools is to provide everyone with a modest skill set;\u00a0after that, people can specialize in college \u2013 if they end up there. Truck-drivers do not\u00a0need to know Huck Finn. Physicians have no use for the humanities. Only those\u00a0destined to major in literature need to worry about Ulysses.\n\n\"The contrast between a sound Catholic education and Common Core could scarcely be sharper,\" writes Bradley today, citing the joint publication of the Pioneer Institute and the American Principles Project titled, After the Fall: Catholic Education Beyond the Common Core.\n\nBradley further explains\u00a0that attempts by Catholic educators to \"work with\" or adapt the Common Core standards are\u00a0useless.\n\n\"Common Core is so philosophically at odds with a sound Catholic education that an acceptable modus vivendi is unavailable,\" he states. \"Trying to pour Common Core into such venerable wineskins will burst them.\"\n\nBradley observes the move to adopt Common Core in many secularized or independent \"Catholic\" schools is consistent with the fact that the \"Catholicism\" in the schools is already of the watered-down variety.\n\nHe writes:\n\nThese schools are already far down the path of transition from providing a truly Catholic education (as it is so aptly described in \"After the Fall\") to being more like a religiously inspired, affordable private alternative to dysfunctional public schools. The appeal of this denouement is undeniable: urban \"Catholic\" schools might be the best route up and out of the ghetto for thousands of non-Catholic children who deserve that opportunity. But this encouraging effect is and must be just that: a welcome side-benefit of providing a genuine Catholic education.\n\nJust as more parents are withdrawing their children from Common Core public schools and choosing to homeschool them instead, Bradley warns the same will happen to Catholic schools that have signed onto the Core, a situation that risks more Catholic young people with little to no knowledge of their faith.\n\n\"Adopting Common Core will surely accelerate this exodus, a hemorrhage of precisely those students who should form a Catholic school's backbone,\" he adds.\n\nTrump\u2019s education secretary nominee billionaire Betsy DeVos has for years financed and served as a board member of organizations that promote Common Core, but she has recently denied that she is a supporter of the standards.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.24479803442954998, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0,

Russia and Brexit loom over a \u201cminefield\u201d summit of European Union leaders in Brussels on Thursday at the end of a tumultuous year for the crisis-hit bloc.\n\nThe EU leaders will hold dinner without British Prime Minister Theresa May where they will try to present a united front over how they handle Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc.\n\nThey are also expected to rollover sanctions against Moscow over the conflict in Ukraine for another six months, but are unlikely to impose any new measures in response to the carnage in Aleppo.\n\nThey will further hold crisis talks about a pact with Ukraine that the Netherlands has threatened to torpedo if the EU refuses to offer guarantees against further integration for Kiev.\n\n\u201cWe are treading on a minefield, there are so many issues on the agenda that still can go wrong,\u201d warned a senior EU European Union official.\n\nThe one-day summit, cut back from the usual two days, wraps up an annus horribilis for the bloc that has seen it face a wave of populism including the shock Brexit referendum vote.\n\n\u2013 Dutch Ukraine worries \u2013\n\nThe thorniest issue on Thursday could be Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte\u2019s efforts to negotiate a way past a referendum in April in which his country voted against a key EU-Ukraine pact.\n\nThe Netherlands is the only one of the 28 EU states that has not ratified the deal so far, and Rutte wants vows that the pact is not a first step towards EU membership for Ukraine, and that it will not provide defence guarantees to Kiev.\n\n\u201cFailure of the ratification would be a huge defeat for the EU, Ukraine, a victory for Russia,\u201d the senior EU official said.\n\nAgreement will for once be far easier on the EU\u2019s stiff economic sanctions against Russia over the war in Ukraine, which were imposed in 2014 after the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande will debrief leaders after which \u201cI expect that there will be a consensus\u201d on a six-month rollover, a German government official said.\n\nThe rollover is expected despite little appetite among some countries, and fears that US President-elect Donald Trump is set to take take a much softer line on Moscow amid signs of rapprochement with Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe EU leaders are however set to stop short of threatening any new sanctions against Russia over the violence in Syria\u2019s Aleppo, where the army has seized nearly all the ravaged city.\n\nThe leaders will say in a statement obtained by AFP that the EU \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d the assault by the \u201cSyrian regime and its allies, notably Russia\u201d and calls on them to allow aid in to Aleppo.\n\nBut they will go little further than they did at their last summit in October when they were equally divided, saying only in a draft statement obtained by AFP that \u201cthe EU is considering all available options.\u201d\n\n\u2013 No dinner for UK PM \u2013\n\nBritain\u2019s May will then leave the summit while the other 27 discuss the process for dealing with Britain\u2019s departure once May triggers the two-year divorce process, which she has promised to do by the end of March 2017.\n\nThey will issue a statement saying they agree to launch talks as quickly as possible after she does so.\n\nThe 27 will also agree that the European Commission will lead the talks, under French chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, but that the European Council of member states must also be involved in the talks.\n\nBut that has prompted an angry response from European Parliament chief Martin Schulz, who warned that MEPs could reject any deal with \u201cgrave consequences\u201d unless they are also included.\n\nAt the moment MEPs must approve any deal but will not be represented in the talks.\n\nThe EU 27 have refused all negotiations with Britain until the process begins, while warning that May is likely to have only a short window until October 2018 to broker a deal.\n\nBrexit minister David Davis said Wednesday a transitional deal to cover the period after the two years before a full trade agreement is reached was possible \u201cif necessary\u201d.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.1018385887146005, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0,

"wordcount_as_scraped": 662, "date": "20161212050000", "story_content": "Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, is planning to build 330 units of housing near its headquarters in what is seen as a response to the housing and rental crisis that has beleaguered Bay Area residents who are seeking more affordable, and often dangerous, alternatives to traditional living accommodations.\n\nAccording to the San Francisco Chronicle, the development would reportedly prioritize housing for people working in the city, but would not be limited to Google employees. Google reportedly employs more than 20,000 people in a city of 80,000.\n\nFacebook has also reportedly announced plans to develop 1,500 units of housing on its property in Menlo Park, and is donating $20 million to developing a community partnership that will\u00a0aim to support affordable housing. The Chronicle notes that approximately 15 percent of those units built would reportedly be designated as subsidized housing units.\n\nWhile there is no simple solution to curbing the ever-expanding housing crisis Bay Area residents are facing, it has been suggested that investing in public transportation and increasing housing near those areas will be a big help, in addition to controlling the region\u2019s job growth rates.\n\nThe area\u2019s traffic problems are another reason so many are intent on investing in residential units near public transportation.\n\nFor example, SiliconValley.com\u00a0reports that in\u00a0Milipitas, a transit village development known as The Fields will offer residents housing nearby links to mass transit and will consist of apartments, an organic grocery store, a hotel, and stores and restaurants.\n\nThe Fields will reportedly include\u00a01,185 apartment rentals, 150,000 square feet of high-end retail, and a 200-room Virgin Hotel. It is also located close to the BART, which will help ease the pain of traffic-riddled commutes so many residents face on a daily basis.\n\nHowever, those units are not nearly enough to scratch the surface in regards to addressing the Bay Area\u2019s housing crisis \u2014 an issue that has been highlighted\u00a0with the deadly Oakland \u201cGhost Ship\u201d warehouse fire that claimed 36 lives.\n\nThe fire has prompted city officials throughout the Golden State to clamp down on similar warehouses, delivering\u00a0eviction notices in the hope of preventing\u00a0such situations in the future. Some were able to live in the Ghost Ship for as little as $300 a month in a city where rents average $2,700 per month.\n\nThe fire has also prompted crackdowns on other popular venues with living situations similar to those in the Oakland warehouse where 36 people perished.\n\nJust last week, the\u00a0legendary Richmond-based underground punk venue Burnt Ramen was described as the city\u2019s \u201cown Ghost Ship\u201d by Mayor Tom Butt. According to the Easy Bay Express, Butt clarified that while he did not want to shut it down \u2014 citing it as \u201cgrandfathered in\u201d \u2014 he does want to see it inspected every three years.\n\nThe Ghost Ship warehouse is owned by Chor Ng, 62, a Bay Area landlord who reportedly owns several other businesses, including a bakery, a flower shop, a Buddhist temple and a massage parlor. According to the\u00a0Chronicle, Ng has owned the warehouse since 1988, and was described by her tenants as a quiet landlord who did not interfere with their businesses.\n\nThe Ghost Ship was not permitted for residential use or entertainment purposes due to fire hazards.\n\nThe bulk of the blame has landed on Derick Ion Almena, who ran the underground artistic community. The\u00a0Chronicle notes that he told Ng about problems, including electrical wiring issues, and was allegedly told to pay out of pocket for them to be fixed.\n\nHowever, like many of the residents in the artistic collective, Almena said he could not afford to pay and has stated that he would put on parties and events in the warehouse in order to help pay for rent. A former resident of the Ghost Ship told Breitbart News that Almena was often taken advantage of by other people, including those the man described as the \u201cBurning Man crowd.\u201d\n\nFollow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope\u00a0@AdelleNaz", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.66898465156555, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 662, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.02055552463, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 10, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161212050000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.5105740181268899, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.909090909091}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/12/16/colorado-judge-rules-against-faithless-electors-seeking-to-block-trump-presidency/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [325, 562, 595, 1461, 1690, 1710, 2560, 2568, 2757, 2936, 3011, 3080, 3094, 3123, 3250, 3856]}}, "headline": "Colorado Judge Rules Against \u2018Faithless\u2019 Electors Seeking to Block Trump Presidency", "wordcount_as_scraped": 611, "date": "20161217020000", "story_content": "Denver, Colorado District Judge Elizabeth Starrs has ruled against the state\u2019s \u201cfaithless\u201d electors who sought to defy the voters\u2019 will by using Electoral Votes for Hillary Clinton to prevent President-elect Donald Trump from ascending to the\u00a0White House.\n\nThe judge reportedly warned they could face criminal charges if they defy her court order.\n\n\u201cIf [presidential electors] take the oath and then they violate the statute, there will be repercussions,\u201d Starrs said in an order\u00a0from the bench, according to the\u00a0Denver Post. The phrase \u201cfaithless\u201d electors refers to individuals who break away from the party\u2019s pledged candidate and who refuse to vote for their state\u2019s choice candidate.\n\nIn this case, Hillary Clinton won Colorado and gained nine Electoral College votes. Judge Starr\u2019s order means those nine electors must vote for Clinton and could face replacement, and possibly jail time, if they fail to do so.\n\nThe electors in each state will meet and cast their votes for the president and vice president on separate ballots on Monday, December 19.\n\nJudge Starr\u2019s ruling was in response to two Democrats among the state\u2019s nine electors who had sued in an attempt to be freed from laws binding them to vote for the candidate who won their state\u2019s popular vote, so they could join other Republican electors who are allegedly attempting to block Trump.\n\nJudge Starr\u2019s court\u00a0order reportedly also granted authority to Colorado\u2019s Republican Secretary of State Wayne Williams to replace electors \u2014 collectively referring to themselves as the \u201cHamilton Electors\u201d movement \u2014 who violate the law. (The phrase\u00a0\u201cHamilton\u201d Electors\u00a0is a reference to Alexander Hamilton\u2019s argument in Federalist No. 68 that the Electoral College would be a special, elite deliberative body: \u201cA small number of persons, selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated investigations.\u201d)\n\nSome of the \u201cfaithless\u201d electors are taking cues from Harvard University constitutional law professor and former 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Larry Lessig, who is offering pro-bono legal counsel to Republican electors who are considering blocking Trump, through his anti-Trump non-profit known as the \u201cElector\u2019s Trust.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Lessig claimed that he has up to 20 Republican electoral college voters who plan on voting against Trump in order to block his confirmation as America\u2019s 45th president,\u00a0saying,\u00a0\u201cWe now believe there are more than half the number needed to change the result seriously considering making that vote.\u201d\n\nHowever, only one \u201cfaithless\u201d Republican Electoral College member,\u00a0Chris Suprun of Texas, has publicly declared that he would vote for someone other than Trump. Texas state law does not mandate that the electors vote for the winner of the state.\u00a0\n\nTo block a Trump presidency, 37 electors would have to vote against him.\u00a0A person needs to achieve 270 votes to win in the Electoral College.\u00a0Trump has won\u00a0306 Electoral College votes.\u00a0Clinton won 232.\n\nLessig\u2019s claims contradict the assertions of sources within the Republican National Committee who reportedly\u00a0say they are calling and monitoring the social media accounts of electors who are in question.\n\nAlthough a few Republican electors have been critical of Trump, they still intend to vote for him. Oklahoma GOP elector Charlie Potts, for example, told Politico, \u201cI would prefer that another person had been nominated by the Republican Party and had won the election, but am I going to go against 14 million [primary voters] who voted for Trump? And am I going to vote against all the people in Oklahoma who voted two-to-one for Trump?

Unsurprisingly, the first country to make spanking illegal was Sweden, in 1979, followed by Finland in 1983. The last to join the list before France in 2016 were Mongolia, Paraguay and Slovenia.\n\nThe decision of the French parliament follows a symbolic reprimand by the Council of Europe in 2015 decrying France's lack of a specific law \"prohibiting corporal punishment in a clear, binding and precise way, including slaps and spankings, in breach of Article 17 of the European Charter of Social Rights.\"\n\n\"To comply with Article 17, states' domestic law must prohibit and penalize all forms of violence against children,\" the Charter states, and the relevant provisions \"must be sufficiently clear, binding and precise, so as to preclude the courts from refusing to apply them to violence against children.\"\n\nThe legislation barring all corporal punishment reportedly relies on the opinion of a majority of psychologists that such forms of discipline are ineffective or counterproductive.\n\nDr. Gustavo Pietropolli Charmet, a psychiatrist and chairman of the Italian non-profit Help Center for Mistreated Children, said that laws prohibiting corporal punishment are useful because it has become clear that \"the educational value of physical and moral pain is zero.\"\n\nSuffering \"does not strengthen education and does not improve self-esteem,\" Charmet said. \"In fact, it can create guilt, fear and vengeance.\"\n\nCommenters were quick to express their approval or disapproval with France's decision.\n\n\"Life also smacks us from time to time. Will we eliminate those as well? Useless psychologists,\" wrote Giulio Francomanno.\n\nAnother reader noted that spanking \"anticipates the lesson that children will learn from life as they grow up, namely, that if you do not respect certain rules, there will be consequences.\"\n\nIn February 2015, Pope Francis expressed his approval\u00a0of parents who spank their kids, as long as it is carried out with respect for their dignity. His words drew a wave of reactions, both negative and positive, to the idea that corporal punishment is okay.\n\n\"It is disappointing that anyone with that sort of influence would make such a comment,\" said Peter Newell, the coordinator of the Global Alliance to End Corporal Punishment of Children.\n\nDespite the extensive debate regarding the value or detriment of corporal punishment, few have questioned the more problematic aspect of a creeping intromission of the state in the lives of families and their choice of how to educate their children.\n\nThe Catholic Church teaches that the state should not interfere with parents' education of children except in grave and extraordinary circumstances.\n\n\"Since parents have given children their life, they are bound by the most serious obligation to educate their offspring and therefore must be recognized as the primary and principal educators,\" Catholic doctrine states.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

Grassroots parent activists who have been battling the Core in their states, however, say they have learned the meaning of these other terms as well.\n\nUpon her nomination as secretary of education, DeVos herself denied she supports Common Core, stating, \"Certainly. I am not a supporter\u2014period.\u00a0I do support high standards, strong accountability, and local control.\"\n\nThe organizations she has funded and served as either a board member or chairman, however, have promoted the controversial standards, including Jeb Bush's Foundation for Excellence in Education, referenced by Ross.\n\nOhio parent activist Heidi Huber observes to Breitbart News that Ross clearly \"considers DeVos' work with Jeb Bush as a top qualification.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, Mr. Ross must have missed news of the really low international performance of the first Common Core generation,\" Huber states, and continues:\n\nPer the recently released TIMSS and PISA reports, American students are losing ground against their international peers since the introduction of the Common Core standards. Just a small application of discernment by the Trump transition team should disqualify anyone involved in this education reform disaster, much less a known leader and financier, from serving in the \u201cNo Common Core\u201d promised administration. The question that begs to be answered, \u201cWho would care what Betsy DeVos\u2019 opinions were on education if she wasn\u2019t a billionaire who could bankroll her supporters\u2019 special interests and think tanks?\u201d\n\nLouisiana parent activist Sara Wood notes to Breitbart News as well, \"Common Core was never proven to be international or competitive.\"\n\nWood states:\n\nAs a parent, I would like to know what on earth qualifies DeVos with the knowledge required to develop \u201cinternationally competitive performance standards\u201d that were \u201cvoluntarily\u201d forced on all students of this nation, as we are experiencing with the disastrous Common Core? DeVos\u2019 resume seems more filled with experience in writing donor checks and in obtaining fancy board memberships, as a result of those donations, than anything that would qualify her to run the U.S. Department of Education or to develop standards for anything, least of all education.\n\nWood says the choice of DeVos is disturbing to the thousands of parents who have been fighting the establishment elites and big business and industry groups that support Common Core:\n\nAll of this should unsettle anyone who has been fighting the Common Core, not just as damaging standards, but as a Trojan horse disguising and distracting from the entire initiative to centralize education in America, leaving no choice but the choice of educating children to the lowest common denominator. Concerned citizens, like myself, who supported Trump because of his promise to get rid of Common Core and restore local control of education, should be alarmed by this decision. Praises from the likes of Ross and Jeb Bush only puts us on notice that those promises are in jeopardy and that the battle for the minds of our children is far from over.\n\nNew Hampshire education activist with Cornerstone Ann Marie Banfield also recognizes the Common Core references in Ross' responses.\n\n\"He referenced her working on high, internationally competitive performance standards in collaboration with Jeb Bush,\" she tells Breitbart News. \"What high performing countries, do the Common Core Standards align to?\u00a0I asked this question directly to Marc Tucker \u2013 one of the chief architects of Common Core when he came to New Hampshire \u2013 and he couldn\u2019t name one.\"\n\nBanfield continues:\n\nHow are we supposed to have confidence in a person who worked against parents fighting for better quality standards for their children?\nCommon Core is a complete redesign of public education in America. DeVos hasn\u2019t mentioned the data-mining on students or the dumbed down competency based workforce training model that is eroding academic content in our local schools.\nAny person appointed to the U.S. Department of Education should offer a detailed plan to undo the failed Obama education reforms. Instead we received a brief statement from DeVos stating she opposes Common Core. That contradicts her position on Common Core in the past.\nThe endorsements by Jeb Bush and former Clinton official Ross offer opponents of Common Core no real assurance that anything will improve. It actually makes me even more convinced this was the wrong choice.\n\nJoining President-elect Donald Trump at a \"Thank You\" tour rally in her home state of Michigan last week, DeVos said in prepared remarks she would be \"finally putting an end to the federalized Common Core.\"\n\n\"DeVos' parsing on Common Core is going to become harder to maintain the more she speaks on education\u2026[her] use of the qualifier 'federalized' is telling,\"\u00a0Karen Braun, who writes at Stop Common Core in Michigan, says. \"DeVos likely believes Common Core is a high standard and a quality choice for states; otherwise she would be with us at Stop Common Core in Michigan, fighting it to get it out, and replacing it with the pre-Common Core Massachusetts standards.\u00a0She's not.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.29296875, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 953, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.6663911618, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161215210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.57397691500525, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/12/15/walmart-selling-black-lives-matter-shirts-bulletproof/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [518, 977, 997, 2084, 2339, 2537, 2626, 3013, 3626, 3655, 3712, 3930, 4071, 4165, 4169, 4572, 5215, 6410, 6669, 7066, 7200]}}, "headline": "Walmart Selling Black Lives Matter Shirts with \u2018Bulletproof\u2019 on Them", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1167, "date": "20161215200000", "story_content": "Walmart is selling Black Lives Matter clothing and other items amid calls to designate the movement as a hate or terrorist effort.

As reported by Breitbart News and the Independent, the huge chain released a statement that said, \"We never want to offend anyone with the products that we offer. We have taken steps to remove all items promoting the Confederate flag from our assortment \u2014 whether in our stores or on our web site.\u201d The move came after Dylann Roof murdered parishioners at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina in June 2015.

His murder also followed several protests in Waller County where Black Lives Matter activists and members of the New Black Panther Party called for the killing of whites and white police officers.\u00a0Members of the armed New Black Panther Party stood across from a line of Harris County Sheriff Mounted Patrol deputies at the jail and chanted \"We will start creeping up on you in the darkness.\" They also yelled \"Off the pigs,\" and \"Oink oink, bang bang.\"\n\nMicah Xavier Johnson, the Nation of Islam sympathizer and former Houston New Black Panther member who gunned down 11 police officers in Dallas in July said he wanted to kill cops, especially white cops, as reported by Breitbart Texas. Johnson started shooting at the close of a Black Lives Matter protest. A BLM activist thanked the cop killer on Twitter.\u00a0Bill O\u2019Reilly called Johnson\u00a0\u201ca hater and a terrorist.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News reported that\u00a0Black Lives Matter activists tried to disrupt the Minnesota State Fair and marched chanting: \"Pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon!\" Black Lives Matter activists pay homage to cop killer Assata Shakur at every event.\u00a0The phrase \"pigs in a blanket\" refers to police officers in body bags and is a call for the killing of police officers.\n\nRev. Peterson said,\u00a0describing Black Lives Matter, \u201cthey're no different than the skinheads or the KKK.\u201d He said,\u00a0\"If\u00a0Black Lives Matter was a white radical group, doing exactly what these black people are doing, they would be shut down. America would not allow that to happen.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News reported in July that there was a petition drive to officially designate Black Lives Matter as a terrorist organization. Over 141,000 signed the petition. The White House rejected the petition.\n\nMilo called Black Lives Matter\u00a0\u201cthe last socially acceptable hate group.\u201d In September he told those gathered to hear him at the University of Houston, \"We are entering the black power phase of Black Lives Matter existence and it is crossing over into a terrorist organisation. It's time to criminalize it.\u201d\n\nBlack Lives Matter supporters celebrated after the murder of three Baton Rouge police officers in July, and used a Twitter hashtag #FuckParis after Islamic terrorists killed scores of people at a concert in Paris, France in November 2015.\n\nPresident Obama has refused to denounce the group and has thanked Black Lives Matter activists for their \u201coutstanding work.\u201d\u00a0President Obama's senior adviser Valerie Jarrett met with Black Lives Matter activists on September 16, 2015 at the White House, as reported by Breitbart News.\n\nDonald Trump, now president-elect, said in early September 2015 that BLM activists were \u201ctrouble\u201d and added, \u201cI think it\u2019s disgraceful the way they\u2019re being catered to by the Democrats.\u201d He was on the \u201cO\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d when he made these comments. He also said, \u201cI saw them with hate.\u201d\n\nThe rhetoric of those in BLM is now getting push-back in the court system.\n\nBreitbart Texas reported in mid-September that the leader of a Dallas police organization sued a collection of Black Lives Matter figureheads and other prominent individuals for allegedly inciting racial violence against American police officers. Apart from founding members and public faces related to Black Lives Matter, Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam; Rev. Al Sharpton and the National Action Network; Malik Zulu Shabazz and the New Black Panthers; George Soros; President Barack Obama; former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder; and Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton were all named as defendants in the lawsuit.\n\nThe father of one of the officers\u00a0executed in Dallas in July filed a lawsuit in November against Black Lives Matter, Rev.

Who knows how many finalists there will be?\u201d\n\nThe remark comes a week after Trump\u2019s aides confirmed that the president-elect had settled on four finalists for the post. Two people close to the transition told The Associated Press that Trump is moving away from two of the four: former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee.\n\nThat would leave Petraeus as a contender, along with Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Both people close to the transition said Trump\u2019s prolonged decision-making process has left the door open to other options. Among other possibilities, one official says is Jon Huntsman, a former Republican Utah governor who also served as the ambassador to China and speaks Mandarin.\n\nThe people close to the transition spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the private process publicly.\n\nThere was other evidence that Trump is looking beyond the known four contenders. Vice President-elect Mike Pence on Sunday listed the quartet, but added a fresh reference to former U.N. ambassador \u201cJohn Bolton or others who may be added to the list\u201d of candidates.\n\n\u201cI think the person who will make the decision about our next secretary of state is the president-elect,\u201d Pence said on ABC. \u201cAnd he\u2019ll factor the totality of Gen. Petraeus\u2019 career in making that decision.\u201d\n\nPence also referred to Petraeus as a \u201chero.\u201d But it seemed unclear Sunday even to Petraeus and Trump\u2019s inner circle whether the retired general\u2019s guilty plea has turned off Trump.\n\nPetraeus, a retired four-star general, pleaded guilty last year to one misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified information relating to documents he had provided to a woman he was having a sexual relationship with. He was spared prison time under a plea agreement with the Justice Department and was given two years\u2019 probation.\n\nFBI Director James Comey has drawn a distinction between Petraeus\u2019 case and that of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton by saying there was no evidence that Clinton or her aides had intended to break the law through careless handling of sensitive information. Federal prosecutors said Petraeus knew black binders he shared contained classified information, but he nonetheless provided them.\n\n\u201cI made a mistake. I have again acknowledged it,\u201d Petraeus said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201dFolks will have to factor that in and determine whether that is indeed disqualifying or not.\u201d\n\nThe remarks come as Trump struggles to fill one of the most visible and prestigious positions in any presidential administration. The secretary of state will steer Trump\u2019s foreign policy agenda, which the president-elect has said would include renegotiating key trade deals and the pact aimed at keeping Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. But for all his business acumen, Trump has no experience with government diplomacy. He\u2019s most recently drawn criticism for speaking with Taiwan\u2019s leader that contradicted U.S. practice and prompted a complaint from China.\n\nPetraeus acknowledged that he loaned Paula Broadwell eight binders containing highly classified information regarding war strategy, intelligence capabilities and identities of covert officers. Petraeus kept the binders in an unlocked desk drawer at his home, instead of a secure facility that\u2019s required for handling classified material.\n\nWhen initially questioned by the FBI, he denied having given Broadwell classified information. Petraeus avoided being charged with making a false statement under his plea deal.\n\n\u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t think it was false,\u201d Petraeus said Sunday.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jonathan Lemire in New York contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Kellman on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/APLaurieKellman", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.03488373756409, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 637, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 0.9958591954639999, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 3, "mft_sum": 10, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161205020000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.56985871271586, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.909090909091}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/01/02/china-demands-socialist-family-values-2017/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [267, 692, 1085, 1581, 1912, 1994, 2070, 2183, 2260, 2380, 2560, 2584, 3309, 3504, 4823, 5325, 5341]}}, "headline": "China\u2019s Xi Calls for \u2018Socialist Family Values\u2019 in 2017 as Anti-Beijing Sentiment Grows", "wordcount_as_scraped": 860, "date": "20170103020000", "story_content": "The Chinese state news agency Xinhua is promoting statements by President Xi Jinping made last month demanding a \u201cnew trend toward socialist family values\u201d in China as the Communist\u00a0Party faces a 2017 teeming with new challenges from separatist groups, religious minorities, and even Maoists who reject Xi\u2019s autocratic capitalist reforms.\n\nXi made the comments at a conference \u201cto honor model families\u201d in December, according to Xinhua, defining \u201csocialist family values\u201d as \u201clove for the nation, family and one another, devotion to progress and kindness, and mutual growth and sharing.\u201d His New Year\u2019s Eve\u00a0address appeared to promote more of the same, demanding the Chinese people \u201cwork harder\u201d to aid the Communist Party\u2019s progress both nationally and globally.\n\n\u201cAs long as our 1.3 billion-plus people are pulled together for a common cause, as long as the Party stands together with the people and we roll up our sleeves to work harder, we will surely succeed in a Long March of our generation,\u201d\u00a0Xi reportedly said in his address.\n\nHe made clear that the values he seeks to see Chinese families promote are indivisible from Communist Party edicts, reminding listeners that \u201claw is virtue put down in words, and virtue is law borne in people\u2019s hearts.\u201d Xi reportedly urged \u201cfostering a belief in law, the rule of law and rules, and guiding people to voluntarily assume their statutory duties, as well as responsibilities for society and family.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party propaganda outlet\u00a0The People\u2019s Daily reported that Chinese citizens online \u201cresponded enthusiastically to President Xi Jinping\u2019s New Year\u2019s address, equally impressed by the content and inspirational phrasing of the speech.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese media outlets\u2019 emphasis on family values are contrasted with Western-style popular culture on the pages of the\u00a0Global Times, another English-language propaganda outlet. While China\u2019s president\u00a0has repeatedly dwelled on \u201csocialist family values\u201d in recent speeches, the\u00a0Times has decried reality show participants and celebrity divorcees as indicative of a trend of immaturity among\u00a0young Chinese people.\n\nThe major culprit appears to be a reality show called\u00a0Chinese-Style Blind Dating, where parents get a say in whether a contestant\u2019s romantic prospects are good for them. The\u00a0Times complains that too many men on the show are \u201cnot looking for true love or their other half, but a mother\u201d and cites an \u201cexpert\u201d \u2014 Chinese psychoanalyst Wu Zhihong, author of\u00a0Nation of Giant Infants\u00a0\u2014 who protests that \u201cthe majority\u201d of Chinese people \u201care stuck at the level of a 6-month-old infant.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for Xi, many of those who are perturbed by the comfortable lives of China\u2019s elite \u2014 the \u201cgiant infants\u201d likely targeted by the call for \u201csocialist family values\u201d \u2014 are Maoists who blame Xi and his embrace of globalist elitism for the devolution in Communist loyalties in China. These Communists, dubbed \u201cNeo-Maoists\u201d or the \u201cNew Left,\u201d see Xi as a force perverting true Communism to allow business to flourish in the nation.\n\n\"Chairman Mao was a truly great man but this is not the country he dreamt of, this is not real communism,\" an unnamed university professor who identifies with the movement told the\u00a0Financial Times in September. \"The economy today is dominated by monopoly industries controlled by the children of senior officials. The current government, led by Xi Jinping, is very bad.\"\n\nThe\u00a0Financial Times cites experts who suspect that neo-Maoism, largely driven by an educational system that promotes cult worship of Mao without discussing the tens of millions killed by his regime, \u201cwould probably win a general election in China today, should free elections ever be allowed.\u201d CNBC describes neo-Maoism as a \u201cgrowing populist movement\u201d that may threaten Xi\u2019s rule in the near future.\n\nMaoists are but one on the long list of enemies Xi has cultivated as head of the Party. Entering 2017, Beijing faces the growing threat of separatist movements emboldened, in part, by the changing of the guard at the White House. Paramount among these are Taiwan\u2019s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), led by President Tsai Ing-wen, expected to visit the United States briefly later this month.\n\nTsai enraged China in November by calling President-elect Donald Trump and congratulating him on his election victory. Beijing repeatedly condemned Trump\u2019s decision to accept the reportedly benign call, a move apparently designed to curb not only Tsai but anti-Beijing leaders in Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang, all regions seeking to escape the Communist Party on the east coast.\n\nXi has also presided over an astronomical growth in the number of Chinese Christians. China now produces more Bibles than anywhere in the world\u00a0and is experiencing a boom in underground \u201chouse\u201d churches unencumbered by Beijing\u2019s Communist agenda. Xi has responded by cracking down on house churches, which tend to be Protestant, and pushing away from the Vatican.\n\nLast week, China\u2019s Catholic Church, controlled by Beijing, officially split from Rome. \u201cSticking to the principle of independence and self-governance as well as a system of national congresses embodies the self-esteem and confidence of the Catholic Church in China,\u201d the severance\u00a0statement read.\u00a0Among Beijing\u2019s objections against the Vatican is its recognition of the sovereignty of Taiwan.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 30, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.106496274471283, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 836, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 10, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 8.49598835815, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 4, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 30, "mft_sum": 55, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170103020000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 6.57894736842105, "mft_mean": 5.0}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/12/05/john-kerrys-dangerous-ignorance-israeli-palestinian-conflict/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3635, 5519, 5544, 5558]}}, "headline": "Klein: John Kerry's Dangerous Ignorance On The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict", "wordcount_as_scraped": 852, "date": "20161206040000", "story_content": "TEL AVIV \u2013 Speaking to the Saban Forum in Washington, Secretary of State John Kerry demonstrated dangerous ignorance of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and a biased perception of the core problems impeding peace between the two sides.\n\nFirstly, Kerry claimed the larger Arab world will not make peace with Israel until Israelis and Palestinians sign a deal ostensibly resulting in a Palestinian state.\n\n\"There will be no separate peace between Israel and the Arab world \u2013 I want to make that clear to all of you,\" Kerry lectured, \"without the Palestinian process and without Palestinian peace.\"\n\nPerhaps the esteemed diplomat forgot that Israel already signed peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan, two moderate Arab countries that enjoy normalized relations with the Jewish state despite the absence of an Israeli-Palestinian deal.\n\nAnd Kerry may have missed that under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, there have been numerous reports of security cooperation between Israel and Sunni Arab states like Saudi Arabia that are deeply concerned by the U.S.-led nuclear deal with Iran.\n\nKerry, meanwhile, continued the Obama administration's singular obsession with settlement activity, believing that Jewish construction in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem serves as a major obstacle to peace.\n\nHe replied to Netanyahu's accurate statement at the same forum that the essential issue blocking a peace deal is not settlement activity but the Palestinians' longstanding refusal to recognize Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people.\n\n\"I don't agree with him that settlements are not an obstacle to peace,\" Kerry said. \"Let's not kid ourselves here \u2013 you can't just wipe it away by saying it doesn't have an impact. It has an impact.\u201d\n\n\"I'm not here to say that settlements are the reason for the conflict. No, they're not,\" he continued. \"But I also cannot accept the notion that they're not a barrier to peace.\"\n\nOnce again, Kerry ignores history. In this case, he glossed over Israel's numerous previous offers to evacuate settlements in exchange for peace deals, including offers of a Palestinian state at Camp David in 2000 and Annapolis in 2007. In each of these cases, the PA refused generous Israeli offers of statehood and bolted negotiations without counteroffers.\n\nWhile highlighting Jewish construction, Kerry was strangely silent on rampant illegal Palestinian construction on Jewish-owned property in eastern sections of Jerusalem, including the construction of dozens of apartment buildings on about 270 acres in the Jerusalem neighborhoods of Qalandiya and Kfar Akev, and about 50 acres in a north Jerusalem suburb known as Shoafat. The land is indisputably owned by a U.S.-based Jewish group.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority and much of the international community says Israel is occupying the so-called pre-1967 borders, meaning the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and eastern Jerusalem, including the Temple Mount. Israel refers to the pre-1967 territories as disputed.\n\nAbbas's Fatah party, Hamas, and other major Palestinian factions routinely refer to the entire state of Israel as \"occupied\" territory.\n\nKerry\u2019s views on settlement activity seem at odds with the intent of United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, the only binding resolution pertaining to the West Bank, which calls on Israel to withdraw under a future final-status solution \"from territories occupied\" as a result of the 1967 Six Day War. The resolution does not call for a withdrawal from \"all territories,\" a designation deliberately left out to ensure Israel's ability\u00a0to retain some territory for security purposes under a future deal.\n\nThe Jewish Virtual Library explains:\n\nThe Security Council did not say Israel must withdraw from \"all the\" territories occupied after the Six-Day War. This was quite deliberate. The Soviet delegate wanted the inclusion of those words and said that their exclusion meant \"that part of these territories can remain in Israeli hands.\" The Arab states pushed for the word \"all\" to be included, but this was rejected. They nevertheless asserted that they would read the resolution as if it included the word \"all.\" The British ambassador who drafted the approved resolution, Lord Caradon, declared after the vote: \"It is only the resolution that will bind us, and we regard its wording as clear.\"\n\nPerhaps most dangerously, Kerry took the occasion of the Saban Forum to refuse to confirm that the U.S. would veto any United Nations resolution intended to set guidelines for the establishment of a Palestinian state, allowing only that the Obama administration would veto a resolution \"if it is a biased, unfair resolution calculated to delegitimize Israel.\"\n\nThe Palestinians' UN campaign is a farce. If the PA wanted a state, Palestinian leaders would at least respond to Netanyahu's open-ended willingness to begin talks instead of repeatedly refusing to come to the bargaining table.\n\nThe same PA that now seeks to unilaterally impose a solution at the UN failed to respond to Netanyahu's unprecedented steps to jump-start negotiations aimed at creating a Palestinian state, including freezing Jewish construction in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem and releasing Palestinian prisoners.\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

We\u2019re going to win with healthcare and for our veterans. We\u2019re going to win with every single facet. We\u2019re going to win so much you may even get tired of winning. And you\u2019ll say \u2018please, please it\u2019s too much winning. We can\u2019t take it anymore. Mr. President, it\u2019s too much!\u2019 And I\u2019ll say \u2018no, it isn\u2019t, we have to keep winning! We have to win more! We\u2019re going to win more!\u2019\n\n\n\nTrump would go on to win his home state of New York just days later with nearly 60 percent, shocking the world by taking 89 of the state\u2019s 95 delegates and essentially securing the GOP nomination\u2013which he would officially wrap up two weeks later in Indiana.\n\nThis Albany rally isn\u2019t the first time that Trump used that phrase, though. He used it in Ohio back in March:\n\n\n\nBack in 2015, at the Stop Iran\u00a0Deal Rally on Capitol Hill on Sept. 9, Trump used a similar phrase\u2013that if he won, people may get \u201cbored\u201d with winning.\n\n\n\nAnd here Trump is using the line in Oklahoma:\n\n\n\n2.) \u201cThe Wall Just Got 10 Feet Higher\u201d\n\nWhen Mexico\u2019s leaders said that under no circumstances will they pay for the wall that Trump will build on the U.S.-Mexican border\u2013as Trump insists that Mexico will pay for it\u2013Trump announced to a Tampa rally that his comment in response was that: \u201cThe Wall Just Got 10 Feet higher.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are so tired of being pushed around by these other countries like we\u2019re a bunch of dummies,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNot going to happen anymore. Not going to happen. Not going to happen.\u201d\n\n3.) \u201cOnly Rosie O\u2019Donnell\u201d\n\nAnti-Trump Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly\u2013who had been trying to tank his candidacy from the get-go\u2013came at him viciously in the first GOP primary debate in Cleveland, accusing him of making disparaging remarks towards women. After reading off a series of comments Trump allegedly made, Trump joked in response that he said those things about \u201cOnly Rosie O\u2019Donnell.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat moment sealed Kelly\u2019s fate as having given up journalism for anti-Trump activism, and made her\u00a0no longer the hero many Fox News viewers once thought she was. It also set the two\u2013Trump and Kelly\u2013on a collision-course through the rest of 2015 and 2016, which even led to Trump canceling his appearance at the last primary debate in Des Moines, Iowa, before the caucuses, which Kelly was supposed to co-moderate.\n\n4.) Trump Steaks, Wine, Water, Magazine and Airlines\n\nAfter Mitt Romney, the failed GOP nominee from 2012 who couldn\u2019t beat now-outgoing Democratic president Barack Obama, attacked his brands during a speech in the GOP primaries in 2016, Trump held a press conference following\u00a0his victories in both Michigan and Mississippi in which\u00a0he touted his products. It is worth noting that Romney wasn\u2019t strong enough to run himself against Trump in 2016, and wouldn\u2019t even endorse a single one of his opponents.\n\n\n\n5.) Trump Holds Panel With Clinton Accusers Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey and Kathy Shelton Before St. Louis Debate\n\nIn one of the boldest political moves in history, Trump\u2013under fire from the release of the Access Hollywood tape on which he made vulgar remarks about women\u2013called a special panel together of a number\u00a0of accusers against both Bill and Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nPaula Jones, Kathleen Willey, and Juanita Broaddrick have each leveled a variety of charges against Bill Clinton. Shelton, who was allegedly raped when she was 12-years-old, saw Hillary Clinton defend her rapist.\n\nA media personality attempted to harass Trump at the event, shouting questions at him beforehand and again at the end yelling, \u201cMr. Trump, have you touched women without their consent?\u201d\n\nWhile Trump kept his cool and didn\u2019t engage the media personality\u2019s outlandish questions, Jones did speak up in response: \u201c\"Why don't you go ask Bill Clinton that? Why don't y'all go ask Bill Clinton that? Go ahead\u2014ask Hillary as well.\"\n\nThe entire room applauded Jones for standing up to the media personality and to the Clintons.\n\n6.) Trump to Inner City Detroit with Dr. Ben Carson\n\nAfter he became the nominee and the general election campaign was well under way, Trump faced blistering criticisms from the media over GOP failures in minority communities from previous election cycles. He traveled to inner city Detroit with his former opponent turned ally Dr. Ben Carson\u2013who is going to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in the Trump administration\u2013to speak to the Great Faith Ministries International church.\n\n\n\nThe event\u2013to which Breitbart News accompanied Trump from New York City and back\u2013was a smashing success. The local black community in Detroit loved Trump, and the parishioners were all-too-happy to see him.\n\n#TrumpInDetroit #TrumpTrain pic.twitter.com/jCryQI2AJF\n\u2014 Dan Scavino Jr. (@DanScavino) September 3, 2016\n\n\n\nIt was here that Trump, who had already presented himself as the candidate of change, became the candidate of hope as well.\u00a0\"Our nation is too divided. We talk past each other, not to each other, and those who seek office do not do enough to step into the community and learn what is going on,\" Trump told the church-goers from the podium. \"They don't know. They have no clue. I'm here today to learn. So that we can together remedy injustice, in any form. And so that we can also remedy economics so that the African-American community can benefit economically through jobs and income and so many other different ways.\"\n\nLater in the day, he visited Dr. Carson\u2019s boyhood home in Detroit.\n\n\n\nTrump would go on to win not only the state of Michigan\u2013which hasn\u2019t gone for a Republican president since the 1980s\u2013but more of the black vote than his failed predecessor, Romney.\n\n\u201cWhile black voters overwhelmingly supported Clinton, Trump lost by a narrower margin than his predecessor,\u201d USA Today admitted on the day after election day. \u201cTrump won 8% of the black vote, compared with 6% of the black vote earned by Romney in 2012.\u201d\n\n7.) Trump Meets With Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto\u00a0\n\nBack on Aug. 31, 2016, Trump traveled to Mexico City to meet with Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto\u2013and they both came out to hold a joint press conference after their meeting.\n\n\n\nIt was one of the most surreal moments of the campaign because Trump won the GOP nomination by campaigning for tough immigration enforcement\u2013including the building of a wall along the border that he repeatedly said Mexico will pay for, and the deportation of millions of Mexicans who illegally immigrated into America, as well illegal aliens from other nations\u2013but here he was being as diplomatic as can be with Mexico\u2019s president.\n\nAnd not only that, but later that night Trump traveled to Phoenix, Arizona, to give an immigration policy address in which\u00a0he specifically not only doubled down on every one of his hardline immigration policies but spelled out exactly what he is going to do as president when it comes to restoring sanity to U.S. immigration policy.\n\n\n\n8.) REVOLUTION!\n\nIn New Hampshire after his first primary win in February 2016\u2013at a time when nobody in the establishment thought any of this was possible\u2013Trump came out to the Beatles hit song \u201cRevolution\u201d to give his victory speech.\n\nHe did the same thing the night before in Manchester at his final rally before his first electoral win.\n\n\n\nAs Breitbart News reported at the time, the Beatles song perfectly encapsulates what voting for Trump for president represents: Revolution!\n\n\n\n9.) Trump Crushes Lindsey Graham, Gives Out Senator\u2019s Cell Phone Number\n\nPerhaps one of the funniest moments of Donald Trump\u2019s rise to power came when he gave out South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2019s personal cell phone number after the liberal Republican who supports amnesty for illegal aliens attacked him.\n\n\n\nGraham responded by making a cheesy video demonstrating how to destroy a cell phone:\n\n\n\nTrump would go on to actually win the election. Graham dropped out before people started voting.\n\n10.) Low Energy Jeb Bush\n\nTrump bashed Bush\u2013the original GOP frontrunner for president, whom the donor class had coalesced behind despite his utter failure to win over any real voters\u2013relentlessly throughout the campaign. More on that later in future lists, but this one wouldn\u2019t be complete without mentioning Trump ripping Bush as \u201clow energy.\u201d\n\nHere are a few examples, out of many:\n\n\n\n\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 18, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.8636643886566159, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1468, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.82589434181, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 18, "mft_sum": 41, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 2, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161229020000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.79291553133515, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.72727272727}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/01/07/declassified-intel-report-russian-activities-recent-us-elections-released/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [378]}}, "headline": "Declassified Intel Report on \u2018Russian Activities in Recent U.S. Elections\u2019 Released", "wordcount_as_scraped": 966, "date": "20170107200000", "story_content": "The intelligence community has released the declassified version of its assessment of \u201cRussian Activities and Intentions in Recent U.S. Elections\u201d for public review.\n\nThe first thing to know about the report is that it contains absolutely no evidence about actual Russian actions; it is a series\u00a0of assertions, with varying levels of confidence from various agencies.\n\nMost of these assertions have already been highly publicized in the media, through press statements and leaks, so there are no startling revelations here.\n\nThe classified version of the report presented to President Obama and President-elect Trump included the corroborating evidence the public is not allowed to see, but frankly, a good deal of what is in the declassified IC report looks like it was based on analyzing news reports available to the general public.\n\nFor example, it is asserted that Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201cpublicly pointed to the Panama Papers disclosure and the Olympic doping scandal as U.S.-directed efforts to defame Russia, suggesting he sought to use disclosures to discredit the image of the United States and cast it as hypocritical.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, the report\u2019s key assertions are:\n\nPutin \u201cordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election.\u201d\nRussia\u2019s goals were to \u201cundermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.\u201d\nThe Russian government \u201cdeveloped a clear preference for President-elect Trump.\u201d To this end, they sought to help his election chances by \u201cdiscrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorability to him.\u201d\n\nNotably, the agencies went to great pains to make it clear there is no evidence Russian operatives targeted or compromised systems involved in vote tallying.\n\nAlso, the intelligence community stresses it is not asserting that Russian interference actually changed the outcome of the election: \u201cThe U.S. Intelligence Community is charged with monitoring and asserting the intentions, capabilities, and actions of foreign actors; it does not analyze U.S. political processes or U.S. public opinion.\u201d\n\nThe report notes several times that the Russians have a longstanding interest in undermining \u201cthe U.S.-led liberal democratic order\u201d because they see it as a \u201cthreat to Russia and Putin\u2019s regime.\u201d\n\nThese general efforts were supposedly focused by Putin\u2019s above-mentioned anger at the Panama Papers and Olympic doping scandal, anger at Clinton for \u201cinciting mass protests against his regime in late 2011 and early 2012,\u201d and \u201cbecause he holds a grudge for comments he almost certainly saw as disparaging him.\u201d Again, the documentation that would make any of this more than speculative analysis of news reports from the past few years is missing from the public version of the report.\n\nPutin also reportedly prefers Trump because he \u201chas had many positive experiences working with Western political leaders [that] made them more disposed to deal with Russia.\u201d\n\nAlso, Moscow thought Trump would be more willing to work together on an \u201cinternational counter-terrorism coalition against the Islamic State.\u201d\n\nOne interesting observation from the report is that Moscow believed the conventional wisdom that Clinton was going to win the election. Supposedly, their cyber-espionage tactics then shifted to \u201ccrippling her presidency from its start, including by impugning the fairness of the election.\u201d\n\nThe Russian influence campaign was \u201cmultifaceted and designed to be deniable\u201d by using a mixture of \u201cagents of influence, cutouts, front organizations, and false-flag operations,\u201d not to mention \u201cpaid social media users or \u2018trolls.'\u201d\n\nThe IC asserts that the GRU, Russia\u2019s intelligence directorate, ordered the penetration of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer system, and that WikiLeaks and DCLeaks were used to distribute the information. The \u201cGuccifer 2.0\u201d hacker personality is portrayed as an instrument of the GRU.\n\nIt is noted that the documents disclosed by WikiLeaks \u201cdid not contain any evident forgeries.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Russian media outlets were publicly praising Trump and accusing Clinton of \u201ccorruption, poor physical and mental health, and ties to Islamic extremism.\u201d\n\nThe most substantial supporting documentation in the unclassified version of the IC report consists of clippings from Russian media sources like Sputnik News and RT.com. There is a sizable appendix charting the growing influence of RT.com and tracing its links to Russian politicians and intelligence officials.\n\nThe report concludes that the Russians learned a great deal about running a successful influence operation in 2016 and will continue both using and refining their tactics. The IC states that immediately after Election Day, Russian intelligence launched a new \u201cspearphishing\u201d campaign designed to trick victims into revealing their computer passwords.\n\nIn his statement about the release of the IC report, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) summed up both the arguments advanced by the report, and the media narratives it dispels:\n\nRussia has a track record of working against our interests, and they clearly tried to meddle in our political system. I strongly condemn any outside interference in our elections, which we must work to prevent moving forward.\nWe must also be clear that there is no evidence that there was any interference in the voting or balloting process. We cannot allow partisans to exploit this report in an attempt to delegitimize the president-elect's victory. Donald Trump won this election fair and square because he heard the voices of Americans who felt forgotten.\n\nDonald Trump made a similar point after meeting with intelligence community leaders on Friday morning, shortly before the declassified IC report was released to the public:\n\nWhile Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election, including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines.\n\nTrump promised aggressive action to combat cyberattacks and said, \u201cAmerica\u2019s safety and security will be my number one priority.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.49003982543945, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 926, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.27454472785, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170107200000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.4838012958963303, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2017/01/28/european-leaders-meet-thrash-brexit-response-plan/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [75, 77]}}, "headline": "European Leaders Meet To Thrash Out Brexit, Trump Response Plan", "wordcount_as_scraped": 615, "date": "20170128100000", "story_content": "LISBON (AFP)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Leaders of seven southern European Union nations meet in Lisbon on Saturday to forge a common approach to deal with Britain\u2019s looming exit from the bloc and the new protectionist administration of US President Donald Trump.\n\nThe mostly centre-left leaders taking part in the gathering \u2014 the second by southern EU leaders in four months \u2014 are also expected to renew their push for action to boost flagging growth in the EU and tackle the ongoing migrant crisis.\n\nFaced with the rise of \u201cprotectionism and populism\u201d, the EU needs urgent reforms to \u201csurpass the economic, social and political legitimacy crisis which is weakening it,\u201d Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa, the summit\u2019s host, said Tuesday.\n\nFrench President Francois Hollande and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni are scheduled to take part in the talks, which are due to start at 11:00 am (1100 GMT).

Spending his short life living inside a plastic bubble that sought, unsuccessfully in the end, to protect him from the world of germs outside, he was dubbed \"the bubble boy.\"\n\nAs we look at what is taking place on college campuses around the country today, we are witnessing a similar effort to protect young people from the realities of the world around them. We provide them with \"safe spaces,\" removing any symbols deemed offensive. In shielding students from life's slightest perceived unpleasantries, one wonders if we are not simply raising a generation of overly-protected \"bubble children.\" If so, we need question whether students' best interests are served.\n\nWhile the clarion call for safe space went out as claims of racism were \"being met with a lack of empathy,\" the call seems to have evolved into one seeking to accommodate students easily offended by any opposing viewpoint.\n\nIronically, offended students exercising their own First Amendment rights, by loudly complaining, seek to deny the same rights to those holding opposing views. The safe space concept has been abused to the point college administrators unabashedly provide \"bubble space\" for absurd reasons.\n\nThe call for safe spaces apparently ballooned in the wake of the 2016 presidential election as students proved unable to cope with its outcome.\n\nFor students thusly stressed at the University of Pennsylvania, a dorm made \"Breathing Space\" available. They were offered various stress-reducing activities, such as cuddling cats and a puppy, coloring, crafting or enjoying snacks of soothing teas and chocolates.\n\nFeeling their pain, many professors at Penn canceled classes, turning them into safe space forums \"in which students could freely express their concerns for their futures.\"\n\nInterestingly, an earlier campus poll revealed Hillary Clinton supporters outnumbered Donald Trump's almost ten-to-one. Thus, while Hillary supporters, participating in such classroom forums, discussed their fears about his victory, apparently no similar concerns existed about Trump supporters' fears in expressing themselves within such a pro-Clinton environment.\n\nAt Cornell University, students upset over the election results were allowed to hold a \"cry in.\" Students wrote about their \"emotions on poster boards with colored markers or with chalk on the ground.\" Interestingly, at another university, someone simply writing \"Trump 2016\" in chalk on a sidewalk upset students who claimed they could no longer feel safe.\n\nEven before the election, some universities, such as Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, located only a few miles from the Republican National Convention, felt the need to provide safe space for anyone \"psychologically or physically traumatized\" by the event.\n\nMeanwhile, earlier this year, with Halloween approaching, the University of Florida made counselors available 24/7 should students feel upset over costumes encountered.\n\nAt the University of Iowa, a professor expressed concern a popular item on campus was \"conveying an invitation to aggressivity and even violence,\" possibly even causing depression and promoting a suicide culture among students. The offending item in question was the \"angry\" look frozen on the face of the school's hawk mascot. The professor wrote, \"I believe incoming students should be met with welcoming, nurturing, calm, accepting and happy messages\"\u2014something she felt the hawk's appearance did not convey.\n\nThe University of Wisconsin-Stout, perhaps acting preventively to avoid the need for safe spaces, dispatched a search team to identify anything impressionable incoming students might deem offensive on campus. Coming across two historic paintings of colonial settlers and Native Americans, the team recommended removal fearing the \"harmful effect\" they might have. The administration complied.\n\nAs one critic asks, \"who created these campus whiners?\" He notes campus unrest of the 1960s focused on things of great consequence\u2014the Vietnam war, civil rights, etc. But, today, universities are creating \"whiny college kids\u2026screaming obscenities or taking over the university president's office\u2026for\u2026feeling slighted\u2026(They are) rebels without a cause.\"\n\nSuch coddling of our college students has consequences, not only for them but for the universities as well.\n\nA psychologist writes, as \"college personnel everywhere are struggling with students' neediness,\" universities are creating a serious problem\u2014\"declining student resilience.\" Resilience is described as \"that ineffable quality that allows some people to be knocked down by life and come back stronger than ever. Rather than letting failure overcome them and drain their resolve, they find a way to rise from the ashes.\"\n\nClearly, by promoting a victim culture to students, colleges prime them for failure in the real world.\n\nUniversity alumni are also disgusted with such student pampering, reflected by a downturn in donations. Enrollment suffers too as applications to universities known for coddling, such as the University of Missouri, have drastically declined.\n\nAs American college students seek safe harbor in a protective bubble, it gives one pause to reflect on their counterparts in the Ukraine. Students there must live every day fearing attacks by pro-Russian separatists seeking to topple their government.\n\nAccordingly, many such students have voluntarily joined the Students Guard\u2014an auxiliary guerilla force trained to take up arms in an emergency. Independent of the government, the Guard represents civilian society's concerns about the political realities facing the country. Professors are responsible for preparing these students for war.\n\nAt the Ukraine's Taras Shevchenko National University, a safe space does exist on campus. Students often will stand there, shoulder-to-shoulder, in complete silence.

During that conference, Louderback discussed the impact in Texas these gangs are presenting and how the flood of unaccompanied alien chidren across our southern border is leading to a massive increase in the numbers of MS-13 gang members in Texas and across the U.S.\n\n\"We are inexperienced in seeing the level of brutality, savagery that MS-13 is doing here in Texas,\" the south Texas sheriff told the listeners. \"There are many cases in the Houston area. And out of 20,000 gang members in Houston, about 800 of them are MS-13, Mara Salvatrucha.\"\n\n\"But the violence that they commit in Houston, Harris County, is unbelievable,\" he continued. \"And most of our citizens are unprepared and don't have the knowledge on what's actually going on with these gang members here in the state of Texas. And having the border here in Texas affords us a unique look into exactly what's happening to our country, which appears first most of the time here in Texas.\"\n\n\"We have multiple deportees using machetes, scalping, killing 14-year-olds, 23-year-old gang leaders, you know, luring, you know, kids into a road near Addicks Dam and using a machete, it was four of them, to hack a person to death \u2013 a 14-year-old boy, who allegedly would not murder his cousin, that they were upset about over some issue,\" Louderback stated.\n\nHe is referring to the case recently concluded in Houston where Breitbart Texas reported a MS-13 gang leader was convicted of murdering a 14-year-old boy with a machete. Jose Granados-Guevara, 23, was convicted by state district court Judge Terry Mlenniken following a three-day bench trial. The judge sentenced Granados-Guevara to spend 99 years in a state prison.\n\nThe victim, Jose Meraz, was taken by Granados-Guevara and three other gang members to a wooded area in the west part of Houston near Addicks Dam Road on September 15, 2014. The MS-13 gang members passed the machete around as they killed the boy. Meraz was sentenced to death by Granados-Guevara after he refused to kill his own cousin as part of\u00a0a gang ritual, the Houston Chronicle\u00a0reported.\n\nLouderback continued, talking about a case reported last week by Breitbart Texas where a MS-13 gang member who had previously been deported posed as a music producer with another gang member to lure a 15-year-old girl to Houston where she was repeatedly raped by the two men according to Harris County Sheriff Ron Hickman.\n\n\"We have a 15-year-old girl out of Henderson, Texas who was lured on a social media app, K-I-K or Kik, and also MeetMe.com as MS-13 members that were posing as music talent searchers and talent, able to put her in front of certain folks to enhance her talent,\" Louderback said describing the violent assault. \"[They] took her captive, sexually assaulted her for two days before she was able to get free, get a cellphone, get a hold of 9-1-1. Again, a two-time deportee, MS-13 members. That's what we're faced with, folks.\"\n\n\"We need help. We need help from the federal government,\" Sheriff Louderback pleaded. He continued:\n\nThe state government's actively involved. You know, hat's off to them for what they're doing. But the federal government plays a role here. And our interaction with law enforcement and federal policies that are in place now are reprehensible. They affect law enforcement. They affect our citizens. They affect our taxpayers. And it's not a good situation, by any stretch. And, you know, my vocabulary, I get pretty passionate about this because, you know, Texas sheriffs and Texas law enforcement, you know, our citizens are important to us, as probably in all states. But it's a unique situation here in Texas.\n\nIt is not just a Texas problem. Jessica Vaughn wrote for CIS that the problem effects cities all across the United States. \"The Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, Baltimore, Long Island, Charlotte, Newark, Boston, Atlanta, Miami, and several Texas cities suffer the highest level of MS-13 violence, as shown by ICE arrests,\" Vaugh stated. \"Brentwood, N.Y., on Long Island, a town consumed by MS-13 crime, exemplifies the association between the huge influx of illegal alien minors and MS-13 violence levels. In a town of 60,000, there have been 30 MS-13 murders since 2010; an additional three murders this fall, plus two bodies found from the spring are being attributed to the dangerous gang.\"\n\nVaughn attributed the growing problem to the exploitation of existing law designed to deter human trafficking that now allows these unaccompanied minors unbridled access to American cities. She wrote:\n\nThe increasing MS-13 population and violence results in part from Congress passing the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), which was intended to protect against the trafficking of unaccompanied minors. But the Obama administration has misused the law and allowed in tens of thousands of illegal alien teenagers who are neither unaccompanied nor trafficked. Over last three years the administration has used the law as a pretext to allow over 120,000 minors to remain in the country, resulting in \u201ca national security and public safety crisis,\u201d according to Joe Kolb, a Center fellow and author of the two reports.\n\nVaughn concluded, \"currently an\u00a0average of 260 unaccompanied youths are being allowed in every day, compared to about 150 a day in\u00a02014. Sheriff Louderback speaks for all of the traumatized communities when he said, 'We need help.'\u201d\n\nBob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

This was the largest single month since the massive flood of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) apprehended after crossing the border in June 2014 when 57,862 immigrants were apprehended.\n\nKolb blamed the surge on President Obama's announcement expanding America's refugee programs. Other factors included improved job opportunities in the U.S. over the summer and the continuing violence in Mexico and Central America.\n\nThe National Border Patrol Council's Christopher Harris, who serves as director of legislative and political affairs for the Border Patrol union, told CIS that abuses of the refugee programs are a key factor. He cited the lack of uniformity and inconsistent enforcement. He also said the possibility of Donald Trump being elected was a pull factor.\n\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) told the New York Times, \u201cOnce again, the Obama administration has decided to blow wide open any small discretion it has in order to reward individuals who have no lawful presence in the United States with the ability to bring their family members here. Rather than take the steps necessary to end the ongoing crisis at the border, the Obama administration perpetuates it by abusing a legal tool meant to be used sparingly to bring people to the United States and instead applying it to the masses in Central America.\"\n\nBorder Patrol officials responded to the surge by pulling 150 front-line agents off the border in sectors with their own surge problems and moved them to Texas sectors to assist in processing the growing numbers of illegal immigrants, Breitbart Texas reported earlier this month.\n\nThe 150 agents will be temporarily be transferred from the Tucson, San Diego, and Del Rio Sectors to the McAllen and Weslaco Centralized Processing Centers. The sectors are being robbed of agents are having their own surge of illegal immigrants as Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials try to make it look like they are doing something in response to the renewed humanitarian crisis along the southern border.\n\nThe San Diego Sector reported an increase in Family Unit Aliens (FMUA) apprehensions of 303 percent when comparing FY 2016 and FY 2107 numbers. UAC apprehensions also increased, by 71 percent over the same time period last year. Breitbart Texas reported on October 22 that the San Diego Sector was also dealing with a\u00a0600 percent increase of Haitian refugees comparing FY 2016 to the previous year.\n\nThe Tucson Sector, from where agents are being moved to Texas, also saw an increase in FMUA apprehensions of 17 percent comparing October 2016 to October 2017. Fortunately, UAC apprehensions were down for the month.\n\nEarlier this month, Breitbart Texas\u00a0reported\u00a0that cartel smugglers were using the U.S. elections as a \"marketing tool\" to bring more illegal immigrants to the U.S. border. That marketing ploy was apparently successful.\n\nDuring the month of October, the apprehensions of FMUAs increased by nearly 37 percent over September, according to information obtained from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials by Breitbart Texas. Those numbers have been increasing nearly every month leading up to the election since January. October also saw an increase in the apprehensions of UACs by nearly 19 percent. Those numbers also were increasing nearly every month during 2016. Total apprehensions of all illegal aliens crossing the border in October rose by nearly 17 percent.\n\n\"The smugglers learned in 2014 that they could tie up Border Patrol agents as babysitters and keep us from our primary mission of stopping illegal border crossings and drug smuggling,\" U.S. Border Patrol Agent Chris Cabrera told Breitbart Texas in his capacity as president of National Border Patrol Council Local 3307 in\u00a0an interview on\u00a0October 26. \"When are we going to get back on the border?\"\n\nBob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

Pollsters predict the party will enter the German parliament for the first time this fall, seizing a double-digit share of the vote amid widespread dissatisfaction over Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s refugee policy.\n\nThey will be joined in Koblenz by Matteo Salvini, the leader of Italy\u2019s Northern League, and Dutch anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders, whose Party for Freedom is tipped to gain the largest percentage of votes in the Netherlands\u2019 March 15 parliamentary election. The party is shunned by its rivals, though, and unlikely to gain sufficient support for a coalition government.\n\nWhile Le Pen, Wilders and Salvini have met in the past, Petry\u2019s appearance has raised eyebrows in Germany.\n\nSenior members of AfD had previously dismissed the idea of working with Le Pen\u2019s National Front, and some still do.\n\nOfficially, the meeting is being organized by Petry\u2019s husband Marcus Pretzell, a European AfD lawmaker. Pretzell is part of the Europe of Nations and Freedom group in the European parliament, which is dominated by deputies from the National Front.\n\nAccording to the official program, Le Pen, Wilders and Salvini will speak in the morning, after which the event will be \u201ccrowned by Frauke Petry.\u201d\n\nEmmanuelle Reungoat, a political scientist at the University of Montpellier, France, said that although the parties have very different origins, a brief, media-friendly appearance would offer the participants an opportunity to present themselves as leaders with international stature.\n\n\u201cWhat interests them is to profit from the popularity each may have,\u201d Reungoat said.\n\nPetry\u2019s decision to share a platform with Le Pen may reflect the party\u2019s stated tactic of \u201ccarefully planned provocation\u201d that has served to keep AfD in the headlines for months, according to David Bebnowski, a political scientist at the University of Goettingen. Shortly after announcing the meeting, organizers banned a number of prominent German media outlets from attending, ensuring even greater attention for the event.\n\nBebnowski said that the embrace of Le Pen, Wilders and Salvini also shows AfD\u2019s continued shift to the right, a direction that doesn\u2019t seem to have harmed the party, even when some of its own members questioned the direction it was heading in.\n\nClaudia Martin, who was elected as an AfD member of the Baden-Wuerttemberg state assembly last year, said that she joined the party in 2013 because it offered an opportunity to become involved in politics that didn\u2019t seem possible in established parties.\n\nLast month, following a lengthy dispute over anti-Semitism in her regional party chapter, she quit AfD. \u201cThe party had an opportunity to draw a clear line and failed to do so,\u201d Martin told The Associated Press.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has become a \u201chero\u201d to some in the party who believe in overturning the old order, she said.\n\nHerfried Muenkler, a professor at Berlin\u2019s Humboldt university, said that the parties meeting on Saturday reflect a growing desire in their countries \u2014 also seen in the U.S. \u2014 to withdraw from politics at the global level and bring it back to the nation state.\n\n\u201cIf they were ever in a position to see those policies through, though, they will find themselves confronting each other,\u201d Muenkler said.\n\nLeft-wing groups have announced plans to protest the meeting, which will be held in a large congress center by the banks of the River Rhine.

Instead, Kerry insisted that securing peace with the Palestinians is a precondition for peace with the Arab world.\n\n\"There will be no separate peace between Israel and the Arab world. Let me make that clear to you,\" Kerry said. \"There will be no advance or separate peace in the Arab world without advancing the Palestinian issue. Everybody needs to understand that. That is a hard reality.\"\n\nHe also took Netanyahu to task for the prime minister's claim that the failure to recognize Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people is the essential\u00a0issue, saying that it is the settlements, and not Israel's identity as a Jewish state, that is to blame for the failure to make peace.\n\nSettlements, Kerry said, \"are not the cause of this conflict. But \u2026 if you have a whole bunch of people who are strategically locating outposts and settlements in an area so that there will not be a contiguous Palestinian state, they are doing it to be an obstacle to peace.\"\n\nHe further slammed Netanyahu's government as having a lack of leadership, citing Education Minister Naftali Bennett's recent comments that Israel had reached the \"end of the two-state solution\" as \"profoundly disturbing.\"\n\n\"I cannot accept the notion that [settlements] don't affect the peace process, that they aren't a barrier to the ability to create peace,\" Kerry contended. \"The left in Israel is telling everyone that it is a barrier to peace and the right, which supports it, is openly telling people that they support it because they don't want peace. They believe in Greater Israel.\"\n\nWhile Israeli politicians on the right have argued that settlement construction in the West Bank and east Jerusalem has almost entirely ceased under the Obama administration, Kerry claimed that the settler population had grown by 20,000 since Obama came into office, \"narrow[ing] the capacity for peace.\"\n\nThe secretary of state further noted that \"there has simultaneously been a process of demolition of Palestinian homes,\" saying that there are currently 11,000 standing demolition orders against Palestinian-constructed buildings in the West Bank.\n\nKerry also warned that the failure to advance the two-state solution would render Israel's status as a Jewish and democratic state unsustainable.\n\n\"So how does this work?\" Kerry asked. \"How do you have a one state that is Jewish and democratic and also has provisions in place for Israel's security?\"\n\n\"What's your vision of a unitary state?\" he continued. \"If Palestinians are a majority, will there be a Palestinian prime minister of Israel?", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.58899664878845, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 578, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.7725108176, "HarmVirtue": 17, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161205170000, "FairnessVice": 2, "pct_mft_words": 4.4982698961937695, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/news/militants-retake-ancient-city-of-palmyra-from-syrian-forces/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Militants retake ancient city of Palmyra from Syrian forces", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1133, "date": "20161212030000", "story_content": "BEIRUT (AP) \u2014 Islamic State militants recaptured the ancient city of Palmyra from Syrian troops Sunday, according to both sides in the battle, scoring a major advance after a year of setbacks in Syria and neighboring Iraq.\n\nIn winning back Palmyra, the extremist group appeared to be taking advantage of the Syrian and Russian preoccupation with Aleppo, timing its attack to coincide with a major government offensive to capture the last remaining opposition-held neighborhoods in the northern city.\n\nPalmyra, with its towering 2,000-year-old ruins, holds mostly symbolic meaning in the wider civil war, although its location in central Syria also gives it some strategic significance.\n\nIslamic State militants re-entered the city Saturday for the first time since they were expelled by Syrian and Russian forces amid much fanfare nine months ago. The government\u2019s first important win against the Islamic State group in the historic city gave Damascus the chance to try to position itself as part of the global anti-terrorism campaign.\n\nThe militants had spent 10 months in Palmyra, during which they blew up a number of temples and caused other destruction \u2014 severing the heads of statues and partially damaging two temples and famous arch.\n\nMaamoun Abdulkarim, Syria\u2019s official for antiquities and museums, said his department had transferred the contents of Palmyra\u2019s museum to Damascus, but that he still worries about the safety of the ruins from the IS militants.\n\n\u201cI fear they will be more vengeful,\u201d Abdulkarim told The Associated Press.\n\nPalmyra was a major tourist attraction before Syria\u2019s civil war began in 2011.\n\nSunday\u2019s takeover came hours after government troops and Russian air raids pushed the group out the city\u2019s perimeter.

By Sunday evening, there was no sign the army was shifting significant resources from Aleppo.\n\nThe government and its allies reportedly have mobilized some 40,000 fighters for Aleppo.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the regime would withdraw forces from Aleppo to Palmyra and risk losing Aleppo,\u201d said Rami Abdurrahman, the head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition monitoring group. \u201cI think the regime\u2019s priority now is to finish the battle for Aleppo before the end of the month for sure. As for Palmyra, the whole international community would stand by it against IS.\u201d\n\nIn the last year, IS has suffered defeats in both Syria and Iraq, losing several towns and cities it had captured in 2014.\n\nIt is now under attack in Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second-largest city and the last major urban center it controls in the country. Since the Mosul offensive began nearly two months ago, Iraqi and U.S.-led coalition forces have killed or gravely wounded more than 2,000 IS fighters, said Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the top U.S. commander in Iraq. He made his remarks at a news conference with U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter at Qayara air base in Iraq.\n\nOn Saturday, Carter announced he is sending another 200 troops to Syria to train and advise local fighters combatting IS. There are already 300 U.S. troops authorized for the Syria effort, and some 5,000 in Iraq.\n\nA Kurdish-led Syrian force, backed by the U.S., is also pushing toward Raqqa, the group\u2019s de-facto capital in Syria, from the north. Meanwhile, Turkey is backing Syrian opposition fighters who have reached the outskirts of al-Bab, the IS stronghold in northern Syria.\n\nIn going for Palmyra, IS picked a soft target to demonstrate that it retains the ability to carry out large attacks despite its battlefield losses.\n\nMohammed Hassan al-Homsi, who runs the Palmyra News Network, said IS was steering away from northern Syria, where Turkey and the anti-IS international coalition have focused their fight. The militants are eyeing new territory, and they chose Palmyra for its desert terrain linked to Iraq and its surrounding oil and gas fields, al-Homsi said.\n\nThe state news agency SANA, quoting an unidentified military official, reported that the militant group received reinforcements from Raqqa.\n\nRussia\u2019s Defense Ministry put some of the blame on the coalition, saying it had scaled down its operation against Raqqa and allowed thousands of IS fighters to escape Mosul. The ministry said more than 4,000 militants have been deployed for the Palmyra takeover, implying those attacking the city recently had left Mosul.\n\nThe Observatory and the Palmyra Coordination group said IS militants used a multipronged assault, forcing government forces to retreat south. A map distributed by the Observatory shows the IS-controlled areas extend east, south and north of Palmyra. They encompass a number of strategic hills around the city and expand the group\u2019s presence in rural parts of Homs province, Syria\u2019s largest, which is mostly under government control.\n\nOsama al-Khatib of the activist-run Palmyra Coordination group, which keeps in touch with residents, said remaining government and allied troops were escaping from the southwestern edge of the city, where the ancient ruins are. The few remaining families also are trying to leave, he said.\n\nAl-Homsi\u2019s Palmyra News Network said intense airstrikes followed the IS takeover. The group said IS fired on fleeing civilian.\n\nIn a video by the IS-linked Aamaq news agency, IS fighters were shown roaming a main square that appeared deserted below the citadel that overlooks the ruins and the Palmyra Museum.\n\nRussia had earlier said it repelled an IS attack, launching 64 airstrikes overnight that killed 300 militants. But hours later, the activists said IS had seized a castle just outside the town that overlooks its famed Roman-era ruins.\n\nExpelling the IS militants last year was seen as a major triumph for Assad\u2019s forces, which previously had little success against the extremists.\n\nThe government and its Russian allies have since focused on the opposition in Damascus and Aleppo. After tightening the siege on eastern Aleppo, government and allied troops have been steadily carving into the rebel-held enclave since late November.\n\nOf the original 45 square kilometers (17 square miles) of rebel-held area, only 7 square kilometers (4 square miles) remain in opposition hands, Syrian media said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Zeina Karam in Beirut, Howard Amos and Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow, Albert Aji in Damascus, Syria, and Robert Burns at Qayara air base in Iraq contributed to this report.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.927180290222171, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1090, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 28, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 8.090398349560001, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 5, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 28, "mft_sum": 55, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161212030000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.045871559633031, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 5.0}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/11/01/secretary-gates-wrong-hillary-clinton-already-sized-president-doesnt-look-good/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [631, 2035, 2322]}}, "headline": "Jerry Boykin \u2013 Secretary Gates Is Wrong: Hillary Clinton Has Already Been \"Sized Up\" as President\u2014And It Doesn't Look Good", "wordcount_as_scraped": 843, "date": "20161101220000", "story_content": "The FBI director's reopening of its investigation into Hillary Clinton's handling of classified emails once again puts a spotlight on her fitness to be commander-in-chief. Throughout this year national security experts have struggled to defend Hillary Clinton's record on the issue.\n\nJust last month, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, expressed hope that Mrs. Clinton would be able to repair the damage to her credibility and \"address forthrightly her trustworthiness.\"\u00a0 On the last Friday of October, his hopes were dashed.\n\nLet's examine the facts. Gates is right about one thing: Hillary Clinton has a major \"credibility problem.\" And it seems worse than Trump's. Which candidate has already had the opportunity to display credibility in foreign affairs, but has completely failed? Who has been the subject of multiple investigations for setting up a home-brew server, or lying to Congress and the American people about the events in Benghazi?\n\nThe answer is Hillary Clinton, who set up a home-brew server which kept her official email communications private. Clinton did this no doubt realizing it could jeopardize American interests, lives, and national security. And if she didn't realize this, then she's certainly unfit to be commander-in-chief.\n\nYet, despite all this, Secretary Gates inferred that Trump is unfit because, in his view, past presidents have surrounded themselves \"with independent-minded, knowledgeable and experienced advisers who would tell the president what he needed to hear, not what he wanted to hear. Sometimes presidents would take their advice, sometimes not. But they always listened.\" Fair enough. It does however, leave me wondering how much of Secretary Gates' advice was ignored by President Obama. In his book, Duty, Gates says that 2010 \"\u2026.was a year of continued conflict and a couple of important White House breeches of faith.\" \u00a0Mr. Gates explains that he was surprised by the announcement by the president of the implementation and timing of the repeal of the \"Don't ask, Don't tell\" policy for the military. Is this not something that the commander-in-chief should have consulted on with his Secretary of Defense?\u00a0 Maybe Secretary Gates should have resigned in protest if he really believes listening to advice is important. It doesn't sound as if Secretary Clinton really listened to any advice when she set up her own server against all US government regulations.\n\nMoreover, Clinton \u2014 not Trump \u2014 will be the commander-in-chief who would continue President Obama's destructive, weak, and absolutely failed philosophy for how to approach world conflicts and the struggles between good and evil that inform them. Indeed, it's the absence of a clear sense of good and evil which has caused President Obama to fail to grasp the struggle between radical Islam and true freedom. Mrs. Clinton was the architect of the Libyan policy that sent Americans into combat against what was a fairly benign dictator at the time, Moamar Gadhafi. All this was done with no consent or even notification of the US Congress. This is not a record that qualifies her for the position of commander-in-chief.\n\nThe more the evidence mounts that violent attacks across Europe and the United States (and indeed, the Middle East, Africa, and elsewhere) are driven by people who justify their killing sprees under Islamic theology, the more important it is to have a president who understands the nature of the enemy. Hillary has parroted the same rhetoric as Mr. Obama in denying what motivates Jihadists. Is that what we need in the next leader of our armed forces? Not if we take our national security seriously.\n\nMrs. Clinton personally lied to the nation and more importantly, to the families of the four people killed in Benghazi when she blamed an obscure video for prompting the attack. Committing the US military to combat is one of the most serious decisions any president will ever make. There is no reason to believe that Mrs. Clinton is someone that Americans should trust with the lives of their sons and daughters.\n\nDonald Trump isn't perfect. It is understandable for Secretary Gates to point out problems with both candidates. But his uniformly declaring Trump unfit (and Clinton fit) to be president does nothing to help America face the unavoidable challenges the next president will have to face. At least Trump understands the very basic fact\u2014a fact which has managed to escape President Obama (and those who think like him)\u2014that there exist violent people who are motivated by radical Islam (we can take their word for it), who want to do us harm, and who directly threaten the existence of our free society as we currently know it. We must not be ashamed in making this observation. Our survival depends on it.\n\nSecretary Gates is right about one thing: \"[w]e have to make a decision.\" Unlike him, however, I and many others believe the answer is quite the opposite.\n\nLt.

In a nation where 72 percent of citizens cannot afford three meals a day, the announcement that the little money they did have was useless sparked violence and looting that spread far beyond food. Groceries, hardware stores, universities, and private residences were all looted over the weekend\u00a0before Maduro announced that he would reinstate the 100-bol\u00edvar bill through January 2.\n\nAs The Wall Street Journal\u00a0reports, Chinese-owned businesses in Bol\u00edvar city became prime targets for looters over the weekend, in part due to the prevalence of Chinese groceries in the area.\u00a0\"They took the stands, the carts, all of the merchandise, which was a lot, and the air conditioners,\u201d China Cham supermarket owner\u00a0Juan Carlos Ho told the\u00a0Journal, noting that those he knows in Venezuela\u2019s Chinese community are thinking of repatriating because \u201cthere\u2019s nothing left and it\u2019s not worth investing again.\u201d Some locals, he adds, have accused the Chinese business owners of having a role in the abysmal economic situation Venezuela currently finds itself in, a claim witnesses speaking to Reuters echoed.\n\nAccording to the\u00a0Journal\u2018s tally, over 400 people were arrested for looting over the weekend, 300 in Bol\u00edvar alone. 350 stores registered disturbances in the region. Maduro blamed his American counterpart Barack Obama for the looting, claiming secret American agents were executing \u201cObama\u2019s final blow\u201d before leaving office. Socialist officials in the affected regions have argued similarly. \u201cHunger didn\u2019t motivate this,\u201d western T\u00e1chira governor Jos\u00e9 Vielma Mora said of the riots in his region. \u201cVandalism motivated this,\u201d blaming the anti-socialist opposition and noting the many shops looted for non-edible goods.\n\nChina has played an outsized role in helping socialist president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro stay in power. Just last week, Venezuela\u2019s Higher Education, Science, and Technology minister Jorge Arreaza announced that China would be handing the agency a sizable new investment. It would be the latest in tens of billions China has invested in Venezuela: $57 billion since 2007, according to\u00a0Forbes, which adds that Venezuela has been repaying these loans in oil, but that oil production under Maduro has slowed to a dangerous trickle. China has continued investing in the country, however, even offering goods like medicine, which Venezuelans are increasingly unable to acquire.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.6977491378784197, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 546, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.36666330712, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161221060000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.74725274725275, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/01/24/eubank-jesus-mosul/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [56, 77, 2049, 2054, 2066, 2073, 2080, 2091, 2103, 2112]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1720, "scraper_regex": 385}}, "headline": "Eubank: Jesus in Mosul", "wordcount_as_scraped": 385, "date": "20170124140000", "story_content": "David Eubank (far right, above) is\u00a0founder and director\u00a0of the Free Burma Rangers (FBR), a Christian humanitarian association that distributes relief in Burma (Myanmar), Syrian and Iraqi Kurdistan, and Sudan.

We brought ethnic people from Burma to help. In the midst of the continuing oppression and uncertainty in their country, Rangers from Burma felt the call to go help people under attack in Kurdistan, Syria, Iraq, Sudan and other places in the world.\n\nWe see the power of God in this and, as in Burma, we go compelled by His love to give help, hope and love in Jesus' name. In 2015 and 2016, we went to Kurdistan and Syria numerous times, providing medical training on the front lines, doing children's programs in the IDP camps and getting the news out. We stand against oppressors, be they in Burma, Kurdistan, Syria, Iraq or Sudan, and we are also praying for the oppressors\u2014and asking God for love for them. No one is beyond redemption: Fighting evil and grounding our actions in love are practical ways towards defeating evil and uniting for a new way forward.\n\n\n\nWhile we were working with the Kurds, and before we were invited to help bring food for people in Mosul, we were told, \"You Free Burma Rangers may be able to work in Kurdistan and pray with people there, but in Mosul its completely different. There is no place for Jesus stuff in Mosul because God is not there. It is a violent, extremest place, it is not your place.\"\n\nWe believe He led us to Mosul and our prayer is to be His ambassadors.

Myanmar officials are making the laughable claim that the Rohingyas are burning down their own homes to embarrass the government, but it\u2019s pretty widely believed that it\u2019s being done Myanmar soldiers and security forces.\n\nMyanmar officials are refusing to allow any aid agencies, international investigative agencies or reporters to enter the area to determine who is burning down the villages. However, eyewitness reports have been coming out, and John McKissick, head of the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) in the Bangladeshi border town of Cox\u2019s Bazar, says that Myanmar troops are \u201ckilling men, shooting them, slaughtering children, raping women, burning and looting houses, forcing these people to cross the river\u201d into Bangladesh. Other UN officials are saying that the Myanmar government actions are \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d\n\nThis is all completely believable in view of the history of the past few years. In 2012 and 2013, Buddhist monks in Burma have been leading genocidal attacks on Rohingyas, in violation of the precepts of the Buddhism religion. In one attack, large mobs with hundreds of Buddhists attacked Muslims with knives and sticks.\n\nThe attacks have been led by Buddhist monk Ashin Wirathu and his \u201c969 movement,\u201d where 969 is a historic Buddhist sign, referring to the nine qualities of Buddha, the six qualities of Buddha\u2019s teaching, and nine qualities of the Buddhist community. 969 is supposed to promote peace and happiness, although Wirathu\u2019s 969 movement is a vehicle promoting violence. And now the Burma\u2019s army is apparently taking over the movement with ethnic cleansing.\n\nFrom the point of view of Generational Dynamics, this is a classic, historical act of genocidal extermination of one group targeting another. In this generational Crisis era, we\u2019re going to see more of these \u2014 Hindu vs Muslim in Kashmir, Sunni vs Shia in the Mideast, reminiscent of Hutus vs Tutsis in 1994 Rwanda, Christian vs Jew in World War II or French vs English in the Hundred Years War, or Protestant vs Catholic in European wars of the past.

Bangladesh\u2019s foreign ministry has confirmed that thousands of Rohingya have already sought refuge in the country, while thousands more are reportedly gathering on the border.\n\nThose defending Bangladesh\u2019s policy point out that there are millions of Rohingyas living in Rakhine state, and if Bangladesh completely opened the border, then the surge of fleeing refugees would be overwhelming. VOA and BBC and Al Jazeera\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTens of thousands flee from northern Burma across border to China\n\nBurma has a completely separate problem with other ethnic groups in the north \u2013 the Kachin Independence Army, the Ta'ang National Liberation Army, and Kokang's Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army. As  I recently reported, these groups are continuing decades\u2019 long fights with Burma\u2019s army, and tens of thousands of residents from the region are fleeing across the border into China to escape the violence.\n\nChina has put its army on high alert along the border, and is reinforcing its troops on the border with military trucks, tanks, heavy weapons and machine guns. China says that it is willing to play a \u201cconstructive role\u201d in helping Myanmar resolve the problem, but no one knows whether that would mean that under some circumstances China\u2019s military would cross the border into Myanmar.\n\nFrom the point of view of Generational Dynamics, Burma is an extremely difficult country to analyze because there are so many different ethnic groups fighting with and against each other. Following World War II, Burma experienced a series of extremely bloody crisis civil wars that only climaxed in 1958 when the army took over power. There has been sporadic fighting among these groups in the decades since then, but nothing that has escalated into a major war. Of the 15 armed ethnic groups in Burma, only eight were willing to sign a peace agreement at a recent signing ceremony.\n\nA major research project is needed for Burma.

Groups like ISIS are radicalizing new operatives from within our borders, and just this week their new spokesman called for more inspired attacks by supporters 'all over the world,'\u201d said committee chairman Michael McCaul (R-TX).\n\n\u201cMake no mistake: we face a deadlier threat than ever before not only because our enemies have gotten savvier, but because we took the pressure off them. For eight years, the Obama Administration reluctantly played global whack-a-mole with terrorists rather than leaning into the fight with decisive leadership,\u201d McCaul charged.\n\n\u201cBecause of this, the Trump Administration will inherit a generational struggle that has only gotten longer. But rest assured, we will work closely with them to turn the table on these fanatics,\u201d he promised.\n\nMcCaul\u2019s remarks, and the Homeland Security Committee\u2019s report, stand in stark contrast to President Obama\u2019s triumphalist speech at MacDill Air Force Base on Tuesday, in which he congratulated himself for running a nearly flawless war on terrorism for the past eight years. He boasted, \u201cNo foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned an executed an attack on our homeland.\u201d In other words, all the \u201clone wolves\u201d don\u2019t count.\n\nTo put it mildly, the House report sees things very differently, beginning with the assertion that ISIS lone wolf attacks\u00a0do\u00a0count, especially to the people killed and injured by them. Also, while President Obama cited the number of terrorist operations detected and thwarted by law enforcement as a comforting sign the system is working, House Homeland Security sees it as a troubling indication that the tempo of terrorism is increasing.\n\nThe report says:\n\nThe United States faces its highest Islamist terror threat environment since 9/11, and much of the threat now stems from individuals who have been radicalized at home. Since 9/11, the nation has seen 227 homegrown jihadist cases with a recent surge of 115 cases in 2015 and 2016 alone. ISIS' shift in messaging \u2014\u00a0from joining the jihad in Syria and Iraq to carrying out attacks in fighters' home countries \u2014 is likely to accelerate this trend.\nISIS continued to wreak havoc against Western targets in 2016. Throughout the year, ISIS conducted 62 attacks, wounding 732 and killing 215 in places like the United States, France, and Belgium. The threat to Europe and the United States will persist in 2017, particularly as jihadists flee from Mosul and Raqqa. Terror groups will also continue to rely on refugee programs, porous borders, and well-known migration routes to gain access to various countries throughout the West.\n\nThe report also asserts that the Iran nuclear deal, along with instability in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, has \u201creenergized Tehran\u2019s hardliners and placed the regime in a stronger position to achieve regional hegemony.\u201d\n\n\u201cIranian aggression, particularly in the Persian Gulf, has become routine and remains largely unopposed. If left unchecked, Tehran will continue to threaten United States' interests at home and abroad,\u201d the report warns.\n\nAnother sharp difference with President Obama\u2019s outlook is on the matter of Guant\u00e1namo Bay. In his final major foreign policy speech, Obama described closing Gitmo as a moral imperative, derided opponents as prisoners of the \u201cpolitics of fear,\u201d and boasted about how many detainees have been transferred to the custody of foreign governments.\n\nHouse Homeland Security notes that the President forgot to mention \u201cat least 30 percent of all former Guantanamo Bay prisoners are known or suspected to have returned to terrorism following their release.\u201d\n\nThe report quotes information from the National Counterterrorism Center about \u201cindividuals with ties to terrorist groups in Syria attempting to gain entry to the U.S. through the U.S. refugee program.\u201d The dangers of Somali refugees are highlighted with Abdul Razak Ali Artan\u2019s car-and-knife jihad attack on the Ohio State University Campus. Other prominent terrorism cases involving refugees include the November 2015 massacre in Paris\u00a0and the March 2016 attack on Brussels.\n\nWhile the report agrees with President Obama\u2019s assessment that ISIS has lost considerable territory and influence in Syria, Iraq, and Libya, a great deal of ISIS activity from affiliates around the world is logged, along with plenty of dangerous moves from al-Qaeda, which most certainly did not go out of business with the death of Osama bin Laden.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -9.04458618164062, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 709, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 14, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 5.7897030284, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 14, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 14, "mft_sum": 50, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161208030000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 7.05218617771509, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 4.54545454545}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/01/17/pope-francis-inaugurates-first-palestinian-embassy-holy-see/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3646, 3647], "\u00ec": [1188]}}, "headline": "Pope Francis Inaugurates First Palestinian Embassy to the Holy See", "wordcount_as_scraped": 598, "date": "20170117190000", "story_content": "This weekend Pope Francis received Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the Vatican and formally inaugurated the new Embassy of the State of Palestine to the Holy See.\n\nAbbas met with the pontiff at the Vatican for some 20 minutes on Saturday just before the opening of diplomatic offices on Via di Porta Angelica, just outside the Vatican City, in a building that also houses the embassies of Peru, Ecuador and Burkina Faso.\n\nThe new Palestinian embassy, said Abbas, \"is a sign that the Pope loves the Palestinian people and peace.\" The Vatican recognized the state of Palestine about a year and a half ago.\n\nAfter the meeting, Abbas also said that he hopes \"other states will follow the Holy See's example.\"\n\n\"We are proud to be the birthplace of Christianity and about having one of the oldest Christian communities in the world,\" he said.\n\nDuring the meeting, Abbas offered the Pope several gifts, including a stone from Mount Golgotha. Reciprocating, Francis gave the Palestinian President a jubilee year medal as well as an Arabic version of his two teaching letters Amoris Laetitia (the Joy of Love) and Laudato S\u00ec, on the care of the environment.\n\nThe Holy See began referring to Palestine as a \"state\" as of November 2012, when the United Nations voted to recognize it as a nonmember observer state, but only formally recognized Palestinian statehood in a legal document in May of 2015.\n\nOn Sunday, Abbas traveled to Paris to participate in an international conference that aims to promote the resumption of peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel did not participate in the conference.\n\nAbbas took advantage of the meeting to express his opposition to the plan of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump to transfer the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\n\"Any attempts at legitimizing the illegal Israeli annexation of the city will destroy the prospects of any political process, bury the hopes for a two-state solution, and fuel extremism in our region, as well as worldwide,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe status of the city is one of the most crucial and complex issues of debate underlying the peace process in the Middle East.

Trump\u2019s campaign actively engaged the Cuban refugee population of South Florida \u2013 as well as the more recent arrivals from Cuban puppet state Venezuela \u2013 gaining an historic endorsement from the Brigada 2506: the freedom fighters to executed the military siege of Bay of Pigs.\n\nSpeaking to the group at Miami\u2019s Bay of Pigs museum, Trump made the Ladies in White \u2013 a peaceful anti-communist dissident group of women that routinely suffers beatings, torture, and arbitrary arrest under the Castro regime \u2013 an issue in a U.S. campaign otherwise focused on domestic issues like trade.\n\nTrump\u2019s approach to the Cuban regime stands in stark contrast to the moves President Barack Obama made in office to embolden the Castros. Following his 2014 announcement that Washington would seek \u201cnormalization\u201d with the Castros, the President made a personal visit to Havana, where he did \u201cthe wave\u201d with Ra\u00fal Castro and posed for photos in front of the likeness of mass murderer Ernesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara.\n\nFor his trouble, the Cuban press referred to President Obama as a \u201cnegro\u2026 inciting rebellion and disorder\u201d and Cuban officials referred to his visit as an \u201cattack.\u201d\n\nDemocratic nominee Hillary Clinton supported President Obama\u2019s engagement of the Castro regime, and served as First Lady during a presidency especially marred by Cuban human rights violations and egregious government acts against Cuban refugees. Under President Bill Clinton, the Cuban government killed four humanitarian workers belonging to the Brothers to the Rescue group, including U.S. citizens. Clinton asserted he was \u201cconcerned\u201d but did nothing to ensure Cuba did not lash out again.\n\nThe United States also did nothing to condemn the Clinton-era massacre of 37 Cuban refugees, including women and children, the Cuban government drowned on the March 13 tugboat.\n\nIn 2000, the Clinton administration stormed the home of Cuban refugees, abducting six-year-old Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez at gunpoint and returning him to a nation his mother died trying to get him out of.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 15, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.91549301147461, "HarmVice": 6, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 671, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.17390555755, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161109180000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 4.6199701937406905, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/01/04/time-top-risks-world/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1136, 2389, 4601, 5059, 5514]}}, "headline": "HAYWARD: Time's 'Top 10 Risks to the World in 2017' Starts with America, Excludes Terrorism", "wordcount_as_scraped": 915, "date": "20170105020000", "story_content": "Ian Bremmer of Time magazine declared a \"geopolitical recession\" due to the election of Donald Trump, and put forth his list of \"Top 10 Risks to the World in 2017\" with this howler of an opening paragraph:\n\nThe triumph of an \"America first\" foreign policy marks a fundamental break with decades of U.S. exceptionalism and a consensus view in Washington that U.S. international leadership, however flawed and uneven, is indispensable for international stability.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nI hate to be the one to break it to him, but \"U.S. exceptionalism\" and \"U.S. international leadership\" were traded for a bag of multicultural magic beans by outgoing President Barack Obama, long before anyone thought Trump might run for President. \n\nThe Libya disaster, the Syria disaster, the Iran disaster, the ISIS disaster\u2026 on and on it goes, in every case reducing America's international credibility, with such remorseless consistency because Obama intended to sunset American leadership, regardless of the huge cost to Americans and people overseas.\u00a0\n\nRemember \"leading from behind?\" Never mind Obama's hidden agendas and deep-seated, faculty-lounge antipathy to American power, his stated purpose was to make the U.S. less exceptional, to concede its moral stature, and transfer leadership responsibilities to other nations.\n\nAs for \"international stability,\" how is that looking after unlovely but basically pro-American dictatorships were swapped out for Mad Max-style Muslim militias in the \"Arab Spring\"? \n\nLibya was transformed into a warlords-vs.-terrorists cage match, Europe is bucking under a tidal wave of contemptuous \"refugees,\" the Syrian bloodbath transformed Russia and Iran into the new Middle Eastern power axis, China began militarizing the South China Sea, and Russia snatched Crimea and tormented Ukraine? \n\nIt would be facile to say there's nowhere to go but up, but President-elect Trump has a fairly low bar to clear when it comes to handling American prestige and global stability better than his predecessor.\n\nThe notion that an \"America first\" stance will automatically make the world less stable is wrongheaded. Nations that look out for their own predictable interests are more predictable than the eight-year globalist dorm-room bull session held by Obama and his friends \u00a0Ask the Syrian resistance or the Israelis about that.\n\nNumber One on Bremmer's Top 10 list of threats facing the world is an \"Unpredictable America\":\n\nThe world's sole superpower was once the international trump card, imposing order to force compromise and head off conflict. Now it's a wildcard, because instead of creating policies designed to bolster global stability, President Trump will use U.S. power overwhelmingly to advance U.S. interests, with little concern for the broader impact. Trump is no isolationist. He's a unilateralist. Expect a more hawkish\u2013and a much less predictable\u2013U.S. foreign policy. Allies, especially in Europe and Asia, will hedge. Rivals like China and even Russia will test. U.S.-led institutions will lose more of their international clout.\n\nFor good measure, Number Two on the list of global security risks is\u2026 America again, because Bremmer worries about China \"overreacting\" to Trump's provocations. He worries that 2017 will be a \"dangerous year for China, and all who depend on it for growth and stability.\"\n\nNot only is the assertion that more \"unilateral\" foreign policy is less predictable dubious, but \"hawkish\" doesn't seem like the right word for Trump's foreign policy outlook, just as \"dovish\" would be an absurd adjective for President Barack \"Drone Strike\" Obama's legacy of wars burning around the world.\n\nThe Libyan intervention was \"unilateralist\" with respect to Obama's disregard for Congress, but impeccably \"multilateral\" in the way foreign leaders and Hillary Clinton badgered Obama into starting the war, and predictably disastrous. \n\nObama's \"red line\" in Syria was supposed to be the multilateral consensus of the international community \u2013 in one of his more scurrilous attempts to escape responsibility for his words, he claimed \"The World\" had drawn the red line against chemical weapons, not him. Gas-spewing dictator Bashar Assad correctly deduced that a red line drawn by \"everyone\" would be enforced by no one. The ban against using WMD was supposed to be the most predictable, universal principle on Earth, but it proved extremely unpredictable in practice, judging from the surprised expressions on the faces of the gas victims.\n\nAmerica tops\u00a0the Time hit parade of global threats\u2026 but ISIS, al-Qaeda, and the rest of the terrorist carnival of horrors are not on the list at all. The word \"Islamist\" is nowhere mentioned, in any of its permutations. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, an Islamist, makes it in at Number Eight because his \"tightening grip\" on power will \"exacerbate the country's economic problems and his worsening relations with Europe and his neighbors,\" but his ideology goes\u00a0unmentioned. The great danger for the Middle East listed in the article is disruptive technological change.\n\nEntry Number Three on the list is a potential \"power vacuum in Europe,\" which mentions the French elections, Brexit, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel's precarious position, but does not mention why all those European voters are so upset. The risk to global stability and national security that should be ranked high on this list is migration:\u00a0that is, mass immigration contrary to the best interests of citizens in the host countries. \n\nThe arrogance of denouncing the Trump administration and America as the top \"risks to the world in 2017\" without even mentioning terrorism, just a few days after the latest mass-murder atrocity, is breathtaking. \n\nPeople from 14 different countries were murdered at the Reina nightclub in Istanbul by a soldier of ISIS.

Much of the Arab world has been waiting for Abbas to retire or die, so that a younger leader like Dahlan could replace him.\n\nAbbas, born in 1935, is part of the old generation of survivors of the genocidal war between Jews and Arabs that followed the 1947 partitioning of Palestine and the creation of the state of Israel. When Yasser Arafat died in December 2004, Abbas was a natural choice to succeed him, because they were both war survivors and shared a common world view. But now the time is approaching for a successor and for a generational change.\n\nThe major aspirant is 55-year-old Mohammed Dahlan. Dahlan grew up poor in a Gaza refugee camp, but as a top aide to Arafat became Gaza\u2019s strongman in the 1990s, jailing leaders of rival Hamas which was trying to derail Arafat's negotiation with Israel through bombing and shooting attacks. Abbas and Dahlan used to be allies, but the 2008 war between Fatah and Hamas, that made Hamas the governing power in Gaza caused tension between them, until 2011 when Abbas expelled Dahlan completely from Fatah.\n\nThe population of the West Bank is badly split between supporters of Abbas and Dahlan. Abbas, as a survivor of the bloody 1947-48 war, has devoted much of his life to achieving some kind of political solution to the conflict with Israel \u2013\u00a0namely the so-called \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d with Israel and Palestine existing side by side in peace \u2013\u00a0a \u201csolution\u201d that can only be described as delusional.\n\nSupporters of Dahlan are generally much more belligerent, and are ready to go to war with Israel. Dahlan and his supporters are in the generations that grew up after the 1947-48, and have no personal memory of its horrors, and so is not afraid to see that war repeated.\n\nThe youngest generations of Palestinians, as far as I can tell, are pretty much disgusted with all the Palestinian leadership. This is the so-called \u201cOslo generation,\u201d kids growing up after the 1993 Oslo accords that were supposed to bring peace to the Mideast, but in fact are perceived as having accomplished nothing. They see the so-called \u201cMideast peace process\u201d as nothing more than a failed series of humiliations for Palestinians.\n\nThere has apparently been one change in the last year. In 2015, there was a spate of knife attacks on Israelis by 15-25 year old boys in the Oslo generation of Palestinians. Those knife attacks have not been in the news in a long time, and so apparently have run their course.

The most recent attempt followed the 31-day Gaza war between Israel and Hamas, which Israel won. After the war, there was enormous pressure from Arab states for Hamas and Fatah to unify into a single government. The United Nations General Assembly had created the nation \u201cPalestine\u201d in 2012, but it didn\u2019t make sense to have a state of Palestine, if the Palestinians had two separate governments in conflict with each other.\n\nThey did form a unity government in June 2014, but it was unity in name only. They never did function as a single government, and Abbas dissolved it in June 2015 over a disagreement about money.\n\nHowever, hopes have arisen again of a unity government, after Hamas chief Khaled Mashaal said in a speech earlier this month that a reconciliation should be tried:\n\nIt is time we reconsider the organization [Fatah/PA]. \u2026 In order to build our lives and political system on democratic foundations, we must be partners in shouldering responsibility and partners in the decision of war and peace\u2026\nThe wager on the diplomatic movement on its own has been proven a failure. Let us agree on a national strategy and that everyone is with the [armed] resistance, which is a legitimate right that raises the cost of the occupation.\n\nThe last sentence affirms that Hamas expects to continuing using violence against Israel, to end Israel\u2019s \u201coccupation\u201d of land in the Mideast and Israel\u2019s existence.\n\nThere\u2019s good reason to doubt that the West Bank and Gaza Palestinian populations can ever be unified into a single government. The two Palestinian territories have been separated for several decades, and so the two cultures have grown in separate directions.

Trump be elected as the next President of the United States, an event which he described as \"Brexit-plus-plus-plus\".\n\nAddressing an audience at the Hay-Adams hotel in Washington D.C. on the eve of Mr. Trump's inauguration as the 45th President of the United States of America, Mr. Farage said the presidential campaign had been one of highs and lows \u2013 but that the outcome had been worth it.\n\n\"At times it wasn't necessarily that easy to be helping the Trump campaign,\" he admitted.\n\n\"There were one or two low moments. But I think what's exciting is that 2016 will be looked at in ten years' time, in a hundred years' time, as a year of a great pivot, of a great change.\n\n\"A year when nation state democracy reasserted itself. A year when proper decent values reasserted themselves.

He believes it represents a sea-change in the social zeitgeist.\n\n\"I really believe this. Through most of my life, what happens in America in terms of social trends or developments, we follow, four or five years later. America is the leader. Now I would like to think, in my own little way, that what we did with Brexit was the beginning of what is going to turn out to be a global revolution, and that Trump's victory is a part of that.\"\n\nWhile Brexit was \"great\", Mr. Farage said, \"Trump becoming the President of the U.S.A. is Brexit-plus-plus-plus.\"\n\nLauding Trump, the man, as a worthy leader of the revolution movement, Farage added: \"He was right when he called it a movement, but a movement can't exist, a movement can't flourish without a leader.\n\n\"Trump is the only person I've ever met in my life who makes me feel like an introvert. He is a larger than life personality. When he was given the rule book to run for president he tore it up, he threw it out of the window.\n\n\"The most powerful man in the world will be the most extraordinary force of nature. Somebody and something that America and global politics have never seen before. Someone who may occasionally have a rough edge, but whose instincts are absolutely right \u2013 and whose feeling with fellow Americans, ordinary people, out there doing their best is I think the closest this country has seen since Ronald Reagan.\n\n\"I believe he's going to make a very good president, and I'm proud to have played my part, not just in Brexit, but in helping this man become the 45th President of the United States of America.\"\n\nTaking a moment to enjoy the occasion, Farage admitted: \"When I look back in years to come, perhaps the greatest joy of 2016 was that realisation, as state after state in the Midwest went red\u2026 Just to see the faces of those CNN presenters will stay with me forever.\"\n\nIt was an admission of a warm glow of victory that Farage urged others to share.\n\n\"The funny thing in life is that we all fight battles in our lives and we all have victories, and we all have failures. The odd thing is, that after our victories, normally there isn't really time to celebrate because we're moving on to the next battle.\n\n\u201cWhat we've got [on inauguration day] is actually a chance to reflect; a chance to celebrate those amazing victories of 2016,\u201d he said, as the audience applauded.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 4.23600625991821, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 593, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 6, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.45959077427, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 18, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170120180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.035413153457, "mft_mean": 1.63636363636}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/11/01/hundreds-islamic-state-child-soldiers-die-mosul-operation/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [99, 171, 1752, 2494, 2706, 2741, 2848]}}, "headline": "Hundreds of Islamic State \u2018Caliphate Cub\u2019 Child Soldiers Killed in Mosul Operation", "wordcount_as_scraped": 569, "date": "20161102190000", "story_content": "A report from the\u00a0Syrian Observatory for Human Rights NGO estimated that up to 300 Syrian\u00a0child soldiers have died fighting for the Islamic State since the beginning of the operation to liberate Mosul, Iraq, from the control of the terrorist group.\n\nThe Kurdish outlet Rudaw quotes the estimate from the UK-based rights group, noting that confirming these deaths is extremely difficult. The Islamic State routinely abducts young boys to enlist in its \u201cCaliphate Cub\u201d training program, where children learn how to shoot, torture, and behead infidels. The Rudaw report notes that 40 Islamic State jihadis\u2019 bodies have been confirmed to have returned to Raqqa, Syria, from Mosul. Raqqa is considered the capital of the terrorist group\u2019s \u201ccaliphate,\u201d while Mosul is its regional capital in Iraq. Mosul is the second-largest city in Iraq after Baghdad and has been under Islamic State control for two years.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory estimates that at least 480 Islamic State jihadists total have been killed since Baghdad announced the operation to retake Mosul two weeks ago. The Iraqi military is currently within Mosul city limits, while the Kurdish Peshmerga and Shiite Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) militias are surrounding the city to prevent jihadists from fleeing.\n\nThe Caliphate Cubs program is almost as old as the Islamic State declaration of a \u201ccaliphate\u201d itself. In 2014, ISIS began releasing its first propaganda videos featuring the children, many as young as 10, seen learning how to punch, kick, shoot, and use a variety of weapons. In some videos, younger children are depicted beheading dolls, while the older children behead \u201cinfidels,\u201d receiving candy\u00a0as their reward for a murder well done.\n\nIn 2015, the Islamic State announced the opening of the Farouk Institute for Cubs in Syria, meant to indoctrinate children with the Quran as well as teach them how to kill.\n\nSoon after the videos of the child soldiers began growing in popularity among Islamic State supporters, reports of ISIS jihadists abducting children by the hundreds to brainwash them and teach them how to kill grew common.\n\n\u201cCaliphate Cubs\u201d are prominent in the most recent Islamic State video publication, released last week. The release followed reports that the Islamic State is increasingly abducting civilians in and around Mosul and keeping them in locations far from the fighting to use as human shields at a later date\u00a0when U.S. aircraft will be more likely to engage in airstrikes to aid the coalition on the ground.\n\nThe Iraqi military has insisted that the fight to retake Mosul is going well. In an update on Iraqi television,\u00a0General Talib Shegati said Monday,\u00a0\"The soldiers of the Counterterrorism Force are advancing very fast. I wouldn't say a matter of days but a\u00a0matter of hours before advancing and start cleansing the city of Mosul from terrorism.\u201d\n\nWith the Mosul operation moving at a brisk pace, many have begun expressing concerns regarding the fate of the city once the operation is over. Both the Turkish and U.S. governments have expressed concern that Shiite militias operating in the south and west of the city may overrun Sunni neighborhoods and commit acts of ethnic cleansing. Christian groups, meanwhile, fearing they are ill-represented among the various factions fighting for Mosul, announced Tuesday that their independent militias have agreed to unite to protect the Nineveh Plain region and, ultimately, a liberated Mosul.\n\nBefore its capture, Mosul was one of Iraq\u2019s major Christian population centers.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.3167495727539102, "HarmVice": 8, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 554, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.3914448069, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161102190000, "PurityVirtue": 2, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.15162454873646, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/01/04/dnc-war-room-against-trump-armed-with-former-clinton-staffers/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [602, 698, 1021, 1344, 1441, 1722, 2727, 2760, 3086, 3278, 3516, 3544, 3608]}}, "headline": "DNC \u2018War Room\u2019 Against Trump Armed with Former Clinton Staffers", "wordcount_as_scraped": 555, "date": "20170105050000", "story_content": "The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is reportedly adding several of Hillary Clinton\u2019s former campaign staffers to their planned political \u201cwar room\u201d against President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nAccording to the Hill, that list includes interim communications director John Neffinger, a veteran Democratic strategist; Clinton\u2019s former rapid response director, Zac Petkanas, who will act as senior adviser to the DNC and run the war room; former Clinton campaign spokeswoman Adrienne Watson, who will be the DNC\u2019s national press secretary; and\u00a0Tessa Simonds who was appointed as the digital director for the war room on Tuesday.\n\nThe DNC\u2019s\u00a0interim Chairwoman Donna Brazile \u2014 who has been riddled with controversy \u2014 says the focus of the new staff will be to \u201csupport an independent and bipartisan congressional investigation of Russia\u2019s unprecedented interference in the 2016 election,\u201d which they blame for Clinton\u2019s loss.

Keith Ellison (D-MN) \u2014 are in a fight against more centrist Democrats who are reportedly supporting President Barack Obama\u2019s Labor secretary, Tom Perez.\n\nEllison,\u00a0a progressive Democrat and the first Muslim elected to Congress, announced his candidacy in November.\n\nThe former Nation of Islam member and alleged anti-Semite, has faced a slew of criticism\u00a0\u2014 including from the Anti-Defamation League \u2014 after audio surfaced from 2010 in which the left-wing congressman said that Israel controlled the U.S. government.\n\nDuring a December appearance on MSNBC, Former Vermont Gov.

The arrests, in a handful of cases, have come while defendants were at court on criminal matters unrelated to their immigration status, said Melissa Rothstein, the office's director of policy and development.\nRothstein also noted that the public defender's office received a recent report that after 150 to 200 people showed up at an ICE office in Baltimore in response to letters that called them in for an \"interview,\" some were taken into ICE custody.

After meeting with the students, Shanley sent a letter to all faculty, staff, and both undergraduate and graduate students. The letter reads in part:\n\nAfter dialoging with the students, I believe it is imperative for me to respond to their concerns.\nUniversities are places where ideas are supposed to be brought into conflict and questioned, so let us robustly debate the meaning of \"diversity.\" But we must also remember that words have an impact on those who hear or read them. When a professor questions the value of diversity, the impact on many students, faculty, and staff of color is to feel that their presence is not valued and that they are not welcome at Providence College. I have heard from many students about the pain that this causes. When student activists are described as \"narcissists,\" they understandably feel demeaned and dismissed. We need to be able to disagree with each other's ideas without attaching labels to them or imputing motives that we cannot know.\nOur Catholic mission at Providence College calls us to embrace people from diverse backgrounds and cultures as a mirror of the universal Church and to seek the unity of that Body in the universal love of Christ. Pope Francis has likened this communion to the weaving of a blanket, \"woven with patience and perseverance, one which gradually draws together stitches to make a more extensive and rich cover.\" He reminds us as well that what we seek is not \"unanimity, but true unity in the richness of diversity.\" Finally, Francis reminds us that \"plurality of thought and individuality reflect the manifold wisdom of God when we draw nearer to truth with intellectual honesty and rigor, when we draw near to goodness, when we draw near to beauty, in such a way that everyone can be a gift for the benefit of others.\" Amen.\n\nWriting also at Crisis, American Principles Project education director Emmett McGroarty and senior fellow Jane Robbins observed:\n\nSadly, Fr. Shanley followed the template of invertebrate college administrators everywhere: He weakly defended Esolen's academic freedom but\u2014and there's always a \"but\"\u2014rebuked him for causing \"pain\" to the protesting students. Shanley then suggested that Esolen's truth-telling had violated \"our fundamental imperative on a Catholic campus: to be charitable to one another.\u201d\n\nOn its website, Providence College answers the question what it means to be \"Catholic\":\n\nOn the one hand, it means that one is a member of the Catholic Church, believes what the Church teaches, and does what Catholics do. On the other hand, to be catholic \u2014 and here the lowercase is intentional \u2014 is to be open, tolerant, and universal in one\u2019s interests and sympathies. Both definitions are right and both apply to Providence College. But the most radical sense of being Catholic is to view the created world as a sacrament of the divine, that is, as something that both points to and makes present God\u2019s saving grace.\n\nEsolen told Dreher that, after being singled out by Shanley, the school's president met with faculty where the scholar was reviled further, with several of Esolen's colleagues defending his right to express his views.\n\n\"When the president said that he believed that he had to act 'for pastoral reasons,' they replied that it was a strange form of pastoral care that pits every member of a community against one,\" Esolen said, adding that a petition or \"resolution\" was then circulated among faculty, stating that academic freedom must be \"exercised responsibly.\" The resolution, he said, denounced \"racist, xenophobic, sexist, homophobic, and religiously chauvinistic\" articles such as his.\n\nEsolen's essay on diversity \"rests on a central teaching of Christianity: 'God created man in his own image, in the image of God he create him, male and female he created them' (Gen. 1:27),\" note McGroarty and Robbins, adding:\n\nEsolen's offense seems to lie in his taking this teaching seriously.\u00a0As his essay makes clear, he sees an individual first and foremost not as a member of a group, but as a human person created in the image of God. Esolen also notes the paradox that the campus diversity movement results in enforced sameness, not the true diversity of the Church\u2014\"a political movement which is, for all its talk, a push for homogeneity, so that all the world will look not like the many-cultured Church, but rather like the monotone non-culture of western cities that have lost their faith in the transcendent and unifying God.\"\n\nEsolen himself has a message for Christian parents sending their children off to college:\n\nChristian parents \u2014 please do not suppose that your child will retain his or her faith after four years of battering at a secular college. Oh, many do \u2014 and many colleges have Christian groups that are terrific. But understand that it is going to be a dark time; and that everything on campus will be inimical to the faith, from the blockheaded assumptions of their professors, to the hook-ups, to the ignorance of their fellow students and their unconscious but massive bigotry. Be advised.\n\nEsolen was also one of some 130 Catholic scholars who signed onto a letter to the United States Catholic bishops in 2013, urging them to abandon any implementation of the Common Core standards in their dioceses.\n\n\"Common Core shortchanges the central goals of all\u00a0sound education and surely those of Catholic education: to grow in the virtues necessary\u00a0to know, love, and serve the Lord, to mature into a responsible, flourishing adult, and to\u00a0contribute as a citizen to the process of responsible democratic self-government,\" that letter read.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.1790714263916, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 1, "wordcount": 1222, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.64418901314, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 34, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 5, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161204180000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.7823240589197997, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.0909090909099994}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/12/12/pentagon-announces-deployment-200-troops-syria-aleppo-collapses/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1538, 2061, 4038]}}, "headline": "Pentagon to Deploy 200 Troops to Syria as Aleppo Falls to Russia, Iran, Syria", "wordcount_as_scraped": 790, "date": "20161213050000", "story_content": "The Pentagon announced this weekend that President Barack Obama has approved the deployment of 200 additional U.S. troops to Syria amid reports that the embattled city of Aleppo had nearly fallen to Russia and Iran-backed forces loyal to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.\n\nBy Monday, the fight for the northern Syrian city of Aleppo, the capital of a province of the same name, \u201chas reached its end\u201d with the retreat of anti-Assad rebels from the opposition-controlled eastern part of the city, declared Rami Abdulrahman, director of the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), on Monday.\n\nThe Observatory uses a network of sources on the ground to monitor the Syrian conflict.\n\nBesides the Assad regime claiming early Monday that it had captured 98 percent of Aleppo, the Russian- and Iran-backed Syrian government has not commented on the Observatory's report that the fight for the city is over, notes Sky News.\n\nAleppo city had been roughly divided between Assad regime control in the west and rebel control in the east since 2012.\n\n\"Families got together waiting death together.

American troops in Syria to 500 by deploying 200 more.\n\nThe primary purpose of the additional troops is to assist tens of thousands of Kurdish and Arab fighters preparing for an offensive to retake Raqqa, the Islamic State's de-facto capital in Syria, in an\u00a0effort to deal the terrorist group \u201ca lasting defeat,\u201d revealed Carter.\n\nSpeaking at the Manama Dialogue in Bahrain, which is organized by the British think tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), the Pentagon chief said on Saturday:\n\nTo ensure the success of isolating Raqqa, generate sufficient local forces to seize Raqqa, and deny ISIL sanctuary beyond Raqqa, I can tell you today that the United States will deploy approximately 200 additional U.S. forces to Syria, including special operations forces trainers, advisors, and explosive ordnance disposal teams.\nThese uniquely skilled operators will join the 300 U.S. special operations forces already in Syria, to continue organizing, training, equipping, and otherwise enabling capable, motivated, local forces to take the fight to ISIL, and are also bringing down the full weight of U.S. forces around the theater of operations like the funnel of a giant tornado.\n\nCarter made the announcement a few days after the Russia-Iran-Syria coalition claimed that it had taken over nearly 93 percent of Aleppo.\n\nEarly on Monday, the Assad regime reportedly claimed it had seized 98 percent of the provincial capital city.\n\nSOHR Director Abdulrahman ultimately said rebels have withdrawn from the last six neighborhoods they controlled in eastern Aleppo, notes Sky News.\n\n\"As day broke, the Russians, Syrians and the Observatory claimed ever diminishing amounts of territory were under the control of rebels who had held the territory for over four years,\" it also reports.\n\nNear the end the day Sunday, a spokesman for Syrian opposition fighters quoted by Sky News conceded that they were retreating, describing the collapse of rebel-held Aleppo as \"terrifying.\"\n\n\u201cIf Assad and his allies think that a military advance in certain quarters of Aleppo will signify that we will make concessions, then [I

have fled eastern Aleppo in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number who have escaped the carnage to nearly 130,000.\n\nIn Syria, President Obama's threats against the Assad regime have proven to

after raising key rate: 3 more hikes in 2017", "wordcount_as_scraped": 912, "date": "20161215060000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 After raising its benchmark interest rate in response to a strengthening U.S. economy, the Federal Reserve foresees three more hikes in 2017.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s move to raise its key rate will mean modestly higher rates on some loans.\n\nWednesday\u2019s action signaled the Fed\u2019s belief that the economy has improved over the past year after a rough start to 2016 and can withstand slightly higher borrowing rates. Its expectation of three rate increases in 2017 is up from two in its forecast three months ago.\n\nThe central bank said in a statement after its latest policy meeting that it\u2019s raising its benchmark rate by a quarter-point to a still-low range of 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent. The Fed had most recently raised the rate last December from a record low near zero set during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nResponding to a question at a news conference, Chair Janet Yellen said she didn\u2019t think the economy needed stimulus from President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s proposed tax cuts and infrastructure spending \u2014 the kind of fiscal support that Yellen and her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, had called for in the past.\n\nYellen said such policies would be unlikely to maximize employment, since the unemployment rate \u2014 4.6 percent, a nine-year low \u2014 is now slightly below the Fed\u2019s own long-term target.\n\n\u201cMy predecessor and I called for fiscal stimulus when the unemployment rate was substantially higher than it is now,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Fed chair stressed that she wasn\u2019t providing advice or guidance to the incoming Trump administration. And she downplayed any expectations that Trump\u2019s economic program could lead to faster rate hikes resulting from higher inflation.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s move Wednesday, only the second rate hike in the past decade, came on a unanimous 10-0 vote. The central bank also released updated forecasts that showed modest changes to its outlook for growth, unemployment and inflation, mainly to take account of a stronger economy and job market.\n\nJames Marple, senior economist at TDBank, said the Fed\u2019s forecast of three rate increases next year, up from two, was the \u201conly real surprise\u201d Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe move up is a signal that the Fed has become more confident in the economic outlook and that inflation will increasingly track closer to the 2 percent target,\u201d Marple said.\n\nIt\u2019s hardly guaranteed that the Fed\u2019s forecast for three hikes in 2017 will prove accurate. Last year at this time, for example, the Fed predicted it would raise rates four times in 2016. It turns out it\u2019s raising them just once.\n\nWednesday\u2019s rate increase should have little effect on mortgages or auto and student loans. The Fed doesn\u2019t directly affect those rates, at least not in the short run. But rates on some other loans \u2014 notably credit cards, home equity loans and adjustable-rate mortgages \u2014 will likely rise soon, though only modestly. Those rates are based on benchmarks like banks\u2019 prime rate, which moves in tandem with the Fed\u2019s key rate.\n\nAfter the Fed\u2019s announcement, several major banks announced that they were raising their prime rate from 3.50 percent to 3.75 percent.\n\n\u201cThis single quarter-point move in interest rates will go largely unnoticed at the household level, but coupled with last year\u2019s hike, the cumulative effect could mount quickly if the Fed quickens the pace of rate hikes in 2017,\u201d said Greg McBride, Bankrate.com\u2019s chief financial analyst.\n\nMortgage rates have been surging since Trump\u2019s presidential victory last month on expectations that his economic program would accelerate economic growth and inflation.\n\nStock investors appeared disappointed by the Fed\u2019s forecast of three rate increases in 2017. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down about 118 points \u2014 0.6 percent \u2014 a sign that stock investors are pricing in additional Fed rate hikes. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 2.57 percent from 2.47 percent\n\nYellen attributed the Fed\u2019s higher number of estimated rate hikes for 2017 to a lower unemployment rate and possibly some changes in federal budget policy beginning next year. But she emphasized that any changes to the Fed\u2019s projections were \u201cmodest.\u201d\n\nShe said Fed officials, during their meeting, discussed Trump\u2019s economic plans as well as the surge in stock prices, bond yields and the dollar that\u2019s followed his election. She said they reached no conclusions.\n\n\u201cWe are operating under a cloud of uncertainty at the moment, and we have time to wait and to see what changes occur and to factor those into our decision-making,\u201d she said.\n\nIn response to a question, Yellen said she plans to serve out her four-year term, which ends in February 2018. Most analysts don\u2019t expect her to remain after that.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s latest projections have the unemployment rate dipping to 4.5 percent by the end of 2017 and remaining at that level in 2018. It foresees economic growth reaching 1.9 percent this year and 2.1 percent in 2017, slightly more optimistic than it projected in September.\n\nThe central bank kept its long-term estimate for economic growth at 1.8 percent, far below the 4 percent pace that Trump has said he can achieve with his economic program.\n\nOverall, the Fed\u2019s policy statement showed only modest changes in wording from the previous meeting. It did note that inflation expectations \u201chave moved up considerably but still are low.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Christopher S.

When patients are left in ambulances, then the ambulances can no longer be used to transport new patients in medical emergencies. So the NHS has asked the Red Cross to help out by providing volunteers and use Land Rovers to transport patients.\n\nRed Cross chief Mike Adamson said:\n\nThe British Red Cross is on the front line, responding to the humanitarian crisis in our hospital and ambulance services across the country.\nWe have been called in to support the NHS and help get people home from hospital and free up much-needed beds.\nThis means deploying our team of emergency volunteers and even calling on our partner Land Rover to lend vehicles to transport patients and get the system moving.\nvar _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([\"embed\"]);We call on the UK government to allocate immediate funding to stabilize the current system and set out plans towards creating a sustainable funding settlement for the future.\n\nNot surprisingly, a politician like Adamson is simply calling for more money. I have been writing about the NHS for years, and the problem is that there is no more money.\n\nAs we reported a year ago, Britain\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) is facing an existential crisis, with a huge and accelerating deficit expected to reach 22 billion pounds ($32 billion) by 2020.\n\nThe system is corrupt, with doctors falsifying records, claiming for work that was never done, or putting in for bogus overtime. Dentistry services are so bad that people are buying \u201cdo-it-yourself (DIY) dentistry kits\u201d to take care of their whole families, as was done centuries ago.\n\nIn desperation to save money, many hospitals have had bed cuts, or have closed their Accident & Emergency departments (known in America as Emergency Rooms). Many maternity units have also been targeted for closure.\n\nIt would be nice if it were possible to give free health care to everyone, but it isn\u2019t. In America, both the Veterans Administration and Obamacare are financial disasters. At least the NHS was designed carefully enough that it was financially healthy for fifty years of its life, but Obamacare was so poorly designed that it\u2019s a financial disaster within five years of its life. Jonathan Gruber said that Obamacare passed because of \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter,\u201d and that same stupidity is continuing, in both America and Britain. London Evening Standard and Reuters and British Red Cross and Guardian (London, 10-Sep-2016)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nViolent protests in Sri Lanka over China\u2019s takeover of Hambantota seaport\n\nThousands of Sri Lanka\u2019s Buddhist monks and anti-government protesters held demonstrations on Saturday that turned violent, protesting China\u2019s takeover of Sri Lanka\u2019s Hambantota seaport by the Chinese in repayment of a debt to the Chinese incurred by the government.\n\nIn 2009, China invested $1.2 billion in the port as part of its \u201cstring of pearls\u201d strategy to surround India. Sri Lanka had expected to repay the debt through profits earned by the port, but the slowdown in trade throughout the entire region in the last few years has meant that Sri Lanka has been unable to repay the debt.\n\nNow Sri Lanka\u2019s government has been forced to give China a 99-year lease to take over the port. In addition, China will lease 15,000 acres in the region for an industrial zone for Chinese factories. China is expected to invest another $5 billion in Sri Lanka for industrial development.\n\nAt least 21 people were injured on Saturday in violent clashes between government supporters versus those opposed to the plan, the latter led by Buddhist monks. The two groups threw rocks at each other, and police responded with water cannon.\n\nOpponents of the plan say that thousands of people will lose their homes because of the project. They say that China will establish a \u201cChinese colony\u201d on Sri Lankan soil that will grow and can never be removed.\n\nSupporters of the plan say that China will invest $5 billion in the region, and the new industries will generation 100,000 new jobs.\n\nThere are other international implications. China will have responsibility for security at the port, which means that it the port will host the Chinese military, including warships and submarines.\n\nChina already has similar seaports in Myanmar, Bangladesh and Pakistan, and India is concerned that it\u2019s being surrounded by China\u2019s military and warships.

It is the second most populous county in the state with 109,000 residents, and one of only six counties in Montana that voted for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump.\n\nTrump defeated Clinton in the state by a 56 percent to 36 percent margin, but in Missoula County, Hillary Clinton won\u00a0\u00a0by a 53 percent to 37 percent margin.\n\nThe\u00a0Missoulian reported that \u201cMissoula County commissioners touched off a firestorm when they sent a letter to the U.S. State Department last winter saying they'd welcome the resettlement of 100 refugees a year to deal with the worldwide crisis, which has reached proportions not seen since the aftermath of World War II.\u201d\n\nOutside of Missoula County and Democratic Governor Steve Bullock, there is strong opposition to the resettlement of refugees in the state.\n\nIn Flathead County, whose 90,000 residents make it the fourth most populous county in the state, where Donald Trump won by a 65 percent to 29 percent margin, the\u00a0\u201cCounty Commission voted unanimously \u00a0[in March ] to send a letter to the federal government explicitly opposing refugee resettlement in Flathead County,\u201d The Flathead Beacon\u00a0reported, noting that local opposition to refugee resettlement was virtually unanimous:\n\nA standing-room-only crowd gathered at the commission's office in Kalispell for the March 10 meeting, with members of the public offering comment on the situation for about 15 minutes.\nEveryone who spoke opposed refugee resettlement here, with concerns of Sharia Law and the country's vetting process sprinkled through the comments. John Donoghue said he supported the commission's letter, and that while he is sympathetic to those who have lost their homes and livelihoods to war, he doesn't believe they should settle in the U.S. without thorough background checks.\n\nOf the 46 recently resettled refugees, 27 come from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 12 from Eritrea, 4 from Iraq, and 3 from Ethiopia.\n\nNo refugees were resettled in the state for more than three full years between October 1, 2012 and July 31, 2016. Prior to that, only one refugee was resettled in FY 2012. None were resettled in FY 2010 and FY 2011, and seven were resettled in FY 2009.\n\nBut that all ended in August when the first of the refugees invited by the Missoula County Commissioners, approved by the Department of State, and managed by the International Rescue Committee and a local group called Soft Landing Missoula, arrived in the state. The Associated Press reported:\n\nAn exhausted Congelese family of six experiencing culture shock has arrived in Missoula, the first of an anticipated 100 east African refugees expected to be resettled in Montana over the next year, a resettlement agency official said.\nThe family arrived last Thursday and International Rescue Committee Missoula director Molly Short Carr declined to identify them because of privacy concerns, but said three of the family\u2019s four children spent their entire lives in a Tanzanian refugee camp.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see them in the community and know they\u2019re here, but at the same time we need to remember they are individuals and may not want this information shared,\u201d Carr told the Missoulian in a story published Saturday.\nThe family has been placed in temporary housing. The IRC will help them apply for social services, Social Security cards, register the children for school and help the parents enroll in English classes. The parents speak Swahili and French.\n\nThe resettlement of refugees in Montana played a significant role in the state\u2019s Gubernatorial election, as the Associated Press noted:\n\nThe same week the family arrived in Missoula, Republican candidate for governor Greg Gianforte began mailing out fliers urging a halt to refugee resettlement in Montana.\nOne of the fliers shows Gianforte\u2019s opponent, Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock, pictured under an armed man whose face is covered by a kaffiyeh with the words, \u201cGovernor Bullock supports bringing Syrian refugees into Montana.\u201d\nThe flier calls for stopping \u201cany refugee resettlement until we know they can be properly vetted.\u201d\n\nIn November, Bullock narrowly defeated Gianforte, 50 percent to 46 percent and retained his job as governor, one of the few bright spots around the country for Democrats in the November elections.\n\nBullock\u2019s support for the refugee resettlement program presents a signficant hurdle for state legislators who wish to limit it or shut it down entirely.\n\nIn other states, such as Texas, New Jersey, and Kansas, governors have recently withdrawn from the federal refugee resettlement program, paving the way for a potential Tenth Amendment lawsuit similar to the one Tennessee is about to file in federal court.\n\nWith a cooperative governor in Montana, the Obama administration and resettlement agencies may feel emboldened to resettle as many refugees as possible prior to January 20, when Donald Trump will be inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States.\n\nTrump promised on the campaign trail he will pause the resettlement of refugees from Syria and other states hostile to the United States once in office.\n\nIt is unclear if the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, and Ethiopia and Iraq will fit that standard, but they may.\n\nThe push to resettle refugees in Montana comes as the Obama administration has doubled the number of refugees resettled in the entire country during the first three months of FY 2017, compared to FY 2016.\n\n\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 23, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.7353255748748797, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 871, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 6.49856945479, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 23, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161229030000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.32950631458094, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/12/01/kellogg-foundation-provided-nearly-1-million-support-black-lives-matter/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1746, 3814, 3839, 3853]}}, "headline": "Kellogg Foundation Provided Nearly $1 Million to Support Black Lives Matter", "wordcount_as_scraped": 580, "date": "20161201200000", "story_content": "The W.K.

Devin Nunes (R.-CA), the chairman of the committee.\n\n\u201cIt will take a long time to mitigate the damage he caused, and I look forward to the day when he returns to the United States to face justice,\u201d the chairman said.\n\nThe report contradicts the popular image of Snowden as a Robin Hood stealing government secrets and sharing them with the uninformed for the greater good.\n\nInstead, the report describes Snowden, who was a contract employee working for the CIA as a telecommunications information systems officer, as fabricator and serial exaggerator, who often argued with supervisors\u2013and who in November 2006, less than three months into the job, was already contacting the CIA\u2019s Office of the Inspector General about his boss\u2019s targeting him.\n\nAn example of his troublesome behavior cited in the report is how he handled a failed attempt at a promotion:\n\nA few months after starting in [redacted], Snowden asked to apply for a more senior\u00a0position in [redacted] as a regional communications officer. His supervisor did not endorse\u00a0his application. When he was not selected for the position, Snowden responded by starting\u00a0'a controversial e-mail exchange with very senior officers' in which he questioned the\u00a0selection board's professional judgement.\n\nThe report exhaustively tracks downs Snowden\u2019s statements and refutes them, such as going through records of his counseling and correspondence to find no evidence that Snowden ever expressed qualms about the morality of the surveillance programs or working for the CIA.\n\nInvestigators also interviewed Snowden\u2019s former colleagues and supervisors, who contradicted the TISO\u2019s claims that he was singled out for more responsibility or promotion. On supervisor told investigators that between October 2007 and April 2008, he counseled Snowden six times about his behavior at work.\n\n\"The Committee further found no evidence that Snowden attempted to communicate\u00a0concerns about the legality or morality of intelligence activities to any officials, senior or\u00a0otherwise, during his time at either CIA or NSA,\u201d according to the report.\n\nIn fact, the report makes the strong suggestion that Snowden used his hacking to cheat:\u00a0\"In September 2012, [Snowden] took a test to obtain a position in the Tailored Access\u00a0Operations office, or TAO, the group within NSA responsible for computer network\u00a0exploitation operations. After finding the test and its answers among the documents he had\u00a0taken off NSA networks, he passed the test.\"\n\nThe report also takes issue with Snowden\u2019s claims that he was motivated by a concern for civil liberties: \u201cMost of the material he stole had nothing to do with Americans' privacy, and its compromise has been of great value to America\u2019s adversaries and those who mean to do America harm,\u201d he said. \u201cWhistleblowers are important to proper oversight and we will protect them from retaliation, and those who engage in civil disobedience are willing to stay and face the consequences.\u201d\n\nThe committee\u2019s top Democrat Rep. Adam B.

In addition to the government\u2019s military, neighborhoods have organized vigilante groups to keep Boko Haram attacks at a minimum.\n\n\u201cSome members of the vigilance committees now have the ability to mystically eat the hearts of enemies or make them slaves by pronouncing incantations,\u201d Cameroonian marabout Baba Boukar told PRI\u2019s the\u00a0Global Post.\u00a0At least one vigilante who spoke to the\u00a0Post agreed, calling his cloth talisman \u201cso powerful\u2026 I put it on at the moment I go into the field of fighting\u2026 If someone shoots at you, the bullets have no effect. They fall on the ground like small pebbles.\"\n\nThere is some logic to the use of witchcraft to at least irritate Boko Haram. As members of the Islamic State, its leaders subscribe to the fundamentalist Wahhabi sect of Islam, for which suspicions of sorcery are punishable by death. In Syria and Iraq, the Islamic State has published numerous videos of violent executions, usually of women, for practicing sorcery or witchcraft.\n\n\u201cBoko Haram hates the marabouts: they\u00a0accuse them of being bad Muslims\u2026 taking advantage of their position to exploit the population,\u201d\u00a0journalist Lemine Ould M.

This announcement came as Texas reported its sixth locally-transmitted case of the virus.\n\n\"Zika continues to be a threat to pregnant women,\" said CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden in a press release Thursday. \"States, territories, and communities need this CDC funding to fight Zika and protect the next generation of Americans.\"\n\nThe award is part of\u00a0$184 million in federal funds the CDC allocated\u00a0to states, territories, local jurisdictions, and universities to combat Zika and other viruses plus associated health outcomes like\u00a0microcephaly, the abnormality that affects a baby\u2019s brain in utero. These federal dollars come from a larger $350 million package provided to the CDC\u00a0under the\u00a0Zika Response and Preparedness Appropriations Act of 2016.\n\nThe CDC divvied up $40 million of\u00a0the current allocation among four vector-borne disease regional centers of excellence: UTMB,\u00a0the University of Florida, the University of Wisconsin, and Cornell University.\n\nUTMB officials said they will release the details of how\u00a0the monies will be used in the coming weeks, according to the Galveston County Daily News. The university's medical branch is internationally known for infectious disease research, including its Galveston National Laboratory. It is one of two Biosafety Level 4 labs in the nation.\n\nThe CDC announcement came as the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) reported\u00a0the\u00a0sixth locally-transmitted Zika case in the border city of Brownsville, the\u00a0southern-most U.S. municipality\u00a0located directly across from Matamoros, Tamaulipas, a city at the center of a fierce cartel war.\n\nTexas became the second state to experience a \u201ctransmission cycle,\u201d meaning native mosquitoes get\u00a0infected and spread Zika through their bites. In February, DSHS officials first expressed\u00a0concern this would happen because the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that carry Zika are indigenous to the\u00a0state. Brownsville\u00a0reported\u00a0its first local mosquito-borne case in late November. Since then, the CDC\u00a0issued a travel warning to the border city after five individuals contracted Zika through area mosquitoes.\n\nDSHS Commissioner Dr. John Hellerstedt does not believe the virus will become widespread in Texas, although\u00a0he anticipates more cases, especially in the areas that stay relatively warm in the fall and winter. \u201cWhen the weather warms up again next year, it will pick up again, at least where it left off, and potentially go from there,\u201d he said according to Courthouse News Service.\n\nHowever, tropical medicine expert Dr. Peter Hotez,\u00a0dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine, foresees more widespread Zika transmission in 2017.\u00a0He wrote: \"Indeed we have to be alert for the likelihood that Zika transmission will become widespread next summer as\u00a0Aedes aegypti\u00a0populations predictably rise again.\"\n\nTexas spent most of 2016 on high alert for a \u201ctransmission cycle.\u201d By August, while Florida underwent such a cycle, Hellerstedt,\u00a0also the director of the governor's task force on infectious disease,\u00a0said local transmission was imminent. In addition to the state\u2019s\u00a0ongoing mosquito abatement efforts, the\u00a0DSHS urged Texans\u00a0to follow public health prevention guidelines, most notably, pregnant women whose unborn babies are most at-risk for birth defects like microcephaly\u00a0if infected with Zika. Texas Medicaid\u00a0offered free cans of mosquito repellent to eligible women ages 10 to 45 or pregnant through the end of October. Public health officials\u00a0reinstated\u00a0this program once Cameron County officials reported the first mosquito-borne Zika case in Brownsville.\n\nAs of December 21, the CDC accounted for 4,756 Zika cases nationwide. Of the 216 individuals who acquired the virus via local mosquitoes 210 are in Florida, six in Texas. All other instances were travel-associated, including the 38 sexually transmitted cases.\u00a0The DSHS last reported 283 Texas Zika cases as of\u00a0December 16.

Ryan also issued several press statements about the recent passage of the 21st Centuries Cures Act, which conservatives have described as \u201c1,000 page omnibus health care spending bill\u2026 loaded with handouts for special interests, all at the expense of the taxpayer.\u201d\n\nWhen Breitbart News\u00a0reached out to Ryan\u2019s office to ask if they\u00a0had issued a public press statement about the attack, they did not respond.\n\nThe Speaker\u2019s official Twitter page is\u00a0similarly quiet about the Ohio refugee attack. A\u00a0review of his\u00a0Twitter page shows that in the days following\u00a0the\u00a0attempted\u00a0mass\u00a0slaughter, Ryan\u2019s\u00a0team\u00a0posted 33 tweets and retweets about #CuresNow, as well as roughly 23\u00a0tweets and retweets about Speaker Ryan\u2019s\u00a0#ABetterWay agenda, and 10 tweets and retweets about President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s cabinet picks.\n\nThe only mention of the recent refugee attack on the Speaker\u2019s Twitter page came via\u00a0a single retweet of an Ohio Congressman, who had expressed\u00a0his condolences about the tragedy.\n\nSpeaker Ryan\u2019s Twitter did not contain\u00a0a single tweet\u2013 or even a\u00a0retweet\u2013 about the nation\u2019s federal immigration or refugee policy responsible for the attack. Nor did Speaker Ryan even craft\u00a0his own tweet to offer his personal condolences to the American\u00a0victims of the refugee attack.\n\nSimilarly, on\u00a0Speaker\u00a0Ryan\u2019s separate\u00a0campaign Twitter page, he\u00a0had\u00a0posted two tweets about football, but not a single tweet about the Ohio attack.\n\nCongressman Brian Babin, who last year introduced legislation to pause the refugee program\u2013legislation\u00a0which\u00a0Speaker Ryan decided not to advance\u2013said he has not heard Ryan \u201csay anything\u201d about the refugee program\u00a0in the days since the attack.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard him say anything about that,\u201d Babin told nationally-syndicated talk radio host Laura Ingraham on Thursday.\n\nTrump tweeted\u00a0that the Somali refugee behind\u00a0the attack \u201cshould not have been in our country.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News reached out to Speaker Ryan\u2019s office to ask if he now had any plans to bring up Babin\u2019s bill and to ask if he agreed\u00a0with Trump\u2019s declaration that the Somali refugee should never have been in the country in the first place.\n\nRyan\u2019s office did not respond to Breitbart News\u2019 inquiry.\n\nRyan\u2019s seemingly muted response\u00a0is interesting\u00a0given that the\u00a0tragedy could\u00a0have potentially hit home for Ryan\u2013as he himself had been a college student in Ohio. Indeed, multiple reports have noted\u00a0how it was during his\u00a0time at Miami University in Ohio, as a young public policy enthusiast\u00a0and a \u201cfrat boy\u201d\u00a0with a \u201cfondness for turtlenecks,\u201d\u00a0that\u00a0Ryan was \u201cable to find\u201d himself.\n\nRyan\u2019s decision not to\u00a0actively\u00a0speak out about\u00a0the attack\u00a0is similarly interesting in light of his longstanding support for the refugee programs that brought the attempted killer to Ohio State University.\n\nIndeed, at the time the\u00a0Ohio attacker, Abdul Razak Ali Artan, arrived in the United States in 2014 with his mother and six siblings, Ryan was\u00a0working behind the scenes\u00a0with open borders advocate Luis Gutierrez\u00a0to whip votes for President Obama\u2019s expansionist immigration agenda.\n\nAs\u00a0Conservative Review\u2019s Daniel Horowitz\u00a0has\u00a0noted,\u00a0the Obama-backed immigration\u00a0legislation that passed the Senate\u00a0\"would have created endless avenues for this president to bring in an unlimited numbers of Islamic immigrants from the most volatile corners of the world.\"\u00a0The\u00a0Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR)\u00a0similarly explained that\u00a0the Senate immigration bill\u00a0would have given\u00a0\u201cbroad authority to the Administration to create new categories of refugees and stateless persons to be admitted into the country.\"\n\nRyan\u2019s support for the refugee resettlement program has been well documented.\n\nLast year, after the Paris terror attack, Speaker Ryan told Sean Hannity that he did not want to cancel\u00a0the controversial refugee resettlement program, insisting that we should not allow the threat of terrorism to \u201cdictate\u201d our refugee policy.\n\nOne month later, Ryan chose to champion\u00a0an omnibus spending bill that fully-funded and even expanded President Obama\u2019s refugee resettlement operation. Ryan\u2019s spending bill funded visas\u00a0for nearly 300,000 (temporary and permanent) Muslim migrants in the course of a single year.\n\nIndeed, throughout\u00a0the 2016 election,\u00a0Ryan has repeatedly\u00a0ruled out\u00a0the possibility of making any cuts to Muslim migration\u2014 insisting that \"that's not who we are,\" and that\u00a0such a proposal is\u00a0\"not reflective of our principles.\"\n\nIn a June interview with the anti-Trump publication\u00a0The Huffington Post, Ryan even went so far as to\u00a0suggest\u00a0that he would sue a President Trump if he were to use his executive authority to temporarily pause Muslim migration into the United States.\n\nYet despite\u00a0Ryan\u2019s long record of pushing for expansionist immigration policies from third world nations and his repeated\u00a0efforts to undermine the candidacy of now President-elect Trump throughout the election, Ryan was re-nominated to serve as House Speaker on November 15th by a voice-vote of Republican lawmakers\u2014with the backing of many in\u00a0the House Freedom Caucus.\n\nRyan was nominated\u00a0by House Freedom Caucus Rep.

Levandowski claimed that with a stand-by driver \"behind the wheel\" making the vehicles \"less than fully autonomous,\" Uber does not need any California permit.\n\nThe hard-ball play by Uber comes as the company is under enormous and legal and regulatory assault worldwide, including the legality of utilizing contract operators without treating them as employees, and its failure to be awarded key ride-hailing patent rights.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Edward Chen in August denied Uber's $100 million offer to settle a class action lawsuit involving about 380,000 Uber drivers that were misclassified in the U.S. as contractors, rather than employees under state and federal labor law.\n\nTwo months later in October, Uber lost what was billed as the UK employment law \"case of the year,\" when an employment tribunal ruled that the correct legal definition for two of its \u201cApp Only\u201d PHV (Private Hire Vehicle) operators were \"employees,\" rather than \"partners.\" That means that approximately 60,000 Uber operators are entitled to all the \"attendant statutory protections\" of sick pay, minimum wage and guaranteed holiday time.\n\nGiven the similarity of labor laws in the European Union and the British Commonwealth nations around the world, the ruling my have significant ramifications impacting about 250,000 international drivers that can now sue Uber for misclassification financial damages.\n\nUber's ability to dominate the ride-hailing industry it created with the \"fundamental idea of a taxi-calling app\" rests entirely on U.S. Patent Application 13/672,658\u00a0that covers\n\nA method for determining a location relating to an on-demand service on a computing device is provided. One or more processors receiving a transport request from a user. The transport request specifies at least one of a pick-up region or a drop-off region\u2026\n\nBut U.S. Patent Office and the courts have refused to grant the issue of that patent several times. Uber is so desperate to secure the issuance of the application\u00a0that it is\u00a0still making further appeals for a \u201cRequest of Continued Examination,\u201d according to report by\u00a0Seeking Alpha's Andrew Connor.\n\nGeneral Motors, which made a $500 million investment in Uber rival Lyft, acquired the intellectual property rights of former ride-sharing company Sidecar. One analyst suggests that the Sidecar acquisition now gives GM \"the power to shut down Uber\" in the ride-hailing business.\n\nUber now faces an enormous set of legal and financial challenges due to\u00a0its current business model relying on individual drivers using their own vehicles for \"ride-hailing.\" But with 34 issued patents, including 8 acquired recently from Microsoft, Uber is positioned to dominate a \"ride-dispatch\" service that relies on self-driving cars owned by Uber.\n\nGoogle and insurance interests led an intensive lobbying campaign in 2012 to pass several pieces of California\u00a0legislation\u00a0that authorized the DMV to create regulatory rules and implement autonomous vehicle tests across the state.\n\nUber was only a start-up at that time, but has been actively lobbying the DMV in Sacramento over the last two years regarding issues surrounding ride-hailing services and autonomous vehicle regulations.\n\nUber may be calculating that the potential implosion they face with their current business model is so risky, it may be worth \"betting the farm\" in a battle to convince Gov. Brown and the Democrat-controlled Legislature that California needs to fully-deploy autonomous vehicles.\n\nBeverly Hills has already planned for \u201ca robot fleet of mass transit vehicles\u201d to ease traffic in the congested area \u2014 hence the mayor\u2019s support for Uber.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.42118859291077, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 699, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 12, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 7, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.8932023827900006, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 38, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161219150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.4363376251788305, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.45454545455}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/jerusalem/2016/12/24/rosanne-barr-obamas-anti-israel-un-action-like-nazis-enacted-anti-jewish-laws-eve-jewish-holidays/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [362, 407, 1532, 1580, 2050, 6327, 6352, 6366]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 839, "scraper_regex": 957}}, "headline": "Roseanne Barr: Obama's Anti-Israel UN Action Like 'Nazis Who Enacted Anti-Jewish Laws on the Eve of Jewish Holidays'", "wordcount_as_scraped": 957, "date": "20161224220000", "story_content": "TEL AVIV \u2014 Actress and comedian Roseanne Barr excoriated President Obama on Twitter for abstaining from a UN Security Council vote that passed on Friday demanding a halt in Israeli construction in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem and referring\u00a0to those lands as \"Palestinian territories.\"\u00a0\n\nBarr compared Obama's abstention, which allowed the anti-Israel resolution to pass, with \"Nazis\" who \"enacted anti-Jewish laws on the eve of Jewish holidays-exactly as @POTUS has done on eve of Hanukkah.\"\n\nShe sent out the following tweets:\n\nnazis enacted anti jewish laws on the eve of jewish holidays-exactly as @POTUS has done on eve of Hanukkah.

In actuality, the Palestinians never had a state in either the West Bank or eastern Jerusalem and they are not legally recognized as the undisputed authority in those areas.\n\nJordan occupied and annexed the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem from 1948 until Israel captured the lands in a defensive war in 1967 after Arab countries used the territories to launch attacks against the Jewish state. \u00a0In 1988 Jordan officially renounced its claims to the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem.\n\nThe text of the resolution declares that the Israeli settlement enterprise has \"no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace.\"\n\nIt calls for Israel to \"immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem.\"\n\nAs the Committee for Accuracy for Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA) pointed out in an email blast, international law does not make Israeli settlements illegal.\n\nCAMERA notes:\n\nArticle 49 of the Fourth Geneva Conventions, which is relied upon by those who claim the settlements are illegal, does not apply in the case of the West Bank. This is because the West Bank was never under self-rule by a nation that was a party to the Convention, and therefore there is no \"partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party,\" as Article 2 of the Convention specifies. Moreover, even if it did apply, by its plain terms, it applies only to forcible transfers and not to voluntary movement. Therefore, it can't prohibit Jews from choosing to move to areas of great historical and religious significance to them.\n\nThe resolution contradicts a Bush administration commitment to allowing some existing Jewish settlements to remain under a future Israeli-Palestinian deal.\n\nThat U.S. commitment, which the Obama administration has repeatedly violated by condemning settlement activity, was reportedly a key element in Israel's decision to unilaterally evacuate the Gaza Strip in 2005.\n\nThe UN draft resolution text states that \"cessation of all Israeli settlement activities is essential for salvaging the two-State solution,\" and it \"calls for affirmative steps to be taken immediately to reverse the negative trends on the ground that are imperiling the two-State solution.\"\n\nIn 2004, just prior to the Gaza evacuation, President Bush issued a declarative letter stating that it is unrealistic to expect that Israel will not retain some Jewish settlements in a final-status deal with the Palestinians.\n\nThe letter stated:\n\nIn light of new realities on the ground, including already existing major Israeli populations centers, it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949, and all previous efforts to negotiate a two-state solution have reached the same conclusion. It is realistic to expect that any final status agreement will only be achieved on the basis of mutually agreed changes that reflect these realities.\n\nElliott Abrams, the Deputy National Security Adviser for Global Democracy Strategy during Bush's second term, was instrumental in brokering understandings between the U.S. and Israel on settlements. In a June 2009 piece published by the Wall Street Journal, Abrams accused the Obama administration of \"abandoning\" those U.S.-Israel understandings by taking positions critical of all settlement activity.\n\nAbrams wrote:\n\nThere were indeed agreements between Israel and the United States regarding the growth of Israeli settlements on the West Bank \u2026 principles that would permit some continuing growth. \u2026 They emerged from discussions with American officials and were discussed by Messrs. Sharon and Bush at their Aqaba meeting in June 2003. \u2026 The prime minister of Israel relied on them in undertaking a wrenching political reorientation \u2013 the dissolution of his government, the removal of every single Israeli citizen, settlement and military position in Gaza, and the removal of four small settlements in the West Bank. \u2026 For reasons that remain unclear, the Obama administration has decided to abandon the understandings about settlements reached by the previous administration with the Israeli government. We may be abandoning the deal now, but we cannot rewrite history and make believe it did not exist.\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

If FFRF follows through and files in federal court, that case could result in a historic restoration of religious liberty nationwide.\n\nSt. Bernard is a suburb of Cincinnati. For many years, the city has displayed a cr\u00e8che \u2014\u00a0i.e., a Nativity scene \u2014 during the Christmas season. It is accompanied by non-biblical seasonal holiday displays as well, making this outdoor cr\u00e8che similar to the one the Supreme Court upheld in its 1984 case Lynch v. Donnelly.\n\nHowever, in 1989, the Supreme Court moved to the left on this issue, holding by a narrow 5-4 vote in County of Allegheny v. ACLU Greater Pittsburgh Chapter that a cr\u00e8che erected on the grand staircase of a Pittsburgh courthouse violated the Constitution's Establishment Clause (which provides that Congress cannot establish a religion, a rule the Court in 1947 extended to state and local governments). In Allegheny, the justices voted 6-3 to allow a menorah and Christmas tree in the park outside the courthouse.\n\nThat case was strongly denounced by originalists and conservatives\u00a0because it invented a brand new standard called the \"endorsement test\" for the First Amendment's Establishment Clause. Under this new rule, any government action involving faith or religion is unconstitutional if some \"reasonable observer\" would believe the government was endorsing religion.\n\nFour justices dissented in Allegheny, with moderate Justice Anthony Kennedy writing the dissent. In it, he argued that this new endorsement test is unnecessarily hostile to religion and not required by the Constitution. The cr\u00e8che, Christmas tree, and menorah are all consistent with the Constitution, he argued.\n\nInstead, he continued, the true test of whether the government is establishing a religion is whether it officially adopts an actual religious belief as public policy (such as passing a law saying that the bread and wine in communion is the actual body and blood of Jesus Christ), or whether the government is coercing a person to participate in a religious activity that violates his conscience.\n\nIn 2014, Kennedy wrote in another Establishment Clause case, Town of Greece v. Galloway, that he still holds the same view he expressed in 1989. But in 2014, Kennedy was writing for a 5-4 majority (including Justice Antonin Scalia). This indicating that if President-elect Donald Trump nominates someone to Scalia's seat someone in the same mold as the iconic originalist justice, the Supreme Court could very well overrule Allegheny, restoring countless traditional faith-based expressions, traditions, and displays \u2014 including Nativity scenes.\n\nOne case\u00a0is currently only one step beneath the Supreme Court \u2014\u00a0American Human Association v. Maryland-National Capital Park & Planning Commission & The American Legion\u00a0\u2014 could present the justices with an opportunity to jettison the \"endorsement test\" in favor of the historically grounded \"coercion test.\" That case, currently before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, involves a decades-old World War I memorial that is being attacked by atheists because it includes a large cross.\n\nLike war memorials, a cr\u00e8che passes muster under the coercion test because quiet roadside war memorials and Christmas displays don't coerce anyone to do anything. If you don't like it, you don't have to look at it. In a free society people regularly see and hear things they don't like. That does not mean the Constitution forbids those things.\n\nThe War on Christmas continues, but it appears that the tide of that battle may be turning soon.\n\nKen Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News and senior counsel at First Liberty Institute, the largest law firm in America exclusively dedicated to protecting religious liberty.

Conservative and libertarian students are already at a financial disadvantage when it comes to planning campus events because they are often forced to pay security fees that their progressive counterparts have the luxury to forego.\n\nI wrote in October about a concerning new trend in campus censorship which involved administrators spiking security fees for events hosted by conservative and libertarian student groups, typically with just a few days to spare\u00a0before an event is set to take place. Students at the University of Maryland, who were preparing to host an event with Breitbart Senior editor Milo Yiannopoulos, were asked to provide the university with an additional $6,500 in fees just days prior to the event\u2019s scheduled date. After failing to raise the money, the students were forced to cancel the event, and the University of Maryland successfully blocked MILO from speaking on campus under the guise of their concerns for student safety.\n\nSince then, administrators at Iowa State and Minnesota State have hit student groups planning to host Breitbart Senior editor Milo Yiannopoulos with\u00a0last-minute security fee hikes. This slippery tactic from college adminstrators is spreading fast.\n\nInterestingly, all of the institutions that have tried to block MILO from speaking with this form of censorship have been public universities. In that October column, I mentioned an important 1992 Supreme Court case in which the court decided that public universities were not permitted to vary security fees for political events based upon an administrator's subjective determination of \"the amount of hostility likely to be created by the speech based on its content.\"\n\nIt is important to note the distinction between a demand for increased security based upon the content of speech and a demand for increased security based upon the anticipated volatility of an audience's reaction to said content. With regards to the incident at the University of Maryland, security fees were increased not as a result of the content of Milo's speech, but out of concerns that their students wouldn't be able to behave when faced with ideas that conflict with their own.\n\n\"Speech cannot be financially burdened, any more than it can be punished or banned, simply because it might offend a hostile mob,\" the Forsyth Court wrote, noting that \"[t]hose wishing to express views unpopular with bottle throwers, for example, may have to pay more for their permit.\"\n\nJust this week, students at Minnesota State University, who had arranged to host MILO on December 15, were hit with an increased security fee. One of the student organizers who helped to plan the event believes that the increased fee is an attempt by the university to shut down their speech:\u00a0\"This was I believe a tactic to have us cancel the event because they don't think we can raise that money and we will but then they just got benefit of draining us of more of our resources\" he continued. \"We want the bullying of conservatives on liberal campuses to stop.\"\n\nIt is not a coincidence that university administrators have ramped up their deceitful form of censorship following Trump\u2019s victory in November\u2019s presidential election. Trump-supporting students at universities across the nation have been shamed into a quiet corner of their campus and made to believe that they are responsible for the fear that\u00a0some students claim they now have as a result of the election.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.49197864532471, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 875, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.22311623612, "HarmVirtue": 15, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 19, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161201230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.17142857142857, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.72727272727}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/12/20/new-yorker-illegal-immigrants-brace-trump/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [971, 1723, 1976], "\u00a0": [3406], "\u00f3": [1416, 1704]}}, "headline": "The New Yorker: Illegal Immigrants \u2018Brace\u2019 for Trump", "wordcount_as_scraped": 531, "date": "20161221030000", "story_content": "BROOKLYN, New York \u2013 The New Yorker is alerting illegal immigrants to \"brace\" for President-Elect Donald Trump's administration, which has vowed to enforce existing federal immigration laws and crack-down on unlawful border crossings.\n\nThe New Yorker piece on the well-being of illegal immigrants in the country focuses on the \"states of anxiety\" since the Presidential election.

It has some prominent\u00a0conservative advocates, including Charles Murray today, and luminaries such as Friederich Hayek and Milton Friedman in the past. In various versions of the basic income plan, everyone is paid the same stipend from the government, or everyone whose income falls below a certain line.\n\nFinland's experiment is beginning with a small pool of people who were previously collecting unemployment benefits or income subsidies. As\u00a0CNN Money\u00a0describes it, the program's 2,000 enrollees will now receive the equivalent of $587 per month for a period of two years. The income is guaranteed no matter what happens to the participants, including full employment. This promise is meant to eliminate the problem of unemployed people deciding not to work because it would cut into their benefits.\u00a0\n\nCNN Money notes a similar, but much smaller and means-tested, program running in the Italian city of Livorno since June. Guaranteed minimum programs are also under consideration in Canada, Iceland, Uganda, and Brazil. Switzerland considered a $2500 per month minimum income last year, but the referendum was rejected by over 75 percent of voters. \n\nRussia's Sputnik News recalls that critics of the Swiss program called it a \"Marxist dream\" and warned financing it would require huge tax increases, or cuts to other government programs. Also, they worried about \"economic chaos from citizens quitting their jobs en masse.\"\n\nThese arguments cover the yin and yang of the Guaranteed Minimum Income idea. Advocates believe it will dissolve the massively inefficient, corrupt, complicated, and redundant welfare state. (A notable feature of the program in Finland is the absence of paperwork \u2013 no need to submit any status reports to the government, as is required under traditional unemployment programs.) \n\nCritics worry about the cost, the disincentives to work, and the inevitable pressure to keep raising the minimum income. Imagine what the people who currently agitate for $15 minimum wages would to a $587 minimum income. Among other headaches, the radically different costs of living in the huge United States would introduce complexities not seen in small, relatively homogenous countries.\n\nWriting at Forbes, Tim Worstall recalls that Milton Friedman discarded the Guaranteed Minimum Income idea in favor of subsidizing the poor through tax rebates, in what ultimately became the Earned Income Tax Credit.\n\nWorstall also cites the veritable Mjolnir of a tax hammer\u00a0which hangs over the British unemployed and under-employed, and which threatens to grab up to 80 percent of what they earn in a job. Finland's experiment completely removes that disincentive for the 2,000 test subjects, while other unemployed Finns will still have to deal with it. We should, therefore, get an idea of whether the Guaranteed Minimum Income is less of a job- and wealth-killer than traditional welfare plans, which would go a long way toward defraying the cost of such a program.\n\nIn a new column for the Wall Street Journal this week, Charles Murray addresses the criticism of guaranteed income up front:\n\nWhen people learn that I want to replace the welfare state with a universal basic income, or UBI, the response I almost always get goes something like this: \"But people will just use it to live off the rest of us!\" \"People will waste their lives!\" Or, as they would have put it in a bygone age, a guaranteed income will foster idleness and vice. I see it differently. I think that a UBI is our only hope to deal with a coming labor market unlike any in human history and that it represents our best hope to revitalize American civil society.\n\nHe addresses that \"idleness and vice\" problem by noting that we already have it, with 18 percent of unmarried working-age men and 23% of women out of the labor force and receiving benefits, and proposes his UBI plan could lead some people to indolence, but would also bring marginal workers back into the labor force, since they could earn up to $30k without losing any of their simple cash benefit.\n\nMurray's proposal is for every American citizen age 21 and over to receive $13,000 per year, paid in monthly installments, with $3,000 of it earmarked for health insurance. The net result is that every American citizen would be paid $833 by the government, every month, for life (with a bit of means testing, as described below) and the rest of the welfare state goes away:\n\nPeople can make up to $30,000 in earned income without losing a penny of the grant. After $30,000, a graduated surtax reimburses part of the grant, which would drop to $6,500 (but no lower) when an individual reaches $60,000 of earned income. Why should people making good incomes retain any part of the UBI? Because they will be losing Social Security and Medicare, and they need to be compensated.\nThe UBI is to be financed by getting rid of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, housing subsidies, welfare for single women and every other kind of welfare and social-services program, as well as agricultural subsidies and corporate welfare. As of 2014, the annual cost of a UBI would have been about $200 billion cheaper than the current system. By 2020, it would be nearly a trillion dollars cheaper.\n\nMurray, like virtually every other pundit and analyst writing about Finland's guaranteed-income experiment, notes the idea has gained renewed currency due to the rising threat of advanced automation.\u00a0If projections that nearly half of all jobs could be threatened by artificial intelligence in the years to come, a new paradigm for the social safety net is needed.\n\n\"We are approaching a labor market in which entire trades and professions will be mere shadows of what they once were,\" Murray warns. \n\nHe makes a provocative argument that Universal Basic Income would disintegrate so much of our overbearing federal and state governments, and put so much wasted money back into the pockets of wage earners, that it would inject \"new energy into an American civic culture that has historically been one of our greatest assets, but that has deteriorated alarmingly in recent decades.\" \n\nIn other words, the people would devise efficient local solutions to poverty issues, and the unfettered marketplace would create opportunities for marginal labor, while the ambitious would not be shackled.\n\nAnother interesting idea floated by Murray is a social realignment, brought about by the sure and certain knowledge that everyone gets the same monthly government stipend. Few could claim to be destitute due to forces utterly beyond their control. The weight of poor decisions would fall heavily upon the irresponsible, with reduced sympathy from the prudent.\n\nBut that's also where we find the most devastating argument against the Universal Basic Income idea: at least in the United States, it won't be possible to get rid of that overweening government and bloated welfare state, due to the existing social pressures. The danger of getting stuck with UBI as just one more bloated social program,\u00a0in addition to what the Great Society and New Deal already created, is not merely a concern \u2013 it's an absolute certainty.\n\nLiberal groups, sympathetic elected politicians, and most of the extremely powerful federal bureaucracy would fight the most savage political battle we have ever seen to retain at least some of the social programs Murray envisions eliminating. (Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are among them; all by themselves, they make the UBI concept a pipe dream.) \n\nImagine the wailing and rending of garments over the soaring unemployment rate of government workers, if universal-income advocates burned down the welfare state. They\u2019d be accused of wanting to \u201ckill\u201d a million jobs, in addition to menacing\u00a0the poor by taking away programs that currently provide far more than $13,000 per year in benefits.\n\nEven if advocates developed the political muscles to implement such a sweeping reform, it wouldn't last. Advocacy groups would begin pushing for the return of some programs immediately, or for dramatic increases in the guaranteed income amount. In vast America, some of this pressure would be regional: \"You can't expect a New Yorker to live on the same amount of money as a family in rural Alabama!\" \n\nRemember how ObamaCare was pushed with carefully-selected sob stories of people who couldn't get insurance under the old health insurance rules? Multiply that a hundredfold, and you'll have some idea of the pressure to reinstate programs that shelter the homeless, or feed impoverished children, or give counseling services. \n\nClass-war pressures would slam into the UBI system at once, with loud agitation for the higher-income surtaxes Murray proposes to be increased. There is no way people in the highest income brackets would be allowed to keep that minimal $6,500. Social Security is protected by the political illusion that it's a \"trust fund\" beneficiaries \"own\" because they \"paid into\" the account during their working lives. No such illusion would keep UBI safe for people who make more than whatever constantly-dwindling income makes you a \"millionaire\" in the eyes of the Left.\n\nThe welfare state will find other ways to reappear, even if the social programs replaced by the UBI are kept off the books. Public schools would be an ideal delivery system for supposedly obsolete welfare benefits. We're talking about a society whose left wing currently argues that college should be \"free.\" \n\nThe outgoing President, whose approval ratings are said to be over 50 percent, once called current House Speaker Paul Ryan a \"Social Darwinist\" (i.e. he wants to murder poor people to improve the quality of the population) because he proposed modest cuts to federal spending, in a bid to stave off inevitable federal bankruptcy. Imagine if he\u2019d proposed \u201cwiping out the social safety net\u201d and replacing it with a monthly stipend, paid to rich and poor alike.\n\nIt's unfortunate to dismiss an idea as little more than a thought experiment because implementation is politically impossible. Maybe, just maybe, that looming threat of automation will trigger the kind of social change needed to make the even more powerful social change wrought by a pure minimum-income system possible. Unfortunately, foolish labor, education, and immigration policies have left us very little time to adapt.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.515625, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1648, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.8871563839, "HarmVirtue": 18, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 18, "mft_sum": 38, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170105050000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.3058252427184502, "mft_mean": 3.45454545455}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/01/09/mitt-romney-betsy-devos-will-challenge-education-establishment/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [2486]}}, "headline": "Mitt Romney: Betsy DeVos Would Challenge the 'Education Establishment'", "wordcount_as_scraped": 908, "date": "20170109160000", "story_content": "Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney is applauding the nomination of Betsy DeVos to run the federal education department.\n\nIn an op-ed at the Washington Post, Romney asserts that DeVos would challenge \"the education establishment,\" which has a \"financial stake\" in the current system.\n\nThe former Massachusetts governor also observes that \"a lot of money is at stake\" in the debate over DeVos, whose confirmation hearing is scheduled for January 11.\n\n\"Essentially, it's a debate between those in the education establishment who support the status quo because they have a financial stake in the system and those who seek to challenge the status quo because it's not serving kids well,\" he writes.\n\nRomney portrays DeVos as \"someone who isn't financially biased shaping education,\" and as \"someone who will challenge the conventional wisdom and status quo.\"\n\nParent and education activists who have been battling against the \"establishment\" of both political parties, however, are reacting to Breitbart News about Romney's views of DeVos.\n\n\"Mr. Romney seems confused about what constitutes the education establishment in this country,\" states Jane Robbins, senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based American Principles Project.\n\n\"Mrs. DeVos and the organizations she has either founded, funded, or helped lead are an integral part of the establishment that many thousands of parents have been fighting for years now,\" Robbins adds. \"Those parents are the real anti-establishment heroes, but they\u2019ve been consistently ignored. We hope Mrs. DeVos will start to listen to them.\"\n\nOhio parent activist Heidi Huber tells Breitbart News that Romney's endorsement of DeVos as an \"anti-establishment\" maverick of sorts is \"laughable,\" given that he has been an \"anti-Trumper.\"\n\n\"If the establishment\u2019s history of self-awareness deficit wasn\u2019t so widely known, one might think Romney was trying to sabotage the confirmation,\" Huber asserts. \"One can only hope that Romney\u2019s endorsement of DeVos will be as inversely effective as his public denouncement of Trump.\"\n\nA leader of grassroots parents, teachers, and citizens against federal control of education, Huber's observation is that Romney is \"unaware of the contradiction of his case,\" and cites his boasting of the education successes in his home state of Massachusetts. In his op-ed, the former governor wrote:\n\nMassachusetts has consistently ranked No. 1\u00a0among all 50 states on the federal National Assessment of Educational Progress exams. I believe that there are many reasons for this success. Among them are a statewide curriculum developed by our own educators; a state exam in math, science and English required to graduate from high school; extensive school choice among standard public schools, charter schools, public exam schools, private schools, Catholic schools and cyber schools; superb teachers; and involved parents. Massachusetts has also benefited from creative political leadership on both sides of the aisle and from remarkable flexibility by our education unions.\n\nHowever, as Huber notes, Romney cites the successes in the Bay State prior to Gov. Deval Patrick (D)'s decision to force the social justice education reform known as Common Core upon Massachusetts students.\n\nJamie Gass, education director at the Boston-based Pioneer Institute, described at Breitbart News the results once Common Core became the state's standards:\n\nToday Massachusetts' SAT scores are down 20 points from their 2006 highs. Third-grade reading scores are the best predictor of future academic success. Last year, after several years of stagnation, the percentage of Massachusetts third-graders who scored proficient or advanced on MCAS reading tests fell to its lowest level since 2009. At 57 percent, the portion of third-graders reading at or above the proficient level is 10 points lower than it was in 2002.\nResults from the 2013 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), known as the nation's report card, tell a similarly disturbing story. Massachusetts' five-point decline in fourth-grade reading was the largest in the country. Weaker national standards are unlikely to staunch the bleeding.\n\n\"Rather than reaching the natural conclusion that a leader familiar with the Massachusetts overhaul would be the ideal nominee,\" Huber continues, \"Romney's conclusion is: 'The answers for improving our nation's schools will come from people who have no financial stake in the outcome and study the most successful education systems here and around the world.'\u201d\n\nHuber responds:\n\nWrong, Mitt. As Massachusetts\u2019 success proves, the answers lie within our local communities and states, not with a billionaire known for buying political influence. If Betsy DeVos was the right nominee, she would be recommending that the states look to the pre-Common Core Massachusetts\u2019 design as their blueprint and then she\u2019d get to work on dismantling the corrupt FedEd complex known as the U.S. Dept. of Education. That\u2019s when the interests of our children will finally prevail.\n\nAs Robbins and Huber suggest, Romney's review of the \"debate\" over DeVos makes no mention of the grassroots base of the Republican Party that has been battling against the Common Core standards and what the reform represents \u2013 greater federal control of education.\n\nOklahoma parent activist Jenni White says DeVos is clearly a member of the \"Republican Establishment.\"\n\n\"In fact, that may be my biggest concern with DeVos \u2013 her track record of 'buying' legislation and growing government in the name of education,\" White tells Breitbart News. \"How will this past (and her current associations with Common Core supporters like Jeb Bush, Mitt Romney and others) translate to a job in the public sector at an agency that doesn't even have a Constitutional mandate to exist yet sucks massive amounts of dollars out of our pockets to justify its existence?\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 870, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.6770451665699992, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170109160000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.10344827586207, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/12/06/islamic-radicalism-rife-asylum-homes-according-undercover-report/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [104, 314, 631, 870, 970, 1420, 1442, 1681, 1751, 1883, 2225, 2402, 2416, 3019], "\u00fc": [784, 1892, 2232], "\u00e4": [1125]}}, "headline": "Undercover Report: Islamic Radicalism Rife in \u2018Hotbed of Terror\u2019 Asylum Homes", "wordcount_as_scraped": 549, "date": "20161206150000", "story_content": "German-Pakistani journalist\u00a0Shams Ul-Haq went undercover to several German asylum homes under false identities and found them full of radical Islamic recruiters and believers.\n\nA former taxi driver and private investigator, Pakistan-born\u00a0Shams Ul-Haq now works as a freelance journalist in Germany, where he has lived for 15 years.

A Libyan he met said that he had been studying in Germany and didn\u2019t want to go home so applied for asylum and pretended he didn\u2019t know any German.\n\nMigrants who had been living in Germany for a long time even frequented the asylum homes, Ul-Haq claims, saying that they would stop by to use the free internet, eat free food, see doctors on site, and even bank pocket money despite the fact they didn\u2019t live there.\n\nWhile Ul-Haq does not believe that every radicalised\u00a0asylum seeker will commit terror attacks, he says that they play a role in the infrastructure of Islamic state cells, passing on messages to those who will conduct attacks. \u201cThey are considered cannon fodder, and when a cell goes on the run, it is them who are first arrested by the police,\u201d he said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 0, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.23684215545654, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 551, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 0.8907235428299999, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 3, "mft_sum": 5, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161206150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 0.9074410163339379, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.45454545454499995}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/12/02/mosul-suicide-bombers-stopped-road-craters/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e1": [3349], "\u00a0": [382, 567, 776, 1080, 1106, 1542, 1643, 1916, 2591, 3347]}}, "headline": "Mosul: Anti-Islamic State Coalition \u2018Cratering\u2019 Roads to Stop Suicide Bombers", "wordcount_as_scraped": 522, "date": "20161203040000", "story_content": "U.S.-led coalition officials involved in the operation to eradicate the Islamic State from Mosul say they have succeeded in curbing the number of vehicle-based suicide bomb attacks on Iraqi troops on the ground by \u201ccratering\u201d the city\u2019s roads and knocking down its bridges.\n\nThe Kurdish outlet Rudaw cites\u00a0Deputy Commander for Combined Joint Task Force for Operation Inherent Resolve Maj. Gen. Rupert Jones as telling reporters that Islamic State terrorists were now limited in their use of\u00a0vehicle-born improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs) because they could no longer easily drive around the city. Inherent Resolve is the U.S.-led coalition\u2019s name for the operation to eradicate the Islamic State\u00a0from its last stronghold in Iraq \u2014 Mosul.\n\n\u201cThe coalition disabled four of the five bridges in Mosul and \u2018cratered\u2019 roads used by ISIS with their VBIEDs,\u201d Rudaw reports.\n\n\"This combination of the two tactics seems to be reducing the number of VBIEDs that the enemy has been able to use,\" Maj.

The fight has been slow and bloody, with Baghdad announcing that 2,000 Iraqi soldiers, allied Shiite militia fighters, and Kurdish Peshmerga soldiers had been killed since mid-October. This is nearly double the number of Islamic State fighters reportedly killed as announced earlier this week. In addition, 74,000 civilians have reportedly abandoned Mosul, flooding neighboring northern Iraqi areas.\n\nThe thousand bodies of Islamic State jihadists largely remain on the streets of Mosul, with civilians demanding the Iraqi military remove them before they rot and potentially contaminate the city\u2019s limited water supply. Those\u00a0in the liberated areas of the city are struggling to feed their families, with some reports noting that Iraqi soldiers have had to share their food with civilians.\n\nIn ISIS-controlled areas, the Islamic State has begun executing civilians attempting to flee.

At least one police vehicle was burned.\nWindows were shattered at many businesses, and storefronts were tagged with graffiti, much of it demeaning Trump.\n\nSan Jose:\u00a0The\u00a0East Bay Times reports:\n\nIn San Jose, a peaceful crowd numbering in the hundreds gathered at San Jose State's Olympic Black Power Statue to rally against the election of Trump.\nA number of students shouted to the crowd, \"We are the change.

The nation averages 1,000 injuries a year involving firecrackers between the last day of the old year and the first day of the new one, according to the Agence France-Presse. By the end of Sunday, however, Manila documented only 350 injuries of this nature nationwide, two involving consumption of the explosives.\n\n\"People are now afraid to light firecrackers because of the president,\"\u00a0Health Secretary Paulyn Ubial told reporters.\u00a0\"They have this impression that somehow they will get caught or they will be punished.\"\n\nOfficials described the decline in firecracker accidents as \u201cremarkable.\u201d\n\nDuterte, who took office in June 2016, won the presidency by promising a strict law and order presidency in which police would be fully empowered to combat the nation\u2019s rampant drug trade. Duterte offered a bounty to anyone who killed or apprehended drug suspects and has repeatedly promised to exonerate police who kill civilians suspected, but not charged, with drug-related crimes. Duterte has also claimed to have personally killed people as mayor of Davao City that he suspected of engaging in drug crimes and thrown people out of helicopters. Last month, Duterte threatened to burn down the United Nations headquarters in New York.\n\nHis rhetoric has resulted in most Philippine nationals fretting for their lives. A December poll by the statistics firm Social Weather Stations (SWS) found that 78 percent of Filipinos\u00a0are either \"somewhat worried\" or \"very worried\" about being killed by police. As a testament to how dire the drug situation remains in the Philippines, 85 percent of respondents said they approved of the drug war, giving Duterte an \u201cexcellent\u201d approval rating.\n\nCNN Philippines cites the \u201cpiccolo\u201d variety of firecrackers as the most dangerous and responsible for most of the injuries this year. Piccolo firecrackers are largely marketed towards children\u00a0\u2014 bearing the name of a Dragonball Z character and often carrying the names of popular Philippine figures like boxing champion and senator Manny Pacquiao \u2014 and are easily and inexpensively acquired despite their illegal status. CNN notes this variety is \u201ctoxic and causes the most injuries to children every year. Usually, piccolo causes injuries whenever children ingest it.\u201d\n\nSome inventors have attempted to bring to market safer alternatives to the traditional firecrackers. the head of the\u00a0Filipino Inventors Society Producers Cooperative (FISPC), Francisco Pagayon, debuted an electronic \u201cfirecracker\u201d this year named after Duterte, the \u201cDigong,\u201d as well as a \u201cTrump\u201d variety intended to attract consumers worried for their health. \u201cHe explained that e-firecrackers produce rapid explosive sounds, without causing an actual explosion,\u201d the\u00a0Philippine Star reported, adding that they are meant to simulate the explosion of a \u201cpiccolo.\u201d\n\nDuterte has vocally opposed the use of firecrackers on New Year\u2019s Eve due to their dangerous nature\u00a0and banned them as mayor of southern Davao City in 2001. Davao recorded zero firecracker-related injuries during the course of this weekend. The president\u00a0threatened to ban firecrackers before the new year came but was unable to organize the legislative majorities required.

(Of the two judges voting to affirm the lower court, one was appointed by Bill Clinton, the other by Barack Obama.)\n\nJudge David McKeague vigorously dissented, writing:\n\nThe district court justified its decision by concluding that Stein had shown \"a likelihood of success on the merits\" of the claim that the two-day waiting period could result in a violation of the First Amendment right to vote, with even identifying any factual basis for Stein's allegation that she was aggrieved on account of fraud or mistake.\n\nMcKeague noted that the lower court had acknowledged that theoretically there might be the mere \"potential\" for some sort of fraud perpetrated by a computer hacker\u2014again with no evidence.\n\nThus, McKeague continued, the TRO was granted in a \"manifest display of partiality and overreach.\" He then quoted Chief Justice John Roberts' dissent from the same-sex marriage case Obergefell v. Hodges, where Roberts wrote, \"Astounding!\" adding, \"Just who do we think we are?\"\n\nThe federal courts hearing Stein's case speculated that since Michigan courts had not ruled that candidates lack standing to assert the supposed rights of voters of another state, they would regard the allegations in this suit as claiming a personal injury sufficient for a federal court to weigh in.\n\nBut the two-judge majority on the panel hedged their ruling by adding, \"If, subsequently, the Michigan courts determine that Plaintiffs' recount is improper under Michigan state law for any reason, we expect the district court to entertain any properly filed motions to dissolve or modify its order in this case.\"\n\nSince there was a parallel lawsuit in state courts at the moment, the Michigan courts immediately responded by ruling that there is no such right under state law. So the trial court then dissolved (i.e., rescinded) the TRO, and the recount ended as quickly as it had begun.\n\nJudge Goldsmith ruled that the \"plaintiffs have not presented evidence of tampering or mistake. Instead, they present speculative claims going to the vulnerability of the voting machinery\u2014but not actual injury.\"\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by 10,704 votes in Michigan. There are no credible allegations that any sort of recount would actually reverse the outcome of the election. Even if there were, this would not confer standing on Stein to seek a recount, since she received only one percent of the vote in Michigan, so no court decision would result in her winning the state's 16 Electoral College votes.\n\nStein said that she was, instead, pursuing the recount as a form of audit so that Michigan citizens could have the satisfaction of knowing whether the election results were precisely accurate, giving them confidence in the electoral system.\n\nThat is not the role the Constitution assigns to federal courts. In Article III, the Supreme Law of Land confines the \"judicial power\" to deciding cases or controversies in which (1) the plaintiff has suffered a distinct and concrete personal injury (separate from society at large), (2) that can be fairly traced to the defendant, and (3) which the court can remedy if it grants the requested relief. Thus, the Constitution does not empower courts to indulge Stein's assertion of Michigan voters' rights; Stein can sue over some injury she has suffered that a court could fix, but not the alleged injuries of others.\n\nEven Goldsmith\u2014a judicial activist appointed by Barack Obama\u2014acknowledged this. \"A recount as an audit of the election,\" he wrote, \"has never been endorsed by any court.\"\n\nStein's lawyers say they are appealing the decision, but as of the filing of this report, no additional papers have been filed either with the trial court or the appeals court.\n\nThe case is Stein v. Bradshaw, 2:16-cv-14233 (E.D. Mich.).\n\nKen Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

CMP released a series of videos focused on these practices.\n\nIn his letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch and FBI director James Comey, Jr., Grassley wrote Tuesday:\n\nIn the summer of 2015, the Senate Judiciary Committee began an inquiry into paid fetal tissue transfers involving Planned Parenthood. The Committee has since obtained and reviewed more than 20,000 pages of information from the organizations involved, and engaged in detailed discussions with the attorneys for those organizations. The investigation has culminated in a Majority Staff Report to the Committee. That report is attached for your review.\nThe report documents the failure of the Department of Justice, across multiple administrations, to enforce the law that bans the buying or selling of human fetal tissue (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 289g-2) with even a single prosecution. It also documents substantial evidence suggesting that the specific entities involved in the recent controversy, and/or individuals employed by those entities, may have violated that law. Moreover, that evidence is contained entirely in those entities' own records, which were voluntarily provided to the Committee and are detailed in the report.var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([\"embed\"]);\n\nGrassley writes he is referring \"the paid fetal tissue practices of the following organizations\u2026to the FBI and the Department of Justice for investigation and potential prosecution,\" and names:\n\nHowever, Grassley also notes the national Planned Parenthood Federation of America appears to have \"learned that its affiliates engaging in paid fetal tissue programs were not following the policies and procedures it had put in place to ensure compliance\" with federal law.\n\nHe continues:\n\nHowever, instead of exercising its oversight procedures to bring them into compliance, it contacted the affiliates involved and then altered those oversight procedures in a manner that allowed the affiliates' conduct to continue. While the Committee does not have all the details of what transpired between the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and these affiliates, the facts uncovered raise a reasonable suspicion that these organizations, and/or individuals employed by them, may have engaged in a conspiracy to violate the fetal tissue law (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371). Therefore, I am referring the practices of these organizations, as outlined in the report, to the FBI and the Department of Justice for investigation and potential prosecution for this offense, as well.\n\n\"I don't take lightly making a criminal referral,\" Grassley said in a statement.\u00a0 \"But, the seeming disregard for the law by these entities has been fueled by decades of utter failure by the Justice Department to enforce it. And, unless there is a renewed commitment by everyone involved against commercializing the trade in aborted fetal body parts for profit, then the problem is likely to continue.\"\n\nRegarding the referral, CMP project lead David Daleiden said in a statement:\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee's report confirms that Planned Parenthood and companies like StemExpress partnered in a years-long criminal conspiracy to sell the body parts of aborted children for profit. When Planned Parenthood national became aware that their affiliates were operating their baby body part programs in violation of Planned Parenthood's own guidelines, Planned Parenthood covered up for the affiliates and deleted the guidelines. The Committee's report shows Planned Parenthood and their baby body parts business partners are totally unaccountable and must be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, and Planned Parenthood's barbaric abortion empire must no longer be subsidized by taxpayer funds.\n\n\"Planned Parenthood has claimed for more than a year that it did nothing illegal in its grotesque practice of trafficking aborted baby body parts for money,\" president of pro-life organization Lila Rose said in a statement sent to Breitbart News. \"Now, a second congressional investigation has uncovered more evidence that has led to four more Planned Parenthood affiliates and Planned Parenthood's national office being referred to federal law enforcement.\"\n\nTwo weeks ago, the House Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives referred Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast for criminal prosecution by the Texas Attorney General.\n\n\"This is not a set of isolated incidences or a few rogue employees,\" Rose said. \"The evidence shows that these crimes were coordinated at the highest levels of Planned Parenthood.\"\n\nRose also called for the elimination of the abortion chain's taxpayer funding.\n\n\"Planned Parenthood's disturbing baby harvesting practice is the direct result of abortion laws that dehumanize defenseless preborn children in the first place,\" she said. \"It should surprise no one that an industry that violently kills a million innocent children in the womb every year doesn't see the problem with tearing apart their little bodies and trafficking the parts for money.\"\n\n\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.1282052993774405, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 818, "FairnessVirtue": 8, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 10, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.4208886767699997, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 27, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161214170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.30073349633252, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.4545454545500003}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2016/12/21/texas-professor-pleads-guilty-synthetic-pot-cash-conspiracy/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3394, 3555]}}, "headline": "Texas Professor Pleads Guilty to Synthetic Pot Cash Conspiracy", "wordcount_as_scraped": 541, "date": "20161221210000", "story_content": "HOUSTON, Texas \u2013 A professor of finance at the University of Houston's Victoria Campus pleaded guilty in federal court to illegally transferring money from synthetic marijuana sales out of the country.\n\nThe professor of finance, Omar Maher Al Nasser, 37, was indicted in April along with 15 others in an alleged conspiracy to import synthetic marijuana, distribute the contraband, and transfer the proceeds of the sales out of the country, according to records obtained by Breitbart Texas from the Southern District of Texas federal court.

They were assited by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Conroe Police Department, sheriff's offices in Harris and Polk counties, Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, and the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office.\n\nOne of Al Nassar's attorney's, Todd Ward, said his client was not aware of the alleged synthetic cannabinoid conspiracy. The charge related to his involvement in that conspiracy is still pending, a Houston newspaper reported. The professor has been on leave without pay from the UH-Victoria campus since September 1.\n\nCourt records obtained by Breitbart Texas show that Al Nassar was denied bond in May because, \"There is a serious risk that the defendant will flee.\" The court order continued, \"I find that there is no condition or combination of conditions \u2026 which will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required.\" Al Nassar became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2011.\n\nAl Nassar is scheduled for a sentencing hearing on February 16, 2017, the DOJ stated.

In 2013 he was found guilty of murdering babies born alive during abortion and in the death of one of his patients.\n\nIt also challenges the narrative put forward by abortion advocates that the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in the recent Texas case of Whole Woman's Health vs. Hellerstedt prevents state legislatures from requiring health and safety standards in abortion clinics.\n\n\"This report is the tip of the iceberg as too many state officials are turning a blind eye to this red-light district of medicine,\" says AUL's vice president of legal affairs Denise Burke. \"AUL is calling on state attorneys general and governors to order inspections of abortion clinics and on state legislators to enact the enhanced protections for women and their unborn children featured in AUL's\u00a0Women's Protection Project\u00a0and\u00a0Infants' Protection Project.\"\n\nThis is a win for Texans & women across the country who need access to abortion. https://t.co/UEatutANNk #MyDecision pic.twitter.com/vWe0D8QoxU\n\u2014 Planned Parenthood (@PPact) June 27, 2016\n\n\n\n\"The abortion industry willingly sacrifices women's health and safety in their 'back alley' clinics, prioritizing mere access to abortion over women's health and safety,\" Burke, the report\u2019s author, continues, adding:\n\nConvicted murderer Kermit Gosnell provided \"mere access\" to abortion, and women died in his care. During the investigation of Gosnell and his \"house of horrors\" abortion clinic, the grand jury found that, while there were laws on the books allowing for inspections, state officials decided not to act because of abortion politics. Women's health and safety must not be held hostage by an abortion industry willing to put profit over people.\n\nWith support from Catholic publishing company Our Sunday Visitor, AUL researchers analyzed hundreds of incidents, found in official records, in which abortion providers have been investigated or cited by state officials for violations of health and safety standards and other laws pertaining to abortions. Still, however, AUL observed a similar situation that the grand jury in the Gosnell case discovered as well:\n\nImportantly, even limiting the scope of our investigation to the last eight years, efforts to discern the true state of abortion practices was stymied by a dearth of protective laws in a number of states, a lack of reporting in others, and limited public availability of information on abortion providers in still more states. We can easily deduce, there- fore, that the epidemic of substandard abortion practice is worse than even these pages show.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported in April of 2013, one month before Gosnell's conviction:\n\nAccording to the transcript of Grand Jury testimony taken on January 20, 2011, Kermit Gosnell, the abortion doctor on trial for the murder of seven babies and an adult patient, was not caught by the Pennsylvania Dept. of Health (DOH). The discovery of what has been described as a \"horror show\" was accidental, the result of a police raid to seize evidence of illegal prescription sales.\nIt was only after this raid and the resulting media publicity of what the police found at the clinic (\"the disgusting conditions, the dazed patients, the discarded fetuses\") that the DOH stepped in.\nWhat the Grand Jury testimony makes clear, though, is that very little of what was ultimately discovered could have come as a surprise to the Pennsylvania Department of Health \u2014 the government agency that should have been \"the first line of defense\" against Gosnell. The DOH had not only received numerous complaints about deaths and underage abortions over the years, but DOH personnel had also visited Gosnell's clinic on numerous occasions.\nDespite these complaints and being an eye witness to heaven knows what, no action was\u00a0ever taken.\n\nBurke says abortion supporters should read the fine print of the high court's decision of Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt.\n\n\"In the Supreme Court's June ruling\u2026the Justices indicated that health and safety standards designed to protect women from abortion industry abuses would be constitutional\u00a0if\u00a0there was better evidence of the need for such regulations,\" she asserts. \"Here's proof that women need such protections and that abortion clinics must be better regulated and regularly inspected.\"\n\nWhen TX imposes restrictions that push safe & affordable abortion care out of reach, @ReproRights & @WholeWomans are like: pic.twitter.com/JGVFZSonrz\n\u2014 All* Above All (@AllAboveAll) December 12, 2016\n\n\n\nThe report focuses on evidence collected from 32 states on hundreds of abortion clinics, both Planned Parenthood and those not affiliated with the national chain, as well as those belonging to individual abortionists.\n\n\"Unsafe is both a 'snapshot' in time, focusing only on abortion practices since 2008, and the 'tip' of the proverbial iceberg, convincingly demonstrating a nationwide pattern of abuse that characterizes an industry that fights to keep profits high and standards low,\" says the report's executive summary.\n\nThe report tells the stories of women who have been victimized by the abortion industry, including those who lost their lives after having abortions. It provides detailed analysis of hundreds of violations and substandard practices commonly found in abortion clinics, among them the failure to: provide a safe and sanitary environment for the procedure; to adequately document and protect patient records; and to properly train staff.\n\nIn addition, abortion clinics were found to use expired medications, to fail to maintain medical equipment, and to fail to monitor patient vital signs.\n\n\"Unsafe\" also reveals \"the abortion industry's reliance on a small cadre of abortion providers who travel from state to state plying their grisly trade and who are not available to women suffering post-abortive complications,\" AUL's press release notes, and adds:\n\n[A]t least 13 abortion providers either failed to report suspected sexual abuse of a minor or failed to implement practices to protect minors from ongoing sexual abuse, at least 30 abortion providers failed to provide or post all required informed consent information, and more than two dozen abortion clinics failed to comply with abortion reporting requirements.\n\n\n\nThe report features 39 Planned Parenthood clinics in 15 states (Alabama, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia).

You have a candidate who is pretty much known to have engaged in behavior that has caught the interest of the FBI, and then for the FBI to actually be investigating them \u2013 we haven't been here before, and it's very troubling,\" he said.\n\n\"What I've seen \u2013 and I always caveat and say I'm not a lawyer, which is true. What I've seen, and the people I've talked to, says that a president can pardon themselves. There's nothing in the statute that precludes them from doing it. And I think if we know anything about the Clintons, going back to the Lewinsky scandal and the impeachment, if that's what it takes, they're definitely going to do that,\" Schweizer predicted.\n\nMarlow wondered if pardoning herself might be a bit much even for Hillary Clinton, as it would probably invite impeachment proceedings.\n\n\"The question is, will Republicans \u2013 let's say Hillary wins, and let's say the Republicans lose the Senate\u2026are they going to be able to, the Democrats, be able to enforce discipline, to ensure that they don't have a majority of the Senate?\" Schweizer replied. \"I think, based on history and the way the Clintons roll, yes, they probably will.\" \n\n\"You made a great point and a very astute observation that there is a preemptive action that Barack Obama can take, that he can basically pardon her preemptively and just make this whole thing go away. He's gonna be reluctant to do that because he's very concerned about his legacy, and this would destroy a lot of his legacy \u2013 but if that's what it takes, I think he's prepared to do that,\" Schweizer said.\n\nIn addition to the renewed FBI interest in Hillary Clinton's email irregularities, Schweizer said the Clinton Foundation issue is not going away.\n\n\"Let me just say, I have it on good authority \u2013 I can't go into detail how \u2013 but I have it on good authority that this is the major vein of the Clinton investigation,\" he said. \"The emails are important. They are looking at the emails. Important issues are raised. The Clinton Foundation investigation has been longer, it's been more intense, it's involved more divisions of the FBI than has the email scandal. What the FBI does a lot of is white-collar crime investigation, and that's what's taking place right now.\"\n\n\"I think this is not going away, by any stretch of the imagination, and the question is again, let's assume for a second that Hillary does win. I think you are going to have active, open warfare between the White House and the FBI,\" he predicted. \"The FBI director \u2013 it's an independent agency \u2013 he does not answer to the president. Certainly, there are things the president can try to do to make life miserable for the FBI Director, but then it comes down to Jim Comey, and is Jim Comey gonna stand his ground and press for the investigation against major, major headwinds from the White House? This is going to be something that I think is going to be lurking with us, as a country, for quite some time.\"\n\n\"The first thing the FBI is trying to figure out is, can they find a jury somewhere that they can present a pay-to-play case to that the jury will understand and that the jury will convict based on?\" he said. \"I think there are people in the FBI that are very convinced that pay-to-play has taken place, that they were selling influence, that there were quid pro quos, but you want to make sure that you've got a case that you can go.\"\n\n\"That's the first part of it,\" he continued. \"The second part of it is how the email case collides with the Clinton Foundation investigation. Remember, Huma Abedin has these 650,000 emails, which to me is a mind-boggling number of emails, sitting on her laptop. Those were obtained by the Violent Crimes Division of the FBI, who is investigating Anthony Weiner. That's the division of the FBI that's looking into his case. The Violent Crimes division has obtained those emails, but those emails are now accessible to the white collar criminal division, which is investigating the Foundation, and the national security division, which is investigating the email case.\"\n\n\"So the other question then will be \u2026 among those 650,000 emails, are there some of Hillary's private emails, and do they offer either evidence of\u2026remember the question of intent. Comey asked if we can prove intent, that she intended to break the records laws. There may be intent in those emails \u2013 or there may be really clear-cut evidence of quid pro quos as it relates to the Clinton Foundation,\" he speculated. \"Those, to me, are the two big things that are outstanding, and I have it on pretty good authority \u2013 I can't go into detail \u2013 that the FBI is convinced that there is pay-to-play that took place, and they have some pretty good evidence of that.\"\n\nMarlow noted that the mainstream media's standard boils down to a demand for \"smoking-gun\" evidence of corruption before Clinton can be suspected of wrongdoing.\n\n\"Yeah, that's right. I mean, that's what comes out in the Podesta emails,\" Schweizer noted. \"There's more than a dozen emails about Clinton Cash, and they're spinning to the media was that because we could not prove that we had the smoking-gun evidence, there's no case here. In other words, the case begins and ends in journalism. If journalists can't prove the crime was committed, there's no reason to go further. Let's forget about the FBI looking into it. Let's forget about depositions. Let's forget about talking to witnesses. Let's forget about the entire chain of process.\"\n\n\"That's what a lot of the Podesta emails are about, on this case and others. It's all about management. It's about media management and image management. And I think that's one of the big takeaways about how the Clintons operate. They try to frame things their way, and won't step away. In the current dispute with the FBI and Jim Comey, notice they have no substance at all to say about anything related to the emails or Anthony Weiner. They're focused on framing this as all about Comey and his political motive. It's the old saying from Oscar Wilde: if you can't deal with the message, go after the messenger,\" he said.\n\n\"So that, I think, is what their strategy is. That strategy, though, has failed,\" Schweizer pronounced.\n\nMarlow saw parallels between the Democratic character assassination of Mitt Romney in 2012 and the campaign being waged against James Comey, a similarly clean-cut man who became a sinister figure overnight in Democrat mythology when he became an obstacle to Clinton's campaign.\n\n\"It's scorched earth,\" Schweizer agreed. \"And here's the thing: James Comey is head of the FBI. He's also, obviously, a lawyer. Be very clear: he has testified and communicated with Congress numerous times that the investigation was closed, because it was closed. Then you had the Anthony Weiner \u2013 he has a legal obligation to let Congress know that he needs to modify his testimony. If he fails to do that, he could have been charged with lying to Congress.\"\n\n\"He testified before Congress. He's been communicating with Congress when they released some of the FBI records, and in that communication, he repeatedly said, 'This investigation is closed' because it was closed. For him to not go back \u2013 had Congress found out later, which they would have, that the case had been reopened, regardless of how it ends up \u2013 they could have very easily said, 'You lied to Congress. You failed to tell us that there was a change in the status. We are going to charge you with lying to Congress,'\" Schweizer elaborated. \n\n\"And for somebody who is a lawyer, who operates by the books like Jim Comey, that's real legal jeopardy. So he really didn't have a choice. People who are saying that, well, he could have waited \u2013 he couldn't have waited. When you testify before Congress and you realize that either something has changed or you made an error, you better darn well correct the record before Congress finds out about it, or they are gonna bring you up on lying-before-Congress charges, which is, of course, an additional thing that Hillary Clinton is facing, as it relates to the emails,\" he pointed out.\n\nIn parting, Schweizer said, \"We probably shouldn't expect too much more from the FBI side between now and the election.\"\n\n\"I think it's gonna grind along, as these investigations do \u2013 but it's lurking, and it's big, and it's not gonna go away,\" he said.\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\u00a0to 9:00 a.m.\u00a0Eastern.\n\nListen to the full audio of Schweizer\u2019s interview above.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.95845699310303, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1515, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.04782811168, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161103030000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 9, "pct_mft_words": 1.65016501650165, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/12/08/american-dream-sliding-irs-data/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [307, 819, 824, 1495, 1607, 2816, 2843]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 701, "scraper_regex": 751}}, "headline": "IRS Data: American Dream Evaporates, Amid Mass Immigration, Automation", "wordcount_as_scraped": 751, "date": "20161209020000", "story_content": "The probability of American children earning as much as their parents has plunged from 92 percent down to 50 percent during the last seven decades, according to a new study of tax data and the shrinking American Dream of upward mobility.\u00a0\n\nCompared to people born in 1940, the \"babies born in 1980 \u2014 today's 36-year-olds \u2014 the index of the American dream has fallen to 50 percent: Only half of them make as much money as their parents did,\" says a report in the New York Times. \n\n\"In the industrial Midwestern states that effectively elected Donald Trump, the share was once higher than the national average. Now, it is a few percentage points lower. There, going backward is the norm,\" the newspaper admitted.\n\nThe study of IRS data report is here.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0The researchers suggested the generation-to-generation loss of income is caused by a rise in economic inequality.\n\n\nMost of the decline is due to the more unequal distribution of economic growth in recent decades rather than the slowdown in GDP growth. Increasing economic growth rates to the higher levels experienced in mid-century America would increase the fraction of children earning more than their parents to 62%. Spreading the existing growth more broadly across the income distribution would raise the level to 80%\n\n\nBut that claim assumes that the inequality is a cause, not just another consequence, of the economic factors that are reducing economic growth.\u00a0\n\nThe NYT report also tried to focus the blame on rising economic inequality and offered to a list of feel-good\u00a0progressive fixes that were not implemented, or did not produce beneficial impacts, during President Barack Obama\u2019s two progressive terms.\n\n\nGiven today's high-tech, globalized economy, the single best step would be to help more middle- and low-income children acquire the skills that lead to good-paying jobs. Notably, most college graduates still earn more than their parents did, other data show \u2014 yes, even after taking into account student debt.\nBut education is not the only answer. Incomes have also stagnated because of the rise of corporate power and the weakening of labor unions, leading profits to rise at the expense of wages. The decline of two-parent families plays a role, too. And tax policy has not done enough to push back against these forces: The middle class, not the affluent, deserves a tax cut.\n\n\nNeither the researchers nor the NYT's writer suggested that the federal government's policy since the 1980s of hugely inflating the labor supply amid labor-reducing automation might be contributing to rising inequality and declining salaries.\n\nUnder President Barack Obama, the federal government annually imports at least one million legal immigrants, plus almost one million temporary\u00a0white-collar guest workers\u00a0and blue-collar guest workers for jobs sought by Americans. Those two million new foreign workers \u2014 plus the roughly eight million illegal immigrants in jobs \u2014 compete against the four million young Americans who begin looking for jobs each year.\n\nThat wage-cutting competition shifts roughly $500 billion per year from wages and salaries into company profits, boosting investors and Wall Street, but reducing productivity growth and creating a huge population of unemployed men and of government-dependent poor people in the United States.\n\nIn March 2016, Donald Trump promised to protect Americans from the guest worker programs, such as the H-1B program, which outsources at least 650,000 white-collar jobs to foreign guest workers living in the United States: \u201cI will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program,\u201d he said \u201cNo exceptions.\"\n\nIn August 2016, Trump laid out his pro-American immigration policy in an Arizona speech:\n\n\nThe truth is, our immigration system is worse than anyone realizes. But the facts aren't known because the media won't report on them, the politicians won't talk about them, and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up.\nToday you will get the truth.\nThe fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful politicians. Let me tell you who it doesn't serve: it doesn't serve you, the American people.\nWhen politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following: amnesty, open borders, and lower wages.\nImmigration reform should mean something else entirely: it should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.\n\n\nRead the full text here.\n\nFollow Neil Munro on Twitter @NeilMunroDC or email the author at NMunro@Breitbart.com.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.750938653945923, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 701, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.1465578727, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 11, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161209020000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.2810271041369505, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/jerusalem/2016/12/27/netanyahu-recruiting-trump-to-thwart-last-minute-obama-bid-on-palestinian-state/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [610, 2305, 3150, 4336]}}, "headline": "Report: Netanyahu \u2018Recruiting\u2019 Trump To Thwart Another Obama Anti-Israel UN Move", "wordcount_as_scraped": 693, "date": "20161227120000", "story_content": "TEL AVIV \u2013 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday night reportedly attempted to reach out to President-elect Donald Trump and the U.S. Congress to block a potential last-minute bid by the Obama administration to have the UN Security Council approve parameters for a Palestinian state.\n\nAfter the anti-settlement resolution was passed on Friday, Netanyahu\u2019s office said he was encouraged by the incoming U.S. administration and working with Trump to \"to negate the harmful effects of this absurd resolution.\"\n\nAccording to the\u00a0Times of Israel citing Israel\u2019s Channel 2, Netanyahu told colleagues off the record, \"They are spitting at us.\"\n\n\"We will respond forcefully,\" he added.\n\nOn Sunday night Netanyahu summoned the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Dan Shapiro, asking him for an explanation as to why the Obama administration broke with decades of U.S. policy and failed to use its veto rights to shelve Resolution 2334.\n\nEarlier in the day, Netanyahu summoned 12 envoys of nations that voted in favor of the resolution, which declares settlements illegal under international law and demands that Israel immediately cease construction in eastern Jerusalem, the West Bank, and other territories captured in the 1967 defensive war.\n\nThe Jerusalem municipality, meanwhile, is slated to approve construction this week on new homes in neighborhoods captured in that war, underscoring Israel\u2019s defiance of the Security Council motion.\n\nOn Sunday, Breitbart Jerusalem reported that Netanyahu had warned his cabinet of more \u201csurprises\u201d Obama may have in store for Israel.\n\nIn a bid to thwart any diplomatic maneuvering on Obama\u2019s part, Netanyahu is reaching out to Trump as a \u201cdeterrence\u201d method, the Channel 2 report said. Netanyahu is hoping that the Trump administration will level punitive economic measures on countries that vote against Israel at the UN.\n\nTrump was reported to have been recruited to intervene after another anti-settlement resolution was presented by Egypt on Thursday. That vote was shelved at the last minute only to be brought back to the UN the next day, this time by Venezuela, New Zealand, Senegal and Malaysia.\n\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi put in a call to Trump in which they reportedly\u00a0discussed the resolution, and shortly thereafter Egypt cancelled the vote.\n\nCNN reported that an unnamed Israeli official said Israel \u201cimplored the White House not to go ahead and told them that if they did, we would have no choice but to reach out to President-elect Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did reach out to the President-elect and are deeply appreciative that he weighed in, which was not a simple thing to do,\u201d the official said.\n\nAccording to the Channel 2 report, Netanyahu is concerned that Secretary of State John Kerry will delineate parameters for a Palestinian state in a scheduled speech in the coming days. Once those parameters are outlined, the fear is that the Obama administration will attempt to have them passed as another resolution at the UNSC.\n\nFrance, whose efforts to host a peace summit were snubbed by Netanyahu, will convene with\u00a0members of the Middle East Quartet \u2014 the US, UN, Russia and EU \u2014 and Kerry on January 15. According to Israel\u2019s Channel 10, the points agreed upon at the summit may be adopted by the UNSC in the five days left of Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nOn Saturday, Netanyahu accused Obama of initiating the resolution \u201cbehind Israel\u2019s back.\u201d\n\n\"We have no doubt that the Obama administration initiated it, stood behind it, coordinated its versions and insisted upon its passage,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the resolution, which defines Jerusalem\u2019s Old City and the Western Wall \u2013 Judaism\u2019s holiest site \u2013 as \"occupied Palestinian territory,\" would make \u201cnegotiations harder and drive peace further away.\u201d\n\nTrump apparently agreed, tweeting, \u201cThe big loss yesterday for Israel in the United Nations will make it much harder to negotiate peace. Too bad, but we will get it done anyway!\u201d\n\nNetanyahu was hopeful on Saturday night that Trump would come to Israel\u2019s aid, saying, \u201cWe are entering a new era.

Gen. Robert A. Carr, a former counterintelligence official, revealed that a Pentagon task force found nearly 900 names of local Afghan nationals contained in the Manning\u2019s leaked records. Manning shared 700,000 classified documents and video with WikiLeaks, which published them without redacting names.\n\nCarr led the Pentagon\u2019s review of the fallout from the WikiLeaks disclosures.\n\nAccording to Obama administration\u00a0defense officials, American lawmakers, and former Afghan President Hamid Karzai, the former soldier endangered the lives of U.S. military informants and American troops by leaking classified U.S. military information to WikiLeaks.\n\n\u201cWe consider that extremely irresponsible and an act that one cannot overlook,\u201d Karzai said at the time, accusing WikiLeaks of placing the lives of Afghans in danger by disclosing the documents it obtained from Manning.\n\n\"In some cases, lives will be harmed,\" declared retired Gen. Carr while serving as the U.S. government's first witness in the sentencing phase of Manning's court-martial in July 2013.\n\nEchoing Carr, Rear Adm. Kevin Donegan, former operations director of U.S. Central Command (2010-2012), which covers American military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, testified that Manning has \u201d endangered Afghan villages that might be perceived as friendly toward U.S. or coalition forces.\u201d\n\nDonegan, the U.S. Army prosecutor's last witness in August 2013, went on to say that \u201cthere was absolutely an impact\u201d on the U.S. government from the leaked information.\n\nIn the wake of the leaks, Manning forced the Pentagon to set up a warning system for any Afghan or Iraqi national whose co-operation with the U.S. military may have put their life in danger.\n\nAccording to The New York Times (NYT), WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange refused to redact the names of Afghan informants mentioned in the documents leaked to the public in 2010, telling the Guardian, \"If an Afghan civilian helps coalition forces, he deserves to die.\"\n\nNYT noted that, eventually, \"computer-savvy volunteers at the [WikiLeaks] organization corrected Mr. Assange's mistake and used an inventive computer program to scrub names and identities from the second leak of documents, the Iraq War Logs.\"\n\nIn July 2010, retired Adm. Mike Mullen, then-chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters that Assange may have \"blood\" on his hands \"of some young soldier or that of an Afghan family\" after leaking the documents provided by Manning who is currently known as Chelsea.\n\nAlthough, at of the time of Manning's sentencing, there was no evidence linking the released\u00a0classified information to any fatalities, those named in the Manning documents face indefinite targeting by jihadist groups for having cooperated with American soldiers.\n\nManning was\u00a0found guilty of 20 counts affiliated with leaking classified information linked to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, including six counts under the Espionage Act, but was ultimately acquitted of the most serious charge of \u201caiding the enemy,\" which carries a sentence of life behind bars without the possibility of parole.\n\nThe former soldier\u2019s disclosure is considered to be unprecedented.\n\nCarr pointed out that the leak has damaged the relationship between the U.S. Army and the Afghan people. He also said that U.S. supply lines have been compromised because Manning divulged details of military logistics.\n\nFormer Rep. Howard \u201cBuck\u201d McKeon (R-CA), then-chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, welcomed the 35-year sentence imposed on Manning. \u201cBradley Manning endangered the security of the United States and the lives of his own comrades in uniform when he intentionally disclosed vast amounts of classified data,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Obama's decision to commute the sentence of the convicted leaker has drawn sharp rebuke from GOP leaders in Congress.\n\n\u201cThis is just outrageous.

After previously targeting gay pro-free speech Cal Poly academics,\u00a0they have now trained their sights on college President Jeffrey Armstrong.\n\nOn Monday, the Cal Poly Queer Student Union, a school-sponsored club that supposedly seeks to actively improve \"Cal Poly\u2019s campus climate for queer identified students,\" posted a photo on Facebook comparing President Armstrong's comments about the MILO event to those of Texas A&M President Michael Young, with this message:\n\n\u201cPresident Armstrong, do you really think the blending of white nationalism and lousy intellectualism should be apart [sic] of the \"global marketplace\"? We think not.\u201d\n\nThe post first quotes President Armstrong's response to calls for the cancellation of the MILO event:\n\n\nCal Poly's campus is an open environment where opinions, ideas and thoughts are freely shared\u2014even those that some may find distasteful and offensive. Censoring viewpoints that we don't agree with violates free speech and does not represent what we stand for as a university. Rather, free speech and the open exchange of ideas and opinions\u2014even those that conflict with our own\u2014is an important part of student growth and preparation for success in today's global marketplace.\n\n\nThis quote is juxtaposed with President Young's words about a completely different speaker, the self-proclaimed alt-right leader Richard Spencer, who recently spoke at Texas A&M.\n\nSpencer, part of the hardline racist wing of the alt-right, shares little in common with MILO, who has had no involvement with the movement beyond reporting on it. Yet progressives and the mainstream media insists on linking MILO to the movement, in an attempt to discredit him and smear him as a racist.\n\n\nI find the views of the organizer\u2014and the speaker he is apparently sponsoring\u2014abhorrent and profoundly antithetical to everything I believe. In my judgement, those views simply have no place in civilized dialogue and conversation\u2026Outrage and indignation are emotions understandably running high; I share these sentiments. At the same time, I am also truly heartened by the clear message that the Aggie community is sending in reaction to their intrusion\u2014the firm resolve to speak up in opposition to these views, the resounding affirmation that they do not represent the Aggie values we espouse and to which we aspire, and the call to action to reject these views\u2026\n\n\nThe latter quote shows clear pandering to progressive sensitivities on campus. It also seems to suggest that, unlike Cal Poly, A&M's chief prioritizes \"Aggie values\" over the right to free speech, but that's not entirely true.\n\nAs one skeptical commenter pointed out, a very important line was omitted from the quote, hence the dot-dot-dot. In the same address, Young also stated:\n\n\n[B]arring a breach of contract and/or unresolvable safety concerns, we have no plans to prohibit the speaker from using the room he has rented. Freedom of speech is a First Amendment right and a core value of this university, no matter how odious the views may be.\n\n\nOnce again, progressives have been caught ignoring reality out of political convenience.\n\nArmstrong's unwillingness to cave to progressive demands have made him a sworn enemy of leftist groups like the Cal Poly Queer Student Union and SLO Solidarity, whose members and supporters have previously called for him to resign.\n\nIn a comment, MILO said:\n\n\u201cI welcome President Armstrong\u2019s clear defence of free speech on campus. It\u2019s a decision that\u2019ll bring him some trouble in the short term, but in the long term will pay huge dividends for his college\u2019s reputation.

She outlined her plan for architectural changes to the internal layout of mosques, so as to include men and women side by side in prayer.\n\n\"Islam does not forbid them to mix,\" Sa'eed said, noting that the Haj (pilgrimage to Mecca) is mixed as are prayers at the Mecca compound.\n\nMuslims are distinguished by loudness and disorder, and men and women are not accustomed to gathering together in places of worship. Sadly, most Muslims\u2019 perception of women is fanatical and sexualized, far removed from spirituality and rationality. Hence, building mosques of the type [I propose, and having men and women] meet each other in a spiritual environment on a regular basis, will improve the relationship between the sexes and will have a positive cultural impact on society as a whole.\nThe main goal we should pursue is to enlighten society by studying Islam from a cultural perspective that fosters equality and mutual respect between men and women instead of segregating them as though they come from two different planets. Let\u2019s make mosques similar to churches!\n\nHer description of an ideal mosque does not, however, have women and men sitting together. Instead, Sa'eed envisions a seating area divided into two sections for women and men, and a separate platform divided into two areas for prayers. Sa'eed would also like to see the introduction of dim lighting \"to create an atmosphere of spirituality and inner calm.\"\n\nAsked whether Muslims would take issue with the idea of chairs in a mosque, Sa'eed answers:\n\nEverything is difficult at first, but I do not understand why Islamists and conservatives should object to seats in mosques when they do not object to the construction of Western-style skyscrapers around the [Grand] Mosque compound in Mecca. \u2026 It is unreasonable to object to having seats in a mosque [just] to avoid any resemblance to a church. After all, most moderate clerics preach tolerance and rapprochement between the religions, so why shouldn\u2019t a mosque resemble a church? Everyone [on earth] sits on chairs, and I have never heard that sitting on a chair is forbidden or reprehensible.\n\n\"Getting used to sitting in chairs in an orderly manner and praying in soft voices under dim lighting will gradually refine Muslim behavior,\u201d she adds.\n\nWhile Sa'eed doesn't think the Arab world is ready yet for female imams \u2013 as has happened in Europe \u2013 she believes that women should start taking on official roles in Islamic jurisprudence, and Muslim societies should be open to publishing religious books by women and airing religious television programs presented by women.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 507, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.5427784316799997, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 14, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 4, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161204020000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.7613412228796803, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.2727272727299999}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2016/12/13/dea-224-mexican-cartel-tunnels-found-since-1990/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [594]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 518, "scraper_regex": 555}}, "headline": "DEA: 224 Mexican Cartel Border Tunnels Found Since 1990", "wordcount_as_scraped": 555, "date": "20161213200000", "story_content": "U.S. authorities have uncovered and destroyed 224 tunnels used to smuggle bulk quantities of illicit drugs along the U.S.-Mexico border since 1990\u2013including 22 discovered in the last two years alone\u2013reports the DEA in its latest National Drug Threat Assessment.\n\nAccording to the threat assessment report, not all drug trafficking tunnels throughout the southwest cross into the United States.\n\nOf the 224 tunnels discovered along the southwest border (SWB) between 1990 and March 2016, 185 crossed into the U.S.\n\nThe report notes that the\u00a0tunnels have primarily been discovered in Arizona and California and are commonly used by the Sinaloa Cartel, one of the oldest and most established drug trafficking groups with \"the most expansive international footprint amongst Mexican cartels.\"\n\nIn 2013, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) determined that tunnels along the southwest border are \u201ca significant and growing threat to border security.\u201d\n\nThe DEA points out tunnels tend to originate in Mexico and lead to a stash house on the U.S. side of the border.\n\n\"These tunnels typically have entrances in discreet places, such as private residences or warehouses, to avoid law enforcement suspicion,\" it adds.\n\nThe assessment notes that Mexican cartels, officially known as Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCO), maintain control of lucrative smuggling routes into the United States used to traffic \"multi-ton quantities\" of illegal drugs on an annual basis, primarily heroin, which has been responsible for an unprecedented number of U.S. overdose deaths in recent years.\n\nA map included in the report shows that Mexican TCOs, primarily the Sinaloa cartel, maintain influence across the United States, with hubs in nearly every single state in the country.\n\nIn its threat assessment report, the DEA explains:\n\nThe poly-drug portfolio maintained by these Mexican TCOs consists primarily of heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, marijuana, and, to a lesser extent, fentanyl.\nOnce these drugs are smuggled across the Mexican border, they are delivered to consumer markets in the United States using transportation routes and distribution cells that Mexican TCOs oversee both directly and indirectly.

Gen. Kenneth Tovo, former deputy commander of U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), estimated in March 2015 that illegal drug trafficking in the region generates at least \"tens of millions\" for Hezbollah.\n\nThe congressional task force reports:\n\nBased in Lebanon, the Shiite Muslim terror group Hezbollah has been linked with South American drug trafficking organizations operating out of the tri-border [Paraguay, Argentina, Brazil] region.

Of these, the largest number (21 percent) are from Nigeria, lured into making the dangerous journey by a vigorous promotion campaign promising benefits and opportunities, as well as a free shuttle service provided by the Italian Coast Guard and a number of NGOs.\n\nWhile most of the African migrants arriving in Italy are young men, a much higher percentage of the Nigerians are women. Currently, one out of every two prostitutes in Italy is Nigerian.\n\nArinze Orakwe, an official of the Nigerian anti-trafficking organization NAPTIP, fighting against the traffickers is an uphill battle, in part because of public opinion and propaganda about life in Europe. \"Everyone thinks that the streets of Europe are paved with gold,\" he said.\n\nThe human traffickers organizing the exodus from Africa into Italy include bands of Nigerian mafia gangs who force unsuspecting migrants into working for them as street beggars or prostitutes once they arrive in Italy.\n\nOne 24-year-old Nigerian woman named Gloria Erobaga recounted the harrowing experience of forced prostitution on Italian streets, after she had been promised \"honest work\" by the mafia traffickers who arranged her passage to Italy.\n\n\"They would continually check up on us to collect our money and they killed the girls who didn't pay,\" she said. \"I know of Nigerian women in Italy who were killed, cut up and thrown into black garbage bags, like trash,\" she added.\n\nAccording to reports in the Italian media, \"Nigerian traffickers are exploiting Europe's migrant crisis to take girls to Libya and then across the Mediterranean into Italy.\" In the past two years more than 12,000 girls and young women have arrived in Italy\u2014six times as many as in the preceding two years. Of these, four out of five have wound up in prostitution.\n\nBefore organizing their journey through Libyan contacts, traffickers have the girls sign a contract to finance their trip, imposing debts of up to $30,000, which can only be paid back after years of working.\n\nMany of the young women are taken to a priest of Voodoo, who conducts rituals called juju that supposedly bind them spiritually to their traffickers and insure the payment of the debt. These rites instill terror in their victims, convinced that they or their loved ones could fall ill or die if they were to disobey the traffickers, go to the police or fail to pay their debts.\n\nOnce in Italy, the women are placed together in common dwellings and given a \"madam\" to coordinate their work as prostitutes.\n\nFabio Sorgoni, an official with a charity that helps prostitutes in Italy, said Italian men are attracted by the youth and low price of the women and often don't realize they are sex slaves.\n\nAppealing to men who pay Nigerians for sex, Sorgoni said: \"If you go to a prostitute, try to understand if they are a minor and whether they are doing this work of their own free will.\"\n\nMeanwhile, African immigrants continue to stream into Italy by the hundreds and thousands every day. They are usually picked up several miles off the coast of Libya by waiting \"rescue\" vessels of the Italian Coast Guard or a number of organizations that assist migrants, who then take them across the Strait of Sicily to Italian ports.\n\nWhat many well-meaning NGOs and pro-immigration groups don't realize, is that by assisting migrants in their passage from North Africa to Italy, they are also abetting organized crime and condemning thousands of women to forced prostitution.\n\nAnna, a woman forced into prostitution after being told by traffickers she would pick fruit in Italy, wishes she had never made it here.\n\n\"My message to girls back in Nigeria is, 'Don't come,'\" she said.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

The exercise, successful or not, is part of a professional discussion, mounted on an internal wall on the steps of the academy, and is not displayed in a public way.

The number of Palestinians killed is estimated to be 46,000, less than half of Montasser's figure of at least 100,000 Jewish deaths.\n\nThe \"tiny minority\" of Jews, writes Montasser, \"managed to dominate 50% of the media, and constituted 70% of the judges.\"\n\n\"They forced their presence upon the media, and in film, theater and literature. They were granted excessive dominance and promotion. While gaining this dominance they brought about most of the bank collapses between 1870 and 1920.\"\n\nMontasser continues, \"They caused many financial collapses, and this is not Nazi propaganda. The Jews themselves admitted it. During this period millions of German households lost their livelihood, their savings and their investment options because of the Jewish banking gangs.\"\n\nMontasser also blames\u00a0the Jews for impacting German psychology, which he calls \"the most dangerous factor.\"\n\nThis included introducing pornography and homosexuality into German culture and spreading prostitution and \"every kind of sexual obsession and decadent art. This is a silly kind of art, now called modern art, and it was all spread and promoted by the Jews. This caused anger and outrage among German society.\"\n\nMontasser's article drew sharp critiques from other figures in Egyptian media. Dr Abd Al-Mun\u2019im Sa\u2019id published a follow-up article in which he took Montasser to task for justifying what Hitler did to the Jews and reviving racist myths. Sa'id describes Montasser as a \"friend who always stood beside me in times of need\" and calls him\u00a0a \"liberal and a reformist.\" As such, writes Sa'id, Montasser's lumping of an entire group into one \"monolithic unit\u00a0\u2026 saying \u2018the Jews said this\u2019 or \u2018the Jews did that\u2019 contravenes the recognition that human societies contain all sorts of people.\" It is impossible to draw a comparison between Albert Einstein and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, writes Sa'id.\n\nSa'id also deconstructs Montasser's numbers argument, stating that the six million Jews does not refer only to German Jews, but includes all Jews in European countries occupied by the Nazis.\n\nDr. Osama Al-Ghazali Harb, another journalist and chairman of the board of Free Egyptians, Egypt's largest political party, wrote another response article, saying he was \"shocked\" by Montasser's claims, and fearful of the reactions they could spark among Egyptian society. He thanked Sa'id for subsequently \"putting things in their rightful place.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.2453470230102495, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 517, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.19226154987, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 9, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161217130000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.7408123791102499, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.8181818181820001}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/12/25/25-dec-16-world-view-tunisia-fears-terrorism-berlin-attack-tunisian-national/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 784, "scraper_regex": 864}}, "headline": "World View: Bartella, Iraq Celebrates Christmas After Islamic State Liberation", "wordcount_as_scraped": 864, "date": "20161225170000", "story_content": "This morning\u2019s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com\n\nBartella Iraq celebrates Christmas after liberation from ISIS\n\n\nChristmas eve mass held in Bartella on Saturday (Agora Magazine)\n\nChristians from around the region are flocking to Bartella, Iraq, to join in the celebration of Christmas, the first since Bartella was liberated.\n\nBartella, just 24 km from Mosul, used to be home to thousands of Assyrian Christians.

He had a criminal record in Italy and Tunisia, and spent four years in an Italian prison before traveling to Germany.\n\nTunisian authorities have arrested three people on suspicion of being part of a \u201cterrorist cell\u2026 connected to the terrorist Anis Amri.\u201d Two of the three were arrested in the capital city Tunis.\n\nThe third arrest was Amri\u2019s own 18-year-old nephew, Fedi, his sister\u2019s son, arrested in Amri\u2019s home town of Oueslatia. During initial questioning, Fedi said that he had been in contact with uncle Anis through the mobile app Telegram, which provides for encrypted communications that can\u2019t be traced. He also said that uncle Anis had sent him money to come to Germany, and asked him to pledge allegiance to ISIS. Sky News and AP\n\nRelated Articles\n\nHundreds of Tunisians rally against jihadism at Bardo Museum in Tunis\n\nHundreds of people rallied at the Bardo Museum in Tunis, Tunisia\u2019s capital city, on Saturday, protesting the lack of government action to prevent jihadists who fought overseas from returning to the country without facing punishment.\n\nThe news that Anis Amri, a Tunisian, was the perpetrator of last week\u2019s terror act in Berlin has embarrassed and infuriated the Tunisian people.\n\nTunisians are proud that their country launched the \u201cArab Spring\u201d that began in 2011, and the resulting transition of power was largely peaceful. The Arab Spring uprisings were triggered on December 17, 2010, when a street vendor, Mohamed Bouazizi set fire to himself in Sidi Bouzid in central Tunisia, in protest of the police confiscation of his vegetable cart. After days of clashes between protesters and the police, long-time dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was forced to flee the country to exile in Saudi Arabia.\n\nHowever, that peaceful transition has come at a price. Since its 2011 revolution, Tunisia has faced repeated jihadist attacks, killing more than 100 soldiers and policemen, as well as about 20 civilians and 59 foreign tourists, according to official figures.\n\nIn March of last year, two terrorist gunmen infiltrated security at the well-known Bardo Museum in Tunis, right next door to the parliament building. They took and killed 22 hostages, with 50 people injured. Almost all of the casualties were foreign tourists.\n\nTunisians were still in shock from that attack, when another attack occurred in June. A gunman disguised as a tourist opened fire at a Tunisian hotel in Sousse on Friday, killing 37 people.\n\nPerhaps the most significant fact about Tunisia is that it\u2019s been the number one source of foreign fighters who have gone to Syria to join ISIS. Some 5,500 Tunisian citizens have left the country and are now fighting in Syria, Iraq, Libya, and to a lesser extent Mali, far more than the citizens of any other country.\n\nIt\u2019s believed that about 800 of these jihadists have returned to Tunisia in the last year. It\u2019s always been feared that Tunisian nationals returning would form terror cells in Tunisia and conduct more terror attacks, like the ones that have occurred frequently since 2011, but the actions of a Tunisian national in the Berlin attack has heightened those fears and created new anxieties. In fact, with ISIS losing territory in Syria, Iraq and Libya, it\u2019s feared that these jihadists are going to be flooding back into the country.\n\nThe purpose of Saturday\u2019s rally was to demand that further action be taken. In particular, they demanded that the government to bring home all Tunisian nationals living abroad who have links to extremist organizations, so they could face trial in their home country.

The Daily Mail reports\u00a0that the CEO of Snopes, David Mikkelson, is currently embroiled in a vicious legal battle with his former wife and Snopes co-founder Barbara Mikkelson. The couple divorced sometime around 2014, but legal proceedings have continued between the couple.\n\nBarbara has claimed that her former husband embezzled money from the company. Court documents obtained by the Daily Mail state that Barbara accused David of \"raiding the corporate business Bardav bank account for his personal use and attorney fees.\" Barbara also claims that David embezzled $98,000 over four years, which \u201che expended upon himself and the prostitutes he hired.\" Barbara claims that David spent $10,000 from their business accounts between April and June of 2016 to fund an expensive 24-day holiday for him and his \u201cgirlfriend.\u201d\n\nIn a court filing from June, Barbara claims that David has \u201cbeen depleting the corporate account by spending monies from it on his personal expenses,\" and that David's access to account debit cards and cheque books must immediately be revoked \"right away before there are no funds left in the corporate account.\"\n\nAnother point of contention during proceedings was David's salary. David demanded that his salary be increased from $240,000 a year to $360,000, a sum that David agreed he would settle for, but believed was below \"industry standards.\" He argued that he should be making up to $720,000 a year. \"As I said, based on industry standards and our revenues, my salary should be about 2x to 3x what it is now,\" David wrote in an email to Barbara in April of 2016. \"I\u2019ll settle for $360K with the understanding that it's to be retroactive to the start of the year.\" Barbara disputed David's request, stating that it was \"not even in the galaxy of reasonable.\"\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, David has remarried since his divorce from Barbara in 2014. His current wife, Elyssa Young, works as an administrative worker at Snopes, but she previously had a lengthy career as an escort and adult film star working under\u00a0the name Erin O\u2019Bryn. Reviews for Young's \"services\" have been left on her personal escort website as recently as 2015. Young's websites and Twitter account describe her as \"a mature and experienced courtesan, idealist, activist & dreamer.\" Her website further states, \"Here\u2019s the donation I request for my time, companionship, and entertainment\" with \"non-negotiable\" rates of $1,200 for her minimum four hours and $5,000 for 24 hours.\n\nMikkelson has previously stated that Snopes does not take any political positions whatsoever. His current wife, however, has a history in politics. The Daily Mail reports that Young ran for the U.S. Congress in Hawaii on the Libertarian ticket\u00a0in 2004, during which time she distributed cards that\u00a0read \"Re-Defeat Bush\" and condoms with the words \"Don't Get Screwed Again\" printed on the wrapping. On her campaign website, Young outright stated, \"Let\u2019s face it, I am an unlikely candidate. I fully admit that I am a courtesan.\" Young's campaign however was unsuccessful, and she lost to Democratic incumbent Neil Abercrombie. \n\nSpeaking to the Daily Mail, David Mikkelson stated that Snopes did not have a \"standardized procedure\" for fact-checking \"since the nature of this material can vary widely.\" He also stated that the process \"involves multiple stages of editorial oversight, so no output is the result of a single person's discretion.\" When asked about the requirements for becoming an employee at Snopes, Mikkelson stated, \u201cAccordingly, our editorial staff is drawn from diverse backgrounds; some of them have degrees and/or professional experience in journalism, and some of them don\u2019t.\"\n\nAlso according to the Daily Mail, another one of Snopes\u2019 lead fact-checkers has a history of sex blogging. Writing under the pseudonym Vice Vixen, Snopes fact-checker Kim LaCapria regularly wrote about sex and fetish gear on her own blog, which was described as a lifestyle blog \u201cwith a specific focus on naughtiness, sin, carnal pursuits, and general hedonism and bonne vivante-ery.\u201d LaCapria\u2019s blog often featured reviews of sex toys. One particular review reads, \u201cIf you are doing something to your fella, and you apply this to the base of his cash-and-prizes while you carry on, he will scream and perhaps cry.\u201d On another blog, LaCapria once\u00a0described what she did on her day off,\u00a0writing\u00a0that she \u201cplayed scrabble, smoked pot, and posted to Snopes.\u201d She then\u00a0added, \u201cThat\u2019s what I did on my day \u2018on,\u2019 too.\u201d\n\nFacebook has not yet stated when Snopes will be beginning their \u201cfake news\u201d flagging operations on the Facebook platform.

As the agents responded to the area, they observed the truck entering Interstate 8. A short pursuit ended as the driver crashed the pickup truck into a drainage ditch, according to information provided to Breitbart Texas by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials on Friday.\n\nThe incident, which occurred at about 5:30 on Thursday evening, could have been very dangerous as the bed of the pickup truck was packed with illegal aliens. The human cargo was packed in the bed of the truck under a large sheet of plywood, officials stated. None of the passengers were injured.\n\nIn addition to those packed like sardines in the bed of the pickup, other's being smuggled were stashed in the cabin of the truck. The driver and one of the passengers were identified as being involved in the smuggling operation and were arrested. All 19 people in the truck were identified as Mexican nationals.

The 31-year-old Mexican national was deported after serving a 70-month federal prison sentence after he attempted to run over a Border Patrol agent during a 2008 human smuggling attempt. He was arrested and faces new charges of human smuggling and illegal re-entry after being formally removed as a convicted felon.\n\nHis alleged co-conspirator in this human smuggling attempt, a 29-year-old Mexican national, was also arrested and faces possible federal charges for human smuggling.\n\nThe pickup truck was seized by federal officials. The 17 Mexican nationals who were being smuggled will be processed for removal.\n\nBorder Patrol officials stated they believe this smuggling incident is connected to Tomas Lara-Sanchez. He is believed to head up a transnational criminal organization that allegedly conducts smuggling operations primarily in East County, officials stated.\n\nCBP reported that the Tomas Lara-Sanchez criminal organization is believed to have been involved in a triple-smuggling event reported by Breitbart Texas earlier this week. The officials referred to the shipment of \"human contraband\" as a \"triple incursion\" across the Mexican border near Boulevard, California.\n\nThe Boulevard Station agents used a \"vehicle immobilization device\" to stop the lead vehicle. The driver of the white Toyota Sequoia stopped, but the other two vehicles fled from the scene. After a short pursuit where the other two drivers attempted to return to Mexico, Border Patrol agents were able to safely stop the fleeing vehicles.\n\nThe agents seized the three vehicles. The agents also apprehended a total of 25 people from the three vehicles. Five additional people successfully evaded the agents and absconded back to Mexico. The drivers could face possible prosecution on charges related to human smuggling.\n\nLara-Sanchez' face now appears on wanted posters in the area under a CBP most wanted suspected smugglers program called \"Se Busca Informaci\u00f3n.\" The program utilizes flyers and billboards that display the faces of some of the most notorious suspected human smugglers in the various Border Patrol sectors where the program has been implemented.\n\nBob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

Japan has demanded the return of their Northern Territories, consisting of four islands that the Soviet Union forces seized at the end of the war. Russia calls them the Kuril Islands.\n\nSo when Russia\u2019s president Vladimir Putin came to Tokyo for the last two days to visit with Japan\u2019s president Shinzo Abe, a lot of people were hoping they\u2019d reach an agreement on the disputed islands, and that they would sign an agreement ending World War II.\n\nUnfortunately, no such agreement and no peace treaty were forthcoming. Press reports seem to imply that Abe had hoped to develop a personal relationship with Putin and perhaps charm him into reaching an agreement on the islands. As it turned out, even that goal might not have been reached, as the two leaders met only briefly. Afterwards, Putin said, \u201cIt would be naive to think we can solve this problem in an hour, but there is no doubt that we need to look for a solution.\u201d Abe said, \u201cWe need to work toward a breakthrough so that we don't disappoint the next generation.\u201d\n\nInstead, they signed economic deals whose net effect will be Japanese investments in projects in Russia. Russia and Japan will each put $500 million into a new fund that will make investments in Russia\u2019s energy, urban planning and medical services. There were reports of agreements on joint Russian-Japanese economic activities on the islands, including fisheries, tourism, culture and medicine, but no talk of sovereignty.\n\nStill, while Russian analysts are saying that Russia got the better of Japan in the summit, they hope that the joint economic activities will lead to an eventual peace treaty.\n\nRussia achieved something else significant. Japan has supported the US-led economic sanctions on Russia for invading and annexing Ukraine\u2019s Crimea peninsula, and Friday\u2019s economic agreements seem to\n\nOne might well ask oneself why Japan seems so eager to suck up to Russia without seeming to get much in return. China has been increasingly hostile to Japan, while Russia and China appear to be getting along, even militarily, so perhaps Abe felt that a friendship with Russia would protect Japan from China in the future.\n\nGenerational Dynamics predicts that in the coming Clash of Civilizations world war, the US, Japan, India, Iran and Russia will be allied again China, Pakistan and the Sunni Muslim countries.

Park\u2019s fate will depend on a ruling by the Constitutional Court, which is expected early next year.\n\nIt is expected that there will be large crowds of protesters in Seoul on Saturday, calling for Park to resign from office without waiting for the Constitutional Court.

The Pakistani newspaper\u00a0Dawn reports\u00a0that witnesses had claimed to hear official announcements from their local mosques in\u00a0Kot Radha Kishan, where the incident occurred, demanding they \u201cgather at the Yousaf brick kiln where 25-year-old Shama and her husband Shahzad Masih worked as bonded labourers.\u201d\n\n\"The five people awarded the death sentence were involved in dragging, beating and burning the couple while the other eight played a supportive role according to the judgement,\" Masih family attorney Riaz Anjum told the Agence France-Presse.\n\nIn addition to torturing and killing the couple,\u00a0Dawn cites witnesses stating that the Muslim mob \u201cheld hostage five policemen who tried to rescue the couple\u201d and \u201cmanhandled\u201d journalists trying to document the event. Witnesses reported chants of \u201cAllahu akbar\" and \"kill the infidel Christians\u201d as they tortured and killed the couple.\n\nMasih and Bibi had three children, and Bibi was reportedly pregnant at the time of her death.\n\nWhile the government eventually processed 103 people in relation to the case, and the AFP puts the number of participants at \u201chundreds,\u201d Dawn\u00a0estimates that number at \u201cover 1,000.\u201d The British Pakistani Christian Association (BPCA) estimates that 3,000 people participated in the lynching. Anjum notes that 90 people of the 103 involved in the incident were acquitted.\n\nAmong those released was\u00a0Yousaf Gujjar, the owner of the brick kiln in which the couple worked. Some witnesses had alleged that Gujjar was concerned the illiterate, impoverished couple would flee the job despite their substantial debt to him, and speculated that he had planted the Quran pages in their home furnace, knowing they would be unable to identify them as such.\n\nThe BPCA, which has aided the couple\u2019s surviving children financially since the incident occurred, notes that those who have spoken to them say the couple had pleaded with Gujjar to allow them to flee following the blasphemy accusation. Instead of helping them leave, Gujjar reportedly \u201clocked the couple in a store room on his land after they asked to leave his kiln slave camp, to flee a potential mob attack.\u201d\n\nThe couple\u2019s family issued a statement through the BPCA, noting that they were \u201cunable today to attend the court today due to the risk to our safety\u201d and found the five death sentences amid a crowd of thousands disappointing. Even more worrisome, the sentences have resulted in renewed calls from Muslims for attacks on the family.\n\n\u201cWe are now starting to receive death threats from all the families of those accused and fear for our lives. This small justice could still end up costing us even more,\u201d Shama\u2019s father said.\n\nPakistan\u2019s record with handling Muslim mob violence provides little reason to hope that the family will be safe from retaliation.\u00a0Blasphemy against Islam\u00a0is a crime in Pakistan, with blasphemy directed at Muhammad in particular punishable by death. More alarming, however, is the vigilante justice by Muslim mobs that law enforcement does little to curb. In October, Pakistani officials addressed violence against Christians by ordering that house churches shut down, lest they incur the wrath of local mobs. That latest directive followed repeated calls for the death penalty against Christians accused of blasphemy, including a 16-year-old boy.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -9.453471183776859, "HarmVice": 9, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 628, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.6967994498500003, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161124170000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.0, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.5031847133758, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/12/21/timeline-germanys-two-years-islamist-terror-migrant-crisis/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1989, 3868, 4162, 4231], "\u00fc": [2832, 3094]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 631, "scraper_regex": 681}}, "headline": "Timeline: Germany's Two Years of Islamist Terror and Migrant Crisis", "wordcount_as_scraped": 681, "date": "20161221190000", "story_content": "This week, Germany experienced its worst terror atrocity since the 1980s, following 21 months of Islamist suicide bombings, shootings, axe attacks, and now a truck rampage.\n\nThe terrorist killers responsible have included numerous \u201crefugees\u201d from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Algeria, as well as several German citizens of Turkish decent indoctrinated in radical Islam.

(AP) \u2014 Jill Stein\u2019s bid to recount votes in Pennsylvania was in trouble even before a federal judge shot it down Dec. 12. That\u2019s because the Green Party candidate\u2019s effort stood little chance of detecting potential fraud or error in the vote \u2014 there was basically nothing to recount.\n\nPennsylvania is one of 11 states where the majority of voters use antiquated machines that store votes electronically, without printed ballots or other paper-based backups that could be used to double-check the balloting. There\u2019s almost no way to know if they\u2019ve accurately recorded individual votes \u2014 or if anyone tampered with the count.\n\nMore than 80 percent of Pennsylvanians who voted Nov. 8 cast their ballots on such machines, according to VotePA, a nonprofit seeking their replacement. VotePA\u2019s Marybeth Kuznik described the proposed recount this way: \u201cYou go to the computer and you say, \u2018OK, computer, you counted this a week-and-a-half ago. Were you right the first time?'\u201d\n\nThese paperless digital voting machines, used by roughly 1 in 5 U.S. voters last month, present one of the most glaring dangers to the security of the rickety, underfunded U.S. election system. Like many electronic voting machines, they are vulnerable to hacking. But other machines typically leave a paper trail that could be manually checked. The paperless digital machines open the door to potential election rigging that might not ever be detected.\n\nTheir prevalence also magnifies other risks in the election system, simply because error or fraud is harder to catch when vote counts can\u2019t be verified. And like other voting machines adopted since the 2000 election, the paperless systems are nearing the end of their useful life \u2014 yet there is no comprehensive plan to replace them.\n\n\u201cIf I were going to hack this election, I would go for the paperless machines because they are so hard to check,\u201d said Barbara Simons, the co-author of \u201cBroken Ballots,\u201d a study of flawed U.S. voting technology.\n\nStein described her recount effort as a way to ensure that the 2016 election wasn\u2019t tainted by hacking or fraud. There\u2019s no evidence of either so far \u2014 a fact federal judge Paul Diamond cited prominently in his decision halting the Pennsylvania recount .\n\nStein pursued similar recounts in Wisconsin and Michigan, to little avail. Those states use more reliable paper-based voting technologies. (The Electoral College certified Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory last week.)\n\nBut a cadre of computer scientists from major universities backed Stein\u2019s recounts to underscore the vulnerability of U.S. elections. These researchers have successfully hacked e-voting machines for more than a decade in tests commissioned by New York, California, Ohio and other states.\n\nStein and her witnesses said worries about fraud were justified given U.S. charges that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential campaign. Emails of top Democrats were hacked and leaked. Over the summer, hackers also tried to breach the voter registration databases of Arizona and Illinois using Russia-based servers, U.S. officials said. Election networks in at least 20 states were probed for vulnerabilities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a target-rich environment,\u201d said Rice University computer scientist Dan Wallach. Researchers would like to see the U.S. move entirely to computer-scannable paper ballots, because paper can\u2019t be hacked.\n\nThe U.S. voting system \u2014 a loosely regulated, locally managed patchwork of more than 3,000 jurisdictions overseen by the states \u2014 employs more than two dozen types of machinery from 15 manufacturers. Elections officials across the nation say they take great care to secure their machines from tampering. They are locked away when not in use and sealed to prevent tampering.\n\nAll of that makes national elections very difficult to steal without getting caught.\n\nBut difficult is not impossible. Wallach and his colleagues believe a crafty team of pros could strike surgically, focusing on select counties in a few battleground states where \u201ca small nudge might be decisive,\u201d he said.\n\nMost voting machines in the U.S. are at or near the end of their expected lifespans . Forty-three states use machines more than a decade old. Most run on vintage operating systems such as Windows 2000 that pre-date the iPhone and are no longer updated with security patches.\n\nOn Nov. 8, election officials across the U.S. handled numerous complaints of aging touchscreens losing calibration and casting votes for the wrong candidate.\n\nBut while many experts agree the U.S. voting system needs an upgrade, no one wants to pay to fix it.\n\nMoney flowed after the 2000 Florida recount debacle, when punch-card technology was discredited by hanging chads. Congress appropriated $4 billion for election upgrades; states raced to replace punch cards and lever machines with digital technology.\n\nBut when that money ran out, so did the ability of many states to address security concerns overlooked in their initial rush. Four in 5 U.S. election officials polled by New York University\u2019s Brennan Center last year said they are desperate to replace equipment but lack the cash.\n\nVoters in poorer areas suffer disproportionately, the center found. Data collected in Virginia, Ohio, Minnesota and Colorado suggests the poor are more apt to encounter failing machines.\n\nIn Virginia, wealthier counties near Washington have upgraded technology while lower-income counties in the state\u2019s southwest have not been able to afford it, said Edgardo Cortes, the state elections commissioner.\n\n____\n\nBajak reported from Houston.

However, China has not yet returned the drone, and says only that it will return the drone \u201cin an appropriate manner\u201d at an unnamed time.\n\nThe Pentagon says that on Thursday, a Chinese naval ship approached the USNS Bowditch, an oceanographic survey vessel with a mostly civilian crew, which was trying to retrieve an American military drone that had been collecting unclassified data for oceanic research. A Chinese warship, a \u201csubmarine rescue vessel,\u201d that had been following the Bowditch sent out a small boat and outran the Bowditch to capture the drone.\n\nAccording to the US Defense Department, China intentionally captured a \u201csovereign immune vessel,\u201d which is an act of war. The Chinese rushed to provide a laughable excuse, saying that the drone was captured \u201cin order to prevent the device from causing harm to the safety of navigation and personnel of passing vessels.\u201d\n\nThe drone was captured in waters near the Philippines, far from China. China has declared its intention to annex the entire South China Sea as its sovereign territory, even though its claims have been shown to be a hoax, and even though a judgment by the United Nations Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in the Hague has made it clear that China was violating international law.\n\nChinese state media made it clear that the seizure was intentional. It quotes Li Jie, a Beijing-based naval expert:\n\nThis is not the first time that we seized a US underwater drone in the South China Sea, but the one we seized on Thursday is new and more advanced than before and might carry valuable information just gathered in the South China Sea.\n\nAccording to one theory, China seized the US military drone to send a threatening message to US president-elect Donald Trump, after he accepted a phone call from Taiwan\u2019s president Tsai Ing-wen on December 2. Trump has indicated that he is also reviewing America\u2019s support for the \u201cone China\u201d policy, which says that Taiwan is a province of China.\n\nChina was forced to back down and promise to return the drone because not doing so could force a military response by the US. However, until China fulfills its promise and actually returns the drone, a military response remains a possibility. Washington Post and Xinhua and Global Times (Beijing) and Daily Beast\n\nRelated Articles\n\nChinese bombers circling Taiwan raise talk of war during Trump\u2019s first term\n\nAnxieties about war have been raised in Taiwan after Chinese bombers twice circled around Taiwan\u2019s periphery, though without entering the countries air defense identification zone (ADIZ).\n\nSome people have speculated that this is one more act from Beijing, like the seizure of the US drone, to send a message in response to Donald Trump\u2019s phone call with Taiwan\u2019s president. However, that would seem an unlikely explanation, since the two actions by the Chinese bomber occurred on November 25 and December 10, with the first action occurring prior to the phone call.\n\nHowever, Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of National Defense on Sunday appealed for calm, as further concerns were raised this weekend when China\u2019s air published a photo on social media showing a bomber flying above clouds with two mountain peaks in the distance, apparently depicting the November 25 flight. Chinese military commentators said that the peaks are of a mountain in Taiwan.\n\nChina\u2019s state media quoted a Chinese military analyst saying that military action could occur in Donald Trump\u2019s first term:\n\nMilitary conflicts would occur between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan by 2020. It is quite possible that the mainland will take the island in one stroke.\n\nHowever, another Chinese analyst is quoted as saying that China\u2019s leadership might not favor reunification by force, which would hurt both sides\u2019 interests.

Texas enacted a common sense voter ID law to safeguard the integrity of our elections, and we will continue to fight for the law in the district court, the Fifth Circuit, and if necessary, the Supreme Court again.\"\n\nBreitbart Texas reported the day before the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s order denying review of the case that a federal magistrate\u00a0delayed the next hearing in the Texas voter ID case so that the Trump Administration would have time to discuss the case with the government\u2019s lawyers. Federal lawyers filed a motion for continuance on Friday, January 20, asking the court to continue a hearing that had originally been set for January 24.\n\nIn an effort to temporarily address the \u201cdiscriminatory effects\u201d of the law as originally written, the trial court enforced a remedy shortly before the 2016 Election that allowed voters without proper ID to sign affidavits attesting to the reason why they could not obtain one before casting a regular ballot.\n\nHarris County Clerk Stan Stanart, who runs Texas\u2019 largest voting jurisdiction, told Breitbart on Sunday, \"The flawed solution pushed by the DOJ that we were forced to use last November allowed hundreds of illegal votes to be cast in Harris County.\"\n\nThe latest Supreme Court ruling sets the stage for the years-old lawsuit to continue down a track that could take many more months to resolve. The State of Texas is not without other options outside of the courtroom, however. Public Interest Legal Foundation President J. Christian Adams told Breitbart Texas that legislators can take the job of fixing the law into their own hands.\n\n\u201cThe Texas Legislature is also free to offer reforms that could serve to fix the \u2018discriminatory effects\u2019 of the law. A fix would be easy,\u201d Adams noted.\n\nIn July 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit found that Texas' voter ID law had a discriminatory effect under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act but said the district court erred in finding discriminatory intent, as reported by Breitbart Texas. The 9-6\u00a0en banc ruling held that the law did not constitute a poll tax, either. The appellate court remanded the case to the district court to determine if the voter ID provisions were written to be intentionally discriminatory.\n\nThe dissents to the opinion encompassed 100 pages. Judge Edith Jones, a Reagan nominated judge, wrote a dissent which was joined by four others. She wrote,\u00a0\"Requiring a voter to verify her identity with a photo ID at the polling place is a reasonable requirement widely supported by Texans of all races and members of the public belonging to both political parties.\"\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott said immediately after the appellate court decision, \"The 5th Circuit rightly reversed the lower court's finding of discriminatory purpose, but wrongly concluded the law had a discriminatory effect. Voter fraud is real, and it undermines the integrity of the election process.\"\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton responded to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ruling at the time, \"It is imperative that the State government safeguards our elections and ensures the integrity of our democratic process. Preventing voter fraud is essential to accurately reflecting the will of Texas voters during elections, and it is unfortunate that this common-sense law, providing protections against fraud, was not upheld in its entirety.\"\n\nThe seven acceptable forms of photo ID under the law include the following: a Texas driver's license; free Texas election identification card (EIC); Texas personal identification card; Texas license to carry a concealed handgun; U.S. military identification card; U.S. citizenship certificate; and a U.S. passport.\n\nLana Shadwick\u00a0is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

Gulen himself argues that Hizmet (\u201cservice\u201d) is a moderate Islamic alternative that has a role to play in the eradication of radical Islam.\n\nGulen opponents, including the government of Turkey, argue that, instead, Hizmet is a cult centered around Gulen in which adherents are encouraged to aid in the overthrow of the Turkish government to establish Gulen as the nation\u2019s leader.\n\nThe U.S. government has not weighed in officially on these accusations, though America\u2019s Hizmet schools have run into problems of their own. The FBI raided 19 of the schools in 2014, citing discrepancies in the group\u2019s finances.\n\nThe Turkish government has made multiple official requests for Gulen\u2019s extradition, citing the July 15 coup attempt and comparing the Hizmet movement to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, calling them both \u201cCIA projects.\u201d Turkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag visited Washington last week to personally encourage his American counterpart Loretta Lynch to begin the extradition process.\n\nIn public comments, Bozdag compared Gulen to Osama bin Laden, citing him as an equivalent danger to the stability of the Turkish government.\u00a0\"Whatever Osama bin Laden means for the United States and the American people, Fethullah Gulen means the same for Turkey and the Turkish people,\u201d he said, comparing the coup attempt to \u201can assassination attempt on President Obama and his family, where the White House was bombed [and] \u2026 tanks were marching the streets [and] \u2026 241 U.S. civilians were killed and around 3,000 were wounded.\u201d\n\nWhile Turkey has sent thousands of files to Washington related to the Gulen case, by late August, American officials confirmed that none of those documents appeared to have anything to do with the failed coup.\u00a0\"The evidence is crystal clear. We know the terrorist cult responsible for the vicious attacks against us and the Turkish people. We simply cannot understand why the U.S. cannot just hand over this individual,\" Turkish Prime Minister Binali\u00a0Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m said at the time, shortly before U.S. officials \u2013 and Turkish government spokespeople \u2013 confirmed that they had not yet compiled evidence linking Gulen to the coup.\n\nLast week, Turkish officials said they finally handed over the relevant evidence regarding Gulen and the failed coup.\n\nMeanwhile, the Turkish government has continued to crack down on individuals and media organizations it claims has\u00a0an affiliation to Gulen. This week, Turkish police shut down 15 media outlets and arrested multiple senior staffers at the newspaper\u00a0Cumhuriyet, the nation\u2019s premier secularist opposition newspaper.\u00a0Cumhuriyet grew to international recognition after facing government suppression for agreeing to publish a Turkish-language inset of the French satirical magazine\u00a0Charlie Hebdo following a jihadist attack on its\u00a0headquarters.\u00a0Cumhuriyet later published a report accusing Turkey\u2019s intelligence agency, the MIT, of supplying weapons to Syrian rebels. For that, the newspaper\u2019s editor-in-chief, Can D\u00fcndar, received a five-year prison sentence.

The odds of justice actually catching up with Hillary Clinton dwindle to almost zero if she gains the White House. She might have to sacrifice an aide here and there, but if the political system of 1998 couldn't remove her husband from office for blatant perjury, it's hard to imagine what could possibly bring The First Woman President down in the even more corrupt and confused political system of 2017.\n\nThat being said, here are a few lingering legal headaches Clinton could face:\n\n1. Perjury: Why not start with a blast from the Clinton past? Hillary Clinton signed documents testifying that she turned over all work-related emails to the State Department, on orders from a federal judge, under penalty of perjury. We already have indisputable proof she violated this sworn statement\u2026 thousands of times.\n\nThe cloud of false statements under oath surrounding Hillary Clinton is thousands of times thicker than the one around Bill. Democrats seem to have found a hidden clause in the Constitution that says Clintons can never be prosecuted for perjury, but Madame Secretary is really stress-testing that particular privilege of Clintonhood. One would think the federal judiciary had some interest in establishing that sworn documents must be taken seriously.\n\n2. Obstruction of Justice: Bill Clinton's primary motive for committing perjury was to obstruct justice\u2014it was the second count in his impeachment. (The justice he was obstructing was a sexual harassment suit from Paula Jones, at a time when liberals insisted sexual harassment was the most overlooked, under-prosecuted crime in the legal code.)\n\nHillary's thousands of perjury counts are also related to the obstruction of justice. She held back documents she didn't want Congress to see. She subverted the Freedom of Information Act, which is a law, not a lovely suggestion. \u00a0\n\nMost media timelines of the Clinton email scandal are either incomplete or deliberately obtuse, because they almost never accurately relate how her secret server was discovered. For example, these timelines from USA Today, CNN, and ABC News all get it wrong. \n\nSharyl Attkisson, who was a participant in the story, has an accurate timeline that makes the important point Clinton-friendly media outlets don't want to talk about: we know about the secret server because the State Department was sued for failing to respond to FOIA requests. The State Department's official story is that they were surprised to discover Clinton was withholding thousands of documents on her private computer. \n\nThat's straight-up obstruction of justice, in cases involving multiple federal courts, as surely as Bill Clinton's impeachable offense of obstructing the Paula Jones suit. Clinton may become untouchable if the American people allow her into the White House, but the lawsuits don't evaporate, and neither do the angry judges.\n\n3. Bribery: After the FBI set off a headline earthquake by re-opening the Clinton email investigation, we learned that several other FBI investigations of Clintonworld have been quietly in progress for some time. One of those investigations is digging into bribery allegations against the Clinton Foundation. The FBI agents working on these cases were reportedly very angry that top Bureau and Justice Department officials were pressuring them to drop their investigations.\n\nThe most attention-grabbing of these suspicions concerns an FBI official, Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, whose wife received an inexplicably huge political donation from Clinton bagman Terry McAuliffe, currently the governor of Virginia. The timing of this donation was so convenient that even the Left side of the blogosphere has produced some uneasy speculation that McCabe probably should have recused himself from all things Clinton-related.\n\nWell, he didn't recuse himself, and the conflicts of interest are so apparent that the lack of a chiseled-in-stone quid pro quo might not be enough to kill this case off. After all, corrupt officials aren't usually dumb enough to write down their quid pro quo agreements, or repeat them into microphones. The McCabe controversy already has longer legs than most observers expected, when the news first broke.\n\n4. Pay for Play: There has also been recent confirmation that the FBI has investigated influence-peddling allegations against the Clinton Foundation, which was so obviously used for that purpose that it's funny to watch Clinton apologists insist nothing can be proven in a court of law. Some of the most vigorous infighting within the Bureau reportedly concerns whether pay-for-play investigations should move forward.\n\nWikiLeaks has exposed emails from Clinton insiders that openly discuss how the Foundation was part of a network that steered millions of dollars to \"Bill Clinton Inc.\" Even longtime members of the Clinton syndicate professed themselves troubled by these operations. They were also unhappy with arrangements like Hillary Clinton's agreement to speak in Morocco after a $12 million donation to the Clinton Global Initiative.\n\nIt's entirely possible that more documentation about these suspicious Clinton Foundation dealings will come to light after the election, especially if some of the people Clinton took money from grow upset with her. It's downright dangerous to have a President with so many strings attached.\n\n5. Illegal Use of a Nonprofit Organization: There are many laws governing the management of charitable organizations, generally intended to prevent them from becoming money-laundering operations, ripoff operations, and vehicles for political influence peddling. The Clinton Foundation and its galaxy of related operations may eventually find itself answering some questions about compliance with those laws, assuming the IRS decides to stop focusing its efforts on hassling mom-and-pop pro-life groups and kitchen-table Tea Party outfits. If the Foundation is ever held to account for any other impropriety, charges of abusing a nonprofit should be part of the legal package as well.\n\n6. Racketeering: Former prosecutor Andrew McCarthy has recently observed that Hillary Clinton's abuse of the State Department looks an awful lot like a \"racketeering enterprise,\" which could trigger the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1971, more widely known as RICO. McCarthy explained:\n\nUnder RICO, an \u201centerprise\u201d can be any association of people, informal or formal, illegitimate or legitimate \u2013 it could be a Mafia family, an ostensibly charitable foundation, or a department of government. It is a racketeering enterprise if its affairs are conducted through \u201ca pattern of racketeering activity.\u201d A \u201cpattern\u201d means merely two or more violations of federal or state law; these violations constitute \u201cracketeering activity\u201d\u00a0if they are included among the extensive list of felonies laid out in the statute.\n\n7. Fraud: Wall Street analyst Charles Ortel has been building a case that the \"Clinton Charity Network,\" as he calls the complete system of Clinton operations, has committed \"charity fraud of epic proportions.\" In part, he refers to discrepancies between donor accounts and the Clinton Foundation\u2019s books. \n\nOthers have pointed out how the Clinton Health Access Initiative has essentially ignored New York state law for years, without a peep from Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (who just happens to be part of the Clinton campaign's \"leadership council.\") There are some interesting differences between the paperwork CHAI submitted to the IRS and what it submitted to the state of New York, which has more specific requirements about identifying foreign donors.\n\nIn addition to getting a free pass on perjury, the Clintons are traditionally allowed to violate tax laws without penalty, eventually refiling paperwork when \"errors\" are discovered years after the fact. Another round of whoops-my-bad, no-harm-no-foul \"refiling\" during a Hillary Clinton presidency would be embarrassing, especially if she's busy trying to ratchet up taxes on everyone else.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.56379842758179, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1247, "FairnessVirtue": 8, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 13, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.91437275302, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 37, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161101040000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.3636363636400004, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 5, "pct_mft_words": 2.9671210906174803, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/11/18/six-things-every-american-know-sen-jeff-sessions/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [2418]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 707, "scraper_regex": 757}}, "headline": "Six Things Every American Should Know About Sen.

Jeff Sessions was selected by President-elect Donald Trump to serve as his Attorney General, putting him in line to become the top law and order position of the Trump administration.\n\nHere are six things you need to know about Jeff Sessions:\n\n1: The First U.S. Senator to Endorse Donald Trump for President\n\nSessions was already familiar with Trump when the developer came to Capitol Hill to testify about proposed renovations to the U.N. headquarters in 2005. Trump argued that the proposed $1.5 billion cost was outrageous estimating that the actual cost could be done with $700 million.\n\nSessions called Trump's testimony \"a breath of fresh air\" and thanked him for showing Congress how to save money.\n\n\n\nIn September 2015, Trump traveled to Washington D.C. to attend a rally against the Iran deal. He met with Sessions afterward, prompting speculation that the veteran senator was open to endorsing Trump.\n\nIn February 2016, Sessions appeared at a rally with Trump in Mobile, Alabama and endorsed him for president, a blow for his senate colleague Ted Cruz who was also running for president.\n\n\u201cI told Donald Trump this isn\u2019t a campaign, this is a movement,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cLook at what\u2019s happening. The American people are not happy with their government.\u201d\n\nIn August 2016, Sessions wore a 'Make Mexico Great Again Also' hat while Trump outlined his tough positions on illegal immigration.\n\nGreat again. pic.twitter.com/34TJbUAz96\n\u2014 Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) November 18, 2016\n\n\n\n2: Leading opponent of amnesty:\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions is undoubtedly the biggest opponent of amnesty for illegal immigrants.\n\nSessions repeatedly denounced establishment members of both parties who worked hand in hand with top members of the business community as \"Masters of the Universe\" who worked behind closed doors to plot the legalization for illegal immigrants in Congress.\n\nHe has a drawing of He-man and Battle Cat hanging in his office together with a transcript of remarks he made in 2007, after delivering a speech denouncing President George W. Bush's efforts for immigration reform.\n\n\n\nHe reused his \"Masters of the Universe\" talking points again in 2013, opposing the amnesty pursued by the Gang of Eight, an effort that was widely supported by Silicon Valley tech giants including Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg.\n\n3. Led populist revolt against\u00a0TPP\n\nSessions was adamantly against the Transpacific Partnership trade deal, a deal that most Republicans were happy to work with Obama to get passed.\n\n\"For too long the United States has entered in the trade deals, on the promise of economic bounty only to see workers impoverished, industries disappear, manufacturing jobs declined,\" Sessions said in a speech against a vote to give Obama authority to negotiate the trade deal.\n\nSessions was one of only five Republican senators who voted against giving Obama the authority to negotiate the deal.\n\n4. Leftist Attacks:\n\nWhen President Ronald Reagan nominated Sessions in 1985 to serve as a federal judge in Alabama, Democrats were ready. Sessions was accused of being racially insensitive, and unfit to serve, as former employees testified against him.\n\nSen. Ted Kennedy denounced Sessions as \"a throwback to a shameful era which I know both black and white Americans thought was in our past.\"\n\nModerate Republican senator Arlen Specter later admitted that his vote against Sessions was \"a mistake.\"\n\n\"I have since found that Sen. Sessions is egalitarian,\" he told reporters in 2009.\n\n5. Record of supporting civil rights\n\nThe Trump campaign reacted on Friday to accusations that Sessions was too controversial a nominee.\n\nThey pointed out that as attorney general in Alabama, Sessions filed desegregation lawsuits and supported the 30-year extension of the Civil Rights Act. The Trump team noted that Sessions voted to confirm Attorney General Eric Holder and proposed awarding the Congressional Medal of Honor to Rosa Parks.\n\n6. Criminal Justice reform and the Crack Cocaine thing:\n\nDuring confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice nominee Sonia Sotomayor, Sessions told one of the witnesses that he was supportive of lowering criminal penalties for users of crack cocaine.\n\n\"Sen.

That's very hard to do with a real estate empire. The sales are hundreds of millions of dollars in individual assets, and there are a bunch of those assets, so that's a very difficult thing to do.\"\n\n\"For me, the bigger concern, frankly, is the children because if you look historically, whether that is George W. Bush, whether that's Jimmy Carter, foreign entities who are going to try to curry favor or get leverage over an American president often do it by trying to strike a sweetheart deal with a family member, often with one of the kids,\" he said. \n\n\"That's my concern: you're going to have Bahrain, or Saudi Arabia, or Russia, or Kazakhstan, or some foreign power that wants something from Donald Trump is going to offer and give a sweetheart deal to one of the kids. The kids will take it, and now, suddenly, there is some sense of either obligation or leverage or some form of embarrassment that can be used against the president,\" Schweizer warned.\n\nHe said there must be \"bright lines\" and \"transparency\" around the First Family's business dealings.\n\n\"I know that it's a private company. The Trump organization is not publicly traded, but I think they will be protecting themselves in a powerful way if they have greater transparency so that people see precisely the kinds of transactions they're engaged in,\" he recommended.\n\n\"Unlike other people that have been President of the United States, who were either not successful businessmen or marginally successful businessmen, this is an individual that's had financial success, has a large empire. It was gained legitimately in the free market,\" Schweizer noted. \"The question becomes, once he becomes president, once that transition happens, are there favors and special deals granted by foreign governments? Are the kids being given sweetheart deals by foreign powers?\" \n\n\"To me, that critical date becomes once he becomes president \u2013 and most importantly, as you said, once it is clarified precisely what they're going to do. If what we hear on the 15th is essentially, you know, 'Don't worry about it. I'm not going to be involved in the business, but everything else is going to function the same,' then I think you've got a problem,\" Schweizer said. \n\n\"I think you've got a problem not just for the country, but you've got a problem for the Trump family \u2013 because again, the sunshine is going to help them, and I don't think they know precisely what they're in for,\" he warned. \"Donald Trump's never been president. Very few people have been. I don't think they precisely know what they are in for, in terms of what foreign entities, corporations, or governments are going to try to do \u2013 because he is going to be the most powerful man in the world, who can do wonderful things to help certain countries, or hurt certain countries. So they're going to pull everything out of their playbook to try to curry favor.\" \n\n\"I just hope that they take this matter seriously, they don't try to approach it on sort of a case-by-case basis, but they have a very robust, transformative, and transparent approach\u00a0\u2013 because if they don't, the people that are going to be most damaged by this, ultimately, are the Trumps and their reputation. For me, it's only a question of time when these types of things start to take place and get thrown at the kids and the family,\" he predicted.\n\nKassam proposed another conflict of interest scenario, in which government business takes place at Trump properties, for example, visiting diplomats staying at a Trump hotel or government officials having important dinners at Trump restaurants.\n\n\"Those sorts of scenarios worry me less than the big projects,\" Schweizer responded. \"I understand precisely that, you know, you might have a Japanese delegation come and spend a lot of money at the Trump hotel. My bigger concern is about the major capital projects. The Trump organization has expanded internationally. I'm less concerned if a bunch of diplomats from a foreign country come and drop money at the bar at the Trump hotel than if a foreign government \u2013 let's say Bahrain \u2013 says, 'Oh, why don't you build a Trump Tower here in this prime real estate location, and we're going to give it to you for ten cents on the dollar?\u2019 Those are the kinds of deals where, you know, you've got a chance to make $50 million, $100 million or more off of that kind of deal.\" \n\n\"To me, the solution becomes transparency. By that, I mean major projects, whether it is building a project, whether it is financing of a project. And of course the Trumps are not required to do this, legally, but what I'm saying is they need to be transparent about that, so people can look at some project in Bahrain, or some financing deal involving Deutsche Bank, and know that they're paying market rates for that money, or what they paid for that land, or for that capital investment corresponds basically with what the market price is,\" he advised. \n\n\"Again, this is not something they legally have to do, but they are protecting themselves, and they are going the extra mile, which I think will gain goodwill with the American people. Let's remember, Donald Trump was elected by the American people for a variety of reasons. One of those was draining the swamp. One of those was the fact that the Clintons had made hundreds of millions of dollars through public service,\" Schweizer pointed out. \n\n\"The American people, I think, are hoping and expecting that Donald Trump is going to work to drain the swamp, and the best way to do that to start is by starting at the top and saying, 'We're going to take this extra step. We don't have to do this, but we're going to take this extra step and say on a quarterly basis, have a level of transparency on major projects that lets people know precisely what kind of deals we are striking around the world,'\" he said.\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\u00a0to 9:00 a.m.\u00a0Eastern.\n\nLISTEN:\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.0860585197806358, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1027, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.54428885266, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 11, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161209180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.43427458617332, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/11/29/20-year-old-north-carolina-planned-murder-hundreds-isis/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [858, 1052, 1604, 1652, 1865, 2167, 2191, 2223, 2245, 2262, 2277, 2296, 2408]}}, "headline": "20-Year-Old in North Carolina Planned to Murder Hundreds for Islamic State", "wordcount_as_scraped": 518, "date": "20161130050000", "story_content": "20-year-old Justin Nojan Sullivan pled guilty on Tuesday morning to a chilling terrorist plot in which he planned to use a silenced gun to murder hundreds of people in Virginia and North Carolina on behalf of the Islamic State.

He was planning to film the slaughter and give the video to ISIS. He also proposed pulling off a few \u201cminor assassinations\u201d for training purposes before carrying out \u201cthe big attack.\u201d\n\nSullivan admitted to being in \u201cfrequent and direct communications\u201d with ISIS recruiter Junaid Hussain in the summer of 2015.

Clark was found buried in a shallow grave behind his house, with three gunshot wounds to the head.\n\nSullivan said he robbed Clark of $689, which he intended to use for the purchase of an AR-15 rifle and ammo for his shooting spree, but he has not formally confessed to Clark\u2019s murder.

The six guns listed below are also excellent gift choices if you have a woman on your list\u2013say, a mother or grandmother who plans to keep the gun in her purse or even to carry the gun in a sweatshirt pocket while walking the kids in the park.\n\nOne of the guns on this list is so light and compact you can carry it in sweat pants or other relaxed clothing without needing to worry about the weight of the gun pulling on the pants.\n\nAnd the recoil on all these guns is minimal, as they are chambered in .380, .32 or .38 Special. They really are great guns for mothers and grandmothers who realize they are the first line of defense for their children or grandchildren should trouble strike.\n\nHere are the six pocket guns:\n\nKel-Tec P32\u2013The Kel-Tec P32 is an ultra-lightweight semiautomatic pistol chambered in .32 caliber. (By \u201cultra-lightweight\u201d I mean 6.6 ounces.) This is the gun for your sweatshirt or sweatpants, and it is certainly a front pocket pistol for people who regularly wear cargo shorts. The magazine holds seven rounds, plus one in the chamber for a total of eight. The gun has no external safety; if a bullet is in the chamber the gun is ready to go. However, the trigger pull on the P32 is long double-action only and that long pull serves to prevent accidental discharges.\n\nApproximate price for a Kel-Tec P32 is $250.\n\n\n\nRuger LCP\u2013The Ruger LCP is one of the most popular pocket guns on the market. It weights in at 9.6 ounces\u2013extremely light\u2013and is chambered in .380. It holds six rounds in the magazine plus one in the chamber, for a total of seven rounds. Like the Kel-Tec P32, the Ruger has no external safety mechanism. Rather, it has the long double-action only trigger pull that helps prevent accidental discharges. The LCP is an extremely durable gun in a slightly larger caliber than the Kel-Tec, yet it is diminutive enough that front pocket carry or purse carry is no problem.\n\nApproximate price for a Ruger LCP is $250-$270.\n\n\n\nGlock 42\u2013The Glock 42 is a sub-compact pistol that is larger than the Kel-Tec or Ruger, yet still small enough for pocket or purse carry. It is chambered in .380 and holds six rounds in the magaizne and one in the chamber, for a total of seven. The 42 weighs 13.76 ounces. The gun\u2019s weight makes the recoil of the .380 round even easier to handle, which makes the 42 a great concealed carry gun for women (or anyone looking for less recoil). The 42 has a very short trigger pull\u2013compared to the Kel-Tec or Ruger\u2013and has a trigger safety that is part of the Glock \u201cSafe Action\u201d system. The Glock 42 is very comfortable to carry, easy to use, and has Glock dependability on its side.\n\nApproximate price for Glock 42 is $420-450.\n\n\n\nSig Sauer P238\u2013The Sig Sauer P238\u00a0is a .380 pistol that operates on a single action platform. This means it has a hammer that has to be cocked\u2013either manually (with your thumb) or by racking the slide. The P238 has an external thumb safety and holds six rounds in the magazine and one in the chamber, for a total of seven rounds. The P238 weighs 15.2 ounces, making it a great gun for women who plan to carry a gun in their purse or bag instead of on their person. The P238\u2019s external saftey provides added protection against an accidental discharge.\n\nApproximate price for Sig Sauer P238 is $680.\n\n\n\nKimber Micro Carry\u2013The Kimber Micro Carry is a concealed carry pistol chambered in .380. \u00a0It weighs in at 14.8 ounces and holds seven rounds of ammunition in the magazine and one in the chamber, for a total of eight. Like the Sig Sauer P238, the Micro Carry operates on a single action platform and has a hammer that must be cocked. The Micro Carry also has an external safety, like the P238. An important note on the Micro Carry\u2013it shoots as if it were a much larger gun with a much longer barrel. The accuracy of this gun is incredible. The Micro Carry is a great gun for men and women, suitable for pocket carry in cargo shorts or pants, and certainly a great gun for purse carry.\n\nApproximate price for a Kimber Micro Carry (the Two-Tone model was tested) \u2014 $650.\n\n\n\nSmith & Wesson 638 Airweight\u2013The Smith & Wesson 638 Airweight is a classic Smith & Wesson snub-nose revolver with two notable upgrades: 1. The gun\u2019s hammer is concealed, to avoid snags when drawing it from a pocket or purse. 2. The weight of the gun is greatly reduced via the use of aluminum alloy. Because of the use of alloy the 638 Airweight only weighs 14.6 ounces. It holds five rounds of .38 Special +P ammunition. This a great gun for front pocket carry in cargo shorts and similar clothing, and the gun is well suited to being carried in a purse or bag. The gun is very simple to operate, which makes it a good choice if being purchased for a mother or grandmother who is not well-acquainted with firearms.\n\nApproximate price for Smith & Wesson 638 Airweight is $480-$500.\n\n\n\nWhether you plan on carrying one of these guns in a pocket or a purse, it would be wise to purchase a pocket holster to go with the gun. This does two things: 1. Covers the trigger to prevent unintentional discharges. 2. Keeps the gun clean and the barrel free of debris if the firearm spends considerable time in a purse or bag. As with all firearm purchases, be sure you are familiar with the laws of your state before buying and practice up once you acquire the weapon. Nothing will build confidence like knowing where the bullet will go, should you have to use the gun while under duress.\n\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of \"Bullets with AWR Hawkins,\" a Breitbart News podcast.

China nominally advertises a strict non-separatist foreign policy, however, going as far as to call groups seeking independence from sovereign states one of the world\u2019s \u201cthree evil forces\u201d along with terrorism and \u201cextremism.\u201d\n\nChina has largely opposed separatist movements worldwide as a way of seeking support for their own opposition to separatists within China. The nation currently faces four major independence movements: in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang. While the Tibet and Xinjiang separatist movements are more conventionally aspirational, Hong Kong and Taiwan \u2014 unlike some groups China supports despite its nominal opposition to separatism \u2014 already support independent, anti-communist governments.\n\nThis has not stopped the Chinese Communist Party from demanding that all nations disregard Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty and the calls for freedom from the other three regions.\u00a0\u201cWe will never allow any person, any group, any political party, at any time, in any way, to split from China any part of its territory,\u201d\u00a0Xi asserted in a speech in November. \u201cTo uphold our national sovereignty and territorial integrity, to never let our country split again and to never let history repeat itself \u2013 these are our solemn promises to our people and to our history.\u201d\n\nChina has begun demanding more loudly that other nations do not regard Taiwan as a sovereign nation since then-President-elect Donald Trump spoke to Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and questioned the wisdom of the \u201cOne China\u201d policy, which states the United States cannot engage Taiwan.\n\nOutside its own borders, China has attempted to keep with its anti-separatist policies when there is no direct benefit for the Communist Party in the way. China opposed the independence of Kosovo from Serbia, for example, claiming the creation of that state would lead to a \u201cgrave negative impact\u201d in the region. While the Chinese Foreign Ministry never commented on it, state-run newspapers opposed Scotland\u2019s bid for independence from the UK. China has been lukewarm on calls from\u00a0Marxist Kurdish groups to create an independent Kurdistan, with state media even condemning the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), a Marxist terrorist group. Even in the face of\u00a0separatism promoted by sometimes-ally Russia in Ukraine, the Chinese government issued a statement saying,\u00a0\"We respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.\"\n\nAs Xi\u2019s stance on a Palestinian state shows, however, China is willing to shelve this policy under circumstances where Beijing may have something to gain. China publicly applauded the independence of South Sudan, where it has loaned\u00a0millions in aid and stationed hundreds of \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d troops.

The holiday season, in particular, provides additional opportunities for violent extremists to target public events and places where people congregate.\nThough we know of no intelligence that is both specific and credible at this time of a plot by terrorist organizations to attack the homeland, the reality is terrorist-inspired individuals have conducted, or attempted to conduct, attacks in the United States.\n\nThe NTAS bulletin, issued November 15, noted that the DHS and the FBI are collaborating with the private sector as well as state, local, and tribal partners to deal with the current threat environment.\n\nAhead of the Thanksgiving Day Parade and Black Friday shopping, the New York Police Department (NYPD) expressed concern about the ISIS magazine and has stepped up security as a result.\n\nIn response to the deadly Nice attack and the recent ISIS threat, the NYPD has added a new layer of security this year's annual parade by placing heavy sand trucks at cross streets along the parade to protect from any attack involving vehicles.\n\n\u201cI think this year you are going to see a lot more blocker cars and sand trucks on the cross streets,\u201d revealed New York City Police Commissioner James O\u2019Neill.\n\n\u201cThe Nice attack was an indicator of something we had to make adjustments because of,\u201d added New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. \u201cThat\u2019s why the sand trucks are there.

And now we are looking only to the future.\nWe assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.\nFrom this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.\nFrom this moment on, it's going to be America First.\nEvery decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.\nWe must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.\u00a0 Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.\nI will fight for you with every breath in my body \u2013 and I will never, ever let you down.\nAmerica will start winning again, winning like never before.\nWe will bring back our jobs.

And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.\nTogether, We Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Proud Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd, Yes, Together, We Will Make America Great Again.

Those storm safe rooms can run up\u00a0to 30 percent higher in already costly construction.\n\nThe Fort Worth City Council plans to revise\u00a0its building codes on December 6 to guidelines based on the adopted 2015 International Building Code\u00a0(IBC) as well as a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recommendation that says new schools with at least 50 students must have a designated storm shelter\u00a0that can withstand winds in excess of 250 mph, an EF5 tornado, the\u00a0Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported.\n\nThe Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area sits in Tornado Alley, a large geographic region that\u00a0cuts through the Midwest, running\u00a0from central Texas, up through\u00a0Oklahoma and as far north as eastern South Dakota. Of the\u00a0estimated 1,224 tornadoes that touch down each year in the United States, roughly 155 of them happen in Texas during the season, which tends to occur in April through June.\n\nLast year, on December 26, Shields Elementary School\u00a0in the Red Oak Independent School District located south of Dallas was torn apart by a tornado. Area TV news outlets reported varying wind speeds ranging from EF1 (88-11o mph) to EF3 (165 mph). Luckily, the storm happened over the Christmas holiday break and no one was in the school, but in January, 500 returning students had to complete the year at another campus. When Shields reopened\u00a0in August 2016, the repairs were estimated at nearly\u00a0$13 million.\n\nThese storm shelters\u00a0are expensive. FEMA estimates their complex design and building costs run as much as 30 percent higher than the costs of regular construction but the flip side of such expenditures is the potential loss of human life during a tornado. In 2013,\u00a0an EF4 hit an Oklahoma school, which did not have a shelter, and seven students died, according to the Star-Telegram.\n\nThe push to build the safe rooms comes in response to the 2015 IBC update and the current\u00a0International Code Council (ICC) standards for storm shelters that can hold students and staff inside safely for hours.\u00a0Fort Worth is among a growing number of Texas cities to adopt the IBC building code policy since 2006. Affiliated municipalities are listed\u00a0alphabetically on the ICC\u2019s website.\n\nNot every school district is so quick to construct shelters despite these building codes. They point to ballooning construction costs and, according to KTVT, some just wait for their cities to adopt the regulations first. Such was the case in Mesquite, another Dallas suburb.\n\nIn\u00a0September, the Mesquite ISD school board approved an $18 million high school campus expansion and renovation which included a storm shelter. The City of Mesquite already adopted the 2015 IBC and the new construction had to conform at Mesquite High. The Mesquite News reported architects designed the structure to accommodate 1,200, contain six classrooms, two individual restrooms, a fire-riser, mechanical room, stairs, and wide corridors with collaboration space.\n\nThe Fort Worth newspaper singled out Northwest ISD as\u00a0one school district that hopes to get their campuses permitted for storm shelters before April 1, which is the deadline for when these tornado shelter building codes go into effect\u00a0for Fort Worth area public schools.\u00a0District\u00a0spokeswoman Emily Conklin said\u00a0an elementary schools was approved with 2008 bond money, another, a middle school, was approved in 2012.\n\nConversely, in 2015, a tornado totaled two schools in\u00a0Van ISD. Both an elementary and an intermediate school\u00a0were directly on the path of an EF3. Although they rebuilt their facilities in Van Zandt County, the district did not include a shelter because the city of Van maintains 2009 building codes which do not have shelter requirements.\n\nFollow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on\u00a0Twitter.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 19, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.423728823661804, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 651, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.8789440779, "HarmVirtue": 10, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 19, "mft_sum": 36, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161128150000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.27272727273, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 6, "pct_mft_words": 5.52995391705069, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/11/30/captured-militant-iraqi-sunnis-saw-isis-champion-shiite-oppression/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [912, 921, 1089, 1109, 1291, 1312, 1937, 2860, 2866, 3304]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 768, "scraper_regex": 608}}, "headline": "Captured Jihadis: Mosul\u2019s Sunnis Indoctrinated to Support Islamic State", "wordcount_as_scraped": 608, "date": "20161201050000", "story_content": "On Tuesday, Reuters published an interesting set of interviews with captured Islamic State militants in Kurdish custody. They talked about the appeal of the Islamic State and illuminated the difficulty of putting ISIS-dominated cities like Mosul back together again.\n\n\u201cThey described how Islamic State transformed them from ordinary Mosul citizens into jihadists through promises and threats and said unjust treatment of their Sunni community by the Shi\u2019ite-led government and armed forces played a major role,\u201d Reuters summarized.\n\nOne of the militants, a soft-spoken 20-year-old named Ismail, said he and his fellows \u201cloved\u201d the Islamic State caliphate, which ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared in Mosul two years ago because \u201cthey relieved us of the oppression of the Shiites.\u201d\n\nThis mirrors comments from Mosul collected by the UK\u00a0Guardian\u00a0over the summer, such as a college student who said, \u201cISIS with all its brutality is more honest and merciful than the Shia government in Baghdad and its militias.\u201d\n\nA\u00a0National Geographic\u00a0look at Mosul in October quoted residents who remembered clapping and tossing sweets at ISIS trucks when they rolled through the city as conquerors:\n\nA soldier from Mosul, quoted by\u00a0National Geographic,\u00a0said the Islamic State\u2019s conquest of the city was not quite as sudden as most distant observers believe because there was already a \u201cdissident underworld\u201d in place \u2014 a mixture of \u201cIslamists, nationalists, guns for hire, and young men with nothing better to do\u201d \u2014 who were already talking about launching a coup against the Shiite government in Baghdad.\n\nOthers described brutal treatment at the hands of the Iraqi army, charges the government in Baghdad has denied. The captured militants said foreign fighters tended to be the most enthusiastic and determined converts to the Islamic State, while some of their Iraqi forces\u00a0were little better than hired gangsters. Some recruits said they were pressed into service with economic pressure and threats against family members.\n\nAlong those lines, CNN reported allegations on Wednesday that ISIS is deliberately cutting off water supplies to neighborhoods as the Iraqi army advances into the city, because they want to \u201cforce people to retreat with them in order to use them as human shields,\u201d according to a Mosul City Council official.\n\n\u201cThere is a clear pattern that we have seen in many of the cities and towns ISIS has occupied: that they will use water, food, anything to coerce the population,\u201d confirmed Lise Grande, a UN humanitarian coordinator in Iraq. Mosul households are now reportedly waiting for days to pull a few jugs of unclean water out of makeshift wells.\n\nThis could put a troubling spin on reports that the \u201cspirit is broken\u201d among ISIS militants in Mosul. Much would depend on\u00a0which\u00a0militants are breaking. Ismail, the prisoner interviewed by Reuters, told a harrowing tale of being caught in a hideout with other low-level recruits who contemplated suicide by grenade as Kurdish rockers rained down around them. The hardcore foreign recruits could be handling the stress very differently than local cannon fodder pressed into service after ISIS captured Mosul.\n\nHow those expendable recruits handle life after ISIS will\u00a0be a serious concern. There will be many opportunities for sectarian strife to flare up and old grudges to be settled. Civilians will be traumatized by years under the Islamic State\u2019s brutality. Displaced residents will be returning to war-torn neighborhoods.\n\nSome ISIS sympathizers will surely remain, and those who loathed the Islamic State hold unpleasant memories of how quickly Iraqi forces were routed after the caliphate was declared and how the central government seemed to abandon the city. The Sunni-Shiite divide will remain and may well generate new horrors in the future.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 1, "tone": -4.91606712341309, "HarmVice": 6, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 768, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.71207888912, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161201050000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006, "FairnessVice": 1, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 4.16666666666667, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/11/22/turkey-issues-warrant-head-us-backed-kurdish-militia/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [123, 163, 364, 391, 513, 1933, 2605, 3388]}}, "headline": "Turkey Issues Warrant for Head of Pro-American Kurdish Militia", "wordcount_as_scraped": 557, "date": "20161123040000", "story_content": "The Turkish government has issued a warrant for the arrest of\u00a0Salih Muslim, one of the leaders of the\u00a0Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD). The PYD\u2019s military wings, the YPG and YPJ, are longtime American allies on the ground against the Islamic State in Syria.\n\nThe Kurdish outlet Rudaw reports\u00a0that Turkey has implicated\u00a0Muslim in a February 2016 bombing in Ankara perpetrated by a Kurdish terrorist group, the Marxist Kurdistan Freedom Hawks\u00a0(TAK). 28 people died in that bombing. The Turkish government has issued another 47 warrants in relation to the bombing in addition to Muslim\u2019s.\n\nThe government\u2019s announcement, published through state outlet Anadolu Agency, tied the bombing to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), a Marxist, U.S.-designated terrorist organization. It remains uncertain whether TAK is a division of the PKK or whether TAK\u2019s founders were former PKK terrorists disenchanted with the PKK leadership\u2019s calls for peaceful negotiations with Ankara. American officials have referred to TAK as an \u201curban terrorist wing\u201d of the PKK, which is also active in the desert areas of Syria and Iraq, particularly against the Islamic State terrorist group.\n\nMuslim\u2019s group is a separatist political entity in Rojava, or Syrian Kurdistan. The PYD and its militias operate separately from the PKK, though they are ideologically aligned with the group, despite Washington\u2019s rejection of the PKK. YPG and YPJ militias have helped American fighter jets target Islamic State positions in Syria. While the PYD has long called for Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad to step aside and allow the nation to choose a new leader, the group became increasingly vocal against removing Assad before the Islamic State was completely vanquished, warning that ISIS could easily exploit such a power vacuum.\n\nMuslim has personally denied any involvement in the Ankara bombing.\u00a0\"These accusations are clearly related to Turkish attempts to intervene in Syria,\" he said in February, shortly following the attack.\n\nSecretary of Defense Ashton Carter has confirmed that the United States has evidence linking the PYD to the PKK, however. American officials have publicly dissuaded Muslim\u2019s group from affiliating with the PKK.\n\nThe warnings have done little to dissuade the PYD from cooperating with Americans or even welcoming independent American fighters into their group. PYD supporters even established Facebook groups last year to help Americans, particularly U.S. veterans seeking to fight the Islamic State independent of their government, find\u00a0the YPG and YPJ militias, and fund their trips to Kurdistan. Many Americans, Canadians, and other Westerners used online crowdfunding to pay their voyages to Syria.\n\nEven official American troops on the ground have expressed solidarity with the PYD, so much so that the Pentagon had to issue a new directive in May banning Green Berets from wearing YPG insignia on their uniforms under their American flags, in an attempt to curb Turkish outrage.\n\nThe Syrian Kurdish militias have a tense relationship with their Iraqi counterparts, the Peshmerga. The Peshmerga have actively dissuaded individual Western volunteers from joining them, derisively referring them to less \u201cprofessional\u201d militias like the YPG. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) of Iraq, the political organization\u00a0of the Peshmerga, has demanded the YPG stay out of Iraq and backed Turkey in its objections to PKK violence.\n\nMuslim has reached out to the KRG, however, hoping the two militias could cooperate against the Islamic State.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.9182283878326403, "HarmVice": 6, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 544, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.4736314862800004, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161123040000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.14705882352941, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/12/23/peter-navarro-china-reacts/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [89, 198, 989, 1071, 1461, 1509, 1575, 1981, 2048, 2391, 3113, 3122]}}, "headline": "Beijing Goes Ballistic after Peter Navarro Appointment", "wordcount_as_scraped": 574, "date": "20161224000000", "story_content": "China is reacting angrily following\u00a0news that President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Peter Navarro, author of the book and film Death by China,\u00a0to head the new White House National Trade Council.\n\nThe London Financial Times reported that Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said immediately after the appointment that Beijing is now monitoring the policy positions of the incoming Trump Administration: \"As two major powers with broad mutual interests, co-operation is the only correct choice.\"\n\nChina's Foreign Minister Wang Yi later told the People's Daily, the official Communist Party news organ, that China and the U.S. now faced \"new, complicated and uncertain factors affecting bilateral relations\u201d.

On this occasion, it is urgent for us to reflect on 3 key lessons that the fall of the Evil Empire provided. They are lessons that the new incoming Trump administration must put into action immediately vis-\u00e0-vis our enemy in the terror war.\n\nLesson #1: Go on the Offense Against Islamic Supremacism\n\nWhile we know that the Soviet Union collapsed, on many realms, from within, the record is clear that President Reagan also fueled the collapse. By moving against d\u00e9tente and beyond containment, Reagan's aggressive anti-communism saw the U.S. take on a strategic offensive against the Soviet Union which led to victory. As Paul Kengor has documented in his book, The Crusader, Reagan fought not to just contain, but to win. His administration's massive defense build-up, support of anti-communist rebels around the world, support of dissident movements behind the Iron Curtain, promotion of SDI, and many other aggressive policies put a heavy pressure on the Soviet Union that ultimately broke its already fragile legs.\n\nThus, we see how in our present-day conflict with Islamic Supremacism, we need to go on the offensive. In order to do that, we must first take two crucial steps. The first step is to name the enemy; the second is to formulate an actual doctrine against him. As Sebastian Gorka urges in Defeating Jihad, the U.S. government needs to lay down a vision, an actual \"threat doctrine analysis\" in a thorough document, just like George Kennan's Long Telegram and NSC-68 did in laying out the strategic foundation to fighting communism in the Cold War. The new incoming Trump administration, therefore, must articulate a threat doctrine analysis and then shape it into a Reagan-like doctrine of offense.\n\nLesson #2: Deceive the Totalitarian Enemy into Being Pluralistic\n\nIn Reagan\u2019s War, Peter Schweizer revealed how the Reagan administration cleverly promoted the process of change within the Soviet Union towards a more pluralistic political and economic system. This was a brilliant approach, seeing that Gorbachev\u2019s policies of Glasnost and Perestroika clearly triggered communism's collapse.\n\nHenry Kissinger has shrewdly delineated how Gorbachev\u2019s effort to reform, as well as to salvage, Soviet communism was the very ingredient that fueled its disintegration. Indeed, once Moscow ended its total and intrusive control of its satellites, and once it allowed free discussion, it signed its own death warrant. Gorbachev wanted to de-Stalinize, yet he could not do so without destroying the regime itself. Kissinger writes:\n\nGorbachev\u2019s gamble on liberalization was bound to fail. To the degree that the Communist Party had lost its monolithic character, it became demoralized. Liberalization proved incompatible with communist rule \u2014 the communists could not turn themselves into democrats without ceasing to be communists, an equation Gorbachev never understood.\n\nTo be sure, the whole idea of de-Stalinization was based on the assumption that the Soviet regime could survive without its despotic component; that it could endure a reconciliation with its past. But a legitimate examination of the causes of Stalinism could not occur without an uncensored evaluation of Leninism, which the Soviet system could not allow without risking the de-legitimization of its entire foundation.\n\nThis is a crucial lesson for our leadership in the terror war. But first, let us be clear: we must not buy into Natan Sharansky's naive assumption that all people want freedom. They do not, especially Sharia-believers. The dark consequences of the so-called \"Arab Spring\" taught us this painful lesson well, as we witnessed the process of \"democratization\" in the Middle East lead to a totalitarian Islamist Winter.\n\nBut this does not mean that we do not heed one of Sharansky's profound implications: that we must follow Reagan's example of undermining the enemy by encouraging certain tyrannical entities to behave like pluralists. There is huge potential in nudging tyrants to open up free discussion and to hold their terror back \u2013\u00a0for freedom and spoken truth have a corrosive effect on tyranny's chains. Indeed, just imagine, for instance, if leaders within the Islamic world started showing off how pluralistic they were and began allowing a free and honest discussion on the ingredients of their prophet Mohammed's life.\n\nLesson #3: Verbally\u00a0Take the Moral High Ground\n\nIn his June 1982 speech before the British House of Commons, President Reagan announced that he had a long-term plan \u201cwhich will leave Marxism-Leninism on the ash heap of history.\u201d The next year, on March 8, 1983, he famously called the Soviet Union the \u201cEvil Empire.\u201d Four years later, in June 1987, he challenged Gorbachev to \u201ctear down\u201d the Berlin Wall. All of these pronouncements were crucial in the U.S. strategy of defeating Soviet communism. They upped the stakes and achieved moral clarity. They cut the dividing line between the good guys and the bad guys, and they called out the Soviets for the evil oppressors that they were. In so doing, these pronouncements also made it clear that the future was not on the Soviets' side.\n\nWilliam F. Buckley, Jr. profoundly noted that by calling the Soviet Union the \"Evil Empire,\" Reagan had formulated the galvanizing summation to Alexander Solzhenitsyn\u2019s Gulag Archipelago and, consequently, \"the countdown for Communism began then.\" And indeed, two years after challenging Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall, the wall came down.\n\nThe lesson here for the new incoming president is that the moral difference between our side and Islamic Supremacism must be spoken. The divide must be drawn in no uncertain terms.\n\nPresident Trump can be most effective in this regard by bringing attention to all the victims of Sharia and Jihad, and emphasizing that Muslims are also the victims of Islamic Supremacism. One of the most urgent causes to promote is the women's rights issue. American leadership must make it transparently clear, once and for all, which civilization stands for women and what entity denigrates and mutilates them.\n\nTrump must deliver a special speech that unveils the victims of honor killings, acid attacks and female genital mutilation, and of forced veiling, forced marriage and forced segregation under Islam \u2013 and issue a concrete challenge as Reagan did to Gorbachev. He must point to the tyrannical wall of Islamic gender apartheid and pronounce unequivocally: Imams, muftis and clerics of the world, tear down this wall.\n\nTrump must do this while simultaneously shattering the Left's and Muslim Brotherhood's favorite propaganda lie: that standing up to Islamic Supremacism and telling the truth about its inspirations is somehow instigating hatred of all Muslim people. This is a pernicious ploy based on a faulty conflation of Islam with Muslims. It must be made categorically clear that we are dealing with an ideology; we are not hating all the people who fall under its grasp. There are millions of people who go under the label \"Muslim\" but who may not agree with, or follow, all Islamic mandates, or who may want to reform them, or who may not even know anything about them \u2013\u00a0or who may have simply been born into the religion and were never even given a choice as to who they wanted to be. We have no problem with these people. And as a matter of fact, our standing up to Islamic Supremacism is a defense of these Muslims because they are, like millions of Muslims around the world, also victims of Islamic Supremacism.\n\nAll in all, the point must be driven home that we are on the side of Muslim people, and especially of those, like Zuhdi Jasser, who seek to reform Islam and bring it into the modern world.\n\nAnd so, in reflecting on these three lessons of the fall of the Soviet Union 25 years ago, we begin to gauge how, if applied with precision, they can help our new incoming president launch a winning strategy against our enemy in the terror war. Trump shows every sign that he can and will achieve this. He has demonstrated himself to be a good man who loves his country and who wants the best for it. He has shown a willingness to name the enemy and to take the war to him. He has also surrounded himself with all the noble and high-caliber people who are determined to set America on the winning course.\n\nIf all these pieces fall into place, President Trump will succeed, as Reagan did, in setting the stage for yet another glorious chapter \u2013 a chapter that sees an Evil Empire stagger to its knees and then, when finally shamed and crippled, cast where it belongs: on the ash heap of history.\n\nJamie Glazov is the editor of Frontpagemag.com.

We need to not allow the will of the people to be ignored, and the only way to do that is, presently the status quo is so far from wanting to drain the swamp that we knew 'the status quo has got to go.' I've kinda been preaching that for a few decades now, ever since the little local city council seats that I was elected to, but I'm not the only one who believes that, obviously,\" Palin said.\n\n\"People have faith in their own decision-making abilities for their families, for their businesses. They don't want some far-off politicians and bureaucrats making decisions for them. The only way to do that, to allow that independence and our priorities to be met, is to get rid of the people who want to control We the People,\" she contended.\n\nMarlow suggested Palin's nomination for Vice-President marked the beginning of the anti-establishment movement that culminated in the election of Donald Trump and Mike Pence. She modestly insisted that she didn't see herself that way, because she \"wonderfully, naively\" believed it was common sense to understand that the Constitution limits government and elevates the individual.\n\n\"I do think a lot of the Trump movement started in the Tea Party days, when enough people were saying 'enough,'\" Palin said. \"But see, the Establishment wouldn't listen, and they got worse since the Tea Party days. They got worse with shocking betrayals, and they literally doubled down on debt. They divided Americans. People started seeing, since the Tea Party days, how corruption in our government affects their lives. So they got worse, and they got cocky, but they also got caught, and we got stronger. \u2018Bigly,\u2019 as Trump would say \u2014 bigly stronger in these years since, and our grumbles, they grew into rumbles as we didn't divert our eyes from seeing the Naked Emperor. Now, during the Trump movement, enough people said 'enough.'\"\n\nPalin saw Trump's Rust Belt victory as important because those states represent \"so much of America's heart, and our work ethic, and the unpretentious blue collar, pro-family, pro-God and guns and Constitution\u2026\"\n\n\"So many Americans, like the people in the Rust Belt still, no matter where we live \u2013 in big cities, in tiny little villages \u2013 it's such a common theme. I think that's within all of our DNA,\" she said. \"Like I said, we can make our own decisions. Politicians, quit it. Quit making decisions for us.\"\n\nShe recalled being surprised and \"ticked off\" back in 2008 when the McCain campaign didn't make a serious effort in Michigan.\n\n\"I said, 'What do you mean, we're not going to Michigan? Every vote counts!'\" she remembered, and was stunned to learn the campaign had \"essentially given up on the Rust Belt.\"\n\n\"The people who build America, we're going to\u00a0give up on them? That's what it told me,\" she said. \"We tried to get to Michigan anyway, but the McCain campaign, the people running that, they were a bunch of yahoos, to tell you the truth. I mean, they've said enough bad things about me that I can finally be candid about who they are.\"\n\nPalin proudly recalled being \"politically incorrect\" in 2008, as she \"spoke candidly about where America was headed \u2013 with our debt, with our ignoring the will of the people, in the Rust Belt and elsewhere.\"\n\n\"The media was absolutely out of control with that herd mentality of corporate media, where one person jumped on a bandwagon of 'Oh, my goodness, she's so politically incorrect, we just don't understand her,'\" she said. \"So many of them jumped on that, and you know, it wasn't pleasant.\"\n\nPalin said the message of \"Enough!\" from the heartland was directed at corporate media, as well as government. \"We knew we needed a revolution to change things, and we found our revolutionary, Donald Trump. He's our messenger,\" she said. \"Donald Trump heard the voice of the people, and allowed the people to expose what needed exposing, and he spoke it for us. That included a biased media. And we told corporate media over these years, 'Stop it, just stop it, or we will shut you down.' They were on trial, essentially \u2013 and they lost. And now this corporate media, and their exaggerations and their lies, and their politics of personal destruction, thank God they are irrelevant.\"\n\nPalin added that \"exposure of the political machines on both sides of the aisle\" helped push Middle America to the point of saying, \"We're not going to\u00a0take it any more.\"\n\n\"We're going to take a stand for justice, for righteousness in our government. We're not going to take this corruption any more,\" she said. \"I think the enormous betrayals that Americans have gone through in these eight years, where we worked really hard to send reinforcements of commonsense Constitutional conservatives to Congress to clean things up, and quit raising the debt ceiling, and quit quantitative easing, allowing money to be printed out of nowhere, and devaluing our dollar, all these crazy things that were going on.\" \n\n\"We worked hard to send those to the Senate, and to the House, to rein in an Administration that's obviously been out of control \u2013 and yet, too many of those politicians betrayed us. And after a couple of elections of being betrayed, people opened their eyes and they said, we don't have to take it any more,\" Palin declared.\n\nShe\u00a0said that if Trump had not \"eked out\" a win in 2016, we would find ourselves \"in the throes of the fundamental transformation of America that candidate Barack Obama had promised that he was going to do to America, and it would be transformed into something that we don't recognize.\"\n\n\"We would have seen, as you pointed out, no borders, and you don't have a nation if you have no borders,\" she told Marlow. \"You would have seen that quashing of our freedom of speech. And even in the cultural aspect of what they were able to influence for too long, is that political correctness. If you were politically incorrect \u2013 according to their subjective, arbitrary double standards \u2013 you would be vilified, you would be ridiculed. Most people, they don't want to be vilified, they don't want to be ridiculed, so they start shutting down. They don't express their opinion any more.\" \n\n\"Talk about Rules for Radicals and Alinskyisms, Orwellian stuff, this is what happens when people start shutting down and not feeling free to express their diverse opinions in the cultural aspect,\" she continued. \"Well then, even legislatively, it becomes easier to start legislating against freedom of speech. And that's where they want to go. It's control of the people again. So thank God we won, and we're going to\u00a0have eight years to shore up the knowledge of the significance of our First Amendment rights and the Bill of Rights. I tell ya, we have to be so extremely thankful, because we knew America was at a crossroads. We knew we were going to go one way or the other.\"\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\u00a0to 9:00 a.m.\u00a0Eastern.\n\nListen to the complete audio of Palin\u2019s interview above.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 5, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.23932814598083, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1271, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.44273251683, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161126060000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002, "FairnessVice": 1, "MoralityGenera": 4, "pct_mft_words": 2.4390243902438997, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/12/26/abc-news-worries-hate-hoaxes-discredit-muslims/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [2251, 2289, 3384]}}, "headline": "ABC News Worries Hate Hoaxes 'Discredit' Muslims", "wordcount_as_scraped": 531, "date": "20161227030000", "story_content": "Following a wave of hate crime hoaxes generally reported to make President-Elect Donald Trump supporters look deplorable, ABC News is now highlighting the hardships of the fake claims on Muslims.\n\nIn a piece which states that hate hoaxes by Muslim-Americans \"discredit\" Muslims altogether, ABC News interviewed Islamic followers to shed pity for the Muslim community after a New York City Muslim woman hoaxed an attack by Trump supporters:\n\nAfter two reports of anti-Muslim hate crimes were determined to be fake by authorities this month, the Muslim community is concerned that these \u201cfew false reports\u201d are going to \u201cunfairly discredit and delegitimize the dozens of real anti-Muslim hate crimes and instances Islamophobia out there,\u201d according to the Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC).\n\u201cThe way our community is treated in the media is unfortunately very monolithic,\u201d MPAC spokeswoman Rabiah Ahmed told ABC News today. \u201cWhen one person acts out \u2014 whether it\u2019s making a false report or some other type of bad behavior \u2014 it\u2019s often looked upon as if the whole community is responsible for it, and it\u2019s saddening.\u201d\n\nIn a New York City hate crime hoax, the Muslim woman alleged that Trump supporters attacked her on the subway, calling her a \"terrorist\" and blamed New Yorkers for not stepping in to help her.\n\nA week after the incident was reported as fact by BuzzFeed and other mainstream media outlets, police announced that the Muslim woman had fabricated the incident.\n\nShe was then pictured going into court on charges for faking a police report with a shaved head and eyebrows sans hijab, a Muslim headdress. Sources told the New York Daily News that her parents shaved her head as punishment and were similarly upset that she was dating a Christian.\n\nIn a similar incident, a Muslim woman in Louisiana hoaxed a hate crime immediately following Trump's victory against Hillary Clinton, as Breitbart Texas reported.

Even in the bible, Perry writes, \"whole chunks of his life are missing. Jesus goes from age 12 to 30, without any word of what happened in-between.\"\n\n\"What we do have are lots of sources completed several decades after the fact, by authors of the gospels who wanted to promote the faith,\" he writes.\n\nMoreover, the \"gospels themselves are contradictory,\" he adds, with \"competing Easter stories\" and no real names attached to many of them, \"but rather an apostle's who 'signing off' on the manuscript.\" There is also \"evidence that the gospels were heavily edited over the years.\"\n\nPerry does acknowledge that Roman historians Josephus and Tacitus do make \"a few, scant remarks about his life,\" but that was a century after Jesus's time, he says, and their testimony could have been tampered with by Christians.\n\nWhile holding that \"the historical record itself is thin,\" meaning that there are \"no birth records, no trial transcripts, no death certificates,\" Perry fails to note the very obvious fact that we actually have very little evidence for anyone in the ancient world, especially if the person wasn't an emperor, general or aristocrat.\n\nAs one more sensible atheist has written, we possess \"about as much evidence for Jesus as we have for other, analogous preachers and prophets of his time. In fact, we have slightly more for him than most.\"\n\nAtheist scholar Tim O'Neill notes that almost all non-Christian scholars fully accept evidence from Tacitus and Josephus, \"as being evidence that Jesus was, in fact, a historical figure.\"\n\n\"The mentions of him by those writers are exactly what would we expect if someone like Jesus existed,\" he observes.\n\nOr as Dr. James Kennedy, himself a Christian, has written: \"The evidence is all on Christianity's side. Let's take a tally: twenty seven books of the New Testament, nineteen pagan writers, and three Jewish writers testify to Jesus Christ's historical reality.\"\n\nIn point of fact, we \"know\" Jesus of Nazareth really existed just as far as we can know any historical fact. That is to say, none of us was present on the earth two thousand years ago to empirically verify Jesus' existence, so we must rely on the historical record. But the historical record is as conclusive as we could possibly hope for, and much better than the record of many people whose existence no one doubts.\n\nAs Theodore Dalrymple noted some years ago in The City Journal: \"If I questioned whether George Washington died in 1799, I could spend a lifetime trying to prove it and find myself still, at the end of my efforts, having to make a leap, or perhaps several leaps, of faith in order to believe the rather banal fact that I had set out to prove.\"\n\nIn other words, when it comes to history, what you believe depends on what you are willing to believe.\n\nChristians may take some consolation in the fact that more than 2,000 years after his birth, Jesus Christ continues to stir up debate and controversy.\n\nMerry Christmas to all and to all a good night.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

Black market rhino horn sells for up to $60,000 (57,000 euros) per kilogram \u2014 more than gold or cocaine \u2014 and in the last eight years alone roughly a quarter of the world population has been killed in South Africa, home to 80 percent of the remaining animals.\n\nCITES estimates the illegal wildlife trade to be worth $20 billion (19 billion euros) a year, making it the fourth biggest illicit activity after guns, drugs and human trafficking.\n\nSome African countries have made the fight against poaching a priority, but others believe there are more important problems on which to spend scarce resources, such as ending conflict, poverty, unemployment or hunger.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s unfair just to leave it to African countries to take care of that problem, it\u2019s an international issue\u2026 and it applies to thousands of species across the planet,\u201d said Richard Vigne, director of the private Ol Pejeta conservancy in Kenya.\u00a0\n\nAs an example, with attention fixed on elephant and rhino and gorillas, there was widespread shock as it emerged this month that the humble giraffe had seen numbers plummet by 40 percent and was now also vulnerable to extinction.\u00a0\n\n\u2013 Good news \u2013\n\n\u201cThe good news is we now know what we have to do, but we have to multiply the scale of our actions,\u201d said Scanlon.\n\nPart of that is the increasing use of technology, intelligence and weaponry as well as coordination with customs and police services, the adoption of laws with heavy penalties for poachers and a growing number of cross-border agreements to halt trafficking.\n\n\u201cWe need a holistic approach. If we deploy armed rangers on the ground, we also need to reduce the demand for ivory and explain to local communities there is economic interest in protecting wildlife,\u201d primarily through tourism, said Andrew McVey of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).\n\nAcross Africa drones, night-vision equipment, helicopter-borne intervention teams, automatic weapons and special forces trainers are all being brought in to stop the poachers.\n\n\u201cThis is a war, this is an unfortunate part of conservation \u2026 We can\u2019t walk around in the bush with a stick, gently asking the poachers to drop their AK-47,\u201d said Damien Mander, an Australian ex-soldier who heads the International Anti-Poaching Foundation (IAPF).\n\n\u201cHumans are capable of reacting quickly and strongly if they have been pushed far enough in the corner. I don\u2019t think we are far enough in the corner to spark that reaction.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.44444465637207, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 862, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 7, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.33549683248, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161216060000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.55220417633411, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.0}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/11/07/doj-monitor-election-day-polls-28-states/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [788, 3325, 3472]}}, "headline": "DOJ to Monitor Election Day Polls in 28 States", "wordcount_as_scraped": 536, "date": "20161107210000", "story_content": "The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced it is deploying more than 500 personnel to monitor Election Day polls in 28 states, including three counties in Texas.\n\nState and local governments are responsible for administering elections but the DOJ says its Civil Rights Division is \u201ccharged with enforcing the federal voting rights laws that protect the rights of all citizens to access the ballot on Election Day.\u201d\n\nThe Civil Rights Division of the DOJ announced it will be \u201con the ground in 67 jurisdictions for compliance with the federal voting rights laws.\u201d The statement from the Department does not disclose how these jurisdictions were selected.\n\nIn a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said,\u00a0\"The bedrock of our democracy is the right to vote, and the Department of Justice works tirelessly to uphold that right not only on Election Day, but every day.\"\n\nIn Texas, Dallas and Harris Counties will be monitored, as well as nearby Waller County.

The rest were withheld as personal.\n\n___\n\n2:15 p.m.\n\nHillary Clinton is also making plans to air TV commercials in typically Democratic Michigan and New Mexico.\n\nHer campaign said Tuesday it will spend more than $100,000 on TV commercials in each of the two states. That announcement came shortly after Republican Donald Trump\u2019s campaign said it would be advertising there.\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign earlier confirmed it will be advertising in Colorado for the first time since July. And it also is deploying ads in Virginia for the first time since early August.\n\nClinton spokesman Jesse Ferguson said the Trump campaign sees a path through these states, but \u201cwe\u2019re going to make sure those doors remain shut.\u201d\n\nTrump has to win some traditionally Democratic states to secure the 270 electoral votes needed for the presidency.\n\n___\n\n1:15 p.m.\n\nDonald Trump is making a surprise stop at a local outpost of a beloved Pennsylvania-based convenience store chain.\n\nTrump briefly visited a Wawa in King of Prussia. He stopped by after a speech attacking President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul.\n\nThe Republican presidential nominee wandered the store for a few minutes and posed for selfies with a trio of customers. He did not purchase anything.\n\nHe was joined by staffers, his daughter Tiffany and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway.\n\nTrump has made several recent stops in the Philadelphia suburbs, a vote-rich area crucial to winning Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Republican\u2019s campaign has doggedly tried to win the state, but has consistently trailed in the polls. Pennsylvania last went for a Republican presidential candidate in 1988.\n\n___\n\n1 p.m.\n\nThe latest Wikileaks release reveals that the Clinton campaign looked to neuter the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee as far back as December.\n\nAmong the options discussed in the hacked campaign documents was forcing the chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, out of office after the party\u2019s convention.\n\nOther options outlined in a memo by top campaign aide Heather Stone would have kept Wasserman Schultz in place, but in a weakened capacity.\n\nThe memo urged \u201csystemic shifts at the DNC leadership level\u201d to help Hillary Clinton win the presidency.\n\nWikileaks has been releasing thousands of hacked emails from campaign chairman John Podesta.\n\nWasserman Schultz announced her resignation just before the convention last summer after an earlier Wikileaks hack of party emails showed party officials had favored Clinton over challenger Bernie Sanders.\n\n___\n\n12:25 p.m.\n\nDonald Trump says that if he becomes president, he\u2019d immediately convene a special session of Congress to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nTrump delivered what his campaign billed a major speech Tuesday about President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul. He spoke in the Philadelphia suburbs, which are crucial to his hopes of winning Democratic-leaning Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump said Obamacare was \u201ca catastrophe\u201d and has to be replaced \u201cvery, very quickly.\u201d\n\nHe said if it isn\u2019t replaced, \u201cwe will destroy American health care forever.\u201d\n\nTrump left the detailed criticisms of the program to Mike Pence, his running mate.

New Mexico voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.\n\nTrump needs to capture some traditionally Democratic strongholds, but surveys suggest that will be difficult.\n\n___\n\n11:20 a.m.\n\nA lawyer for Huma Abedin says the Hillary Clinton aide has always cooperated with State Department and FBI requests for information.\n\nAttorney Karen Dunn said in a statement Tuesday that Abedin has been interviewed for hours and has provided records that are related to work and are potentially related to work.\n\nDunn said Abedin learned from media reports on Friday that a laptop belonging to her estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, might contain emails of hers. The FBI is examining whether the emails are pertinent to its dormant investigation of Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server.\n\nThe attorney said Abedin has not been contacted by the FBI about this, but that she\u2019ll continue to be forthcoming and cooperative.\n\n___\n\n10:15 a.m.\n\nThe Hillary Clinton campaign is back on the air in Colorado.\n\nThe campaign had suspended its television advertising in the battleground state in July. It was taken as a sign of confidence that she had the state locked up.\n\nHer campaign says Clinton is returning to Colorado\u2019s airwaves with a six-figure buy. That comes as polls are tightening, but Colorado Democrats are dominating early voting.\n\nColorado is also home to two competitive congressional races. Clinton\u2019s return to the airwaves could help Democrats oust two Republican incumbents.\n\n___\n\n9:10 a.m.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan says he\u2019s voted for Donald Trump, but he\u2019s still not going to campaign with him.\n\nRyan said Tuesday on Fox News\u2019 \u201cFox and Friends\u201d that he used early voting to cast his ballot for the Republican presidential nominee last week.\n\nTrump is campaigning Tuesday in Ryan\u2019s home state of Wisconsin, but the speaker won\u2019t be joining him. Ryan said he hadn\u2019t been aware of Trump\u2019s travel plans until 10 minutes before the Fox interview and would be in Indiana then. Trump\u2019s travel plans had been announced at least a day in advance.\n\nRyan and Trump have had a rocky relationship and Ryan has previously said he wouldn\u2019t campaign for Trump.\n\nBut Ryan said \u201cwe\u2019ve worked with our nominee\u201d on health care, national security, tax reform and other policy proposals.\n\n___\n\n3:55 a.m.\n\nHillary Clinton is not the only one playing defense after the FBI\u2019s disclosure last week of additional emails relevant to its probe of her use of a private email server. Other Democrats are under the gun in dozens of down-ballot races that will determine who controls the House and Senate next year.\n\nTo the extent the fortunes of down-ballot Democrats rise and fall with Clinton, it\u2019s a worrisome development for the party.\n\nBut the flare-up gives Republicans, many of whom have been repeatedly on the defensive over a slew of controversies involving GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, a chance to go on offense.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.636942684650421, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1178, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.0748244591400002, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161101220000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.0, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.8675721561969398, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2017/01/05/exclusive-uk-maritime-borders-porous-protections-dismantled-top-security-expert/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [394, 2093, 2102, 2399, 2956, 3571, 3573], "\u00a3": [3484, 3578, 3601]}}, "headline": "UK Maritime Borders \u2018Porous\u2019, Protections \u2018Dismantled\u2019 \u2013 Top Security Expert", "wordcount_as_scraped": 553, "date": "20170105190000", "story_content": "The former head of the Borders Unit at the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the world\u2019s largest intergovernmental security organisation, says \u201csuccessive governments have dismantled the layered mosaic of border security\u201d which once protected Britain\u2019s coast.\n\nHenry Bolton, who served as an\u00a0army intelligence officer and police detective before becoming arguably the foremost border security expert in the United Kingdom, spoke exclusively to Breitbart London after terror watchdog David Anderson warned that the country\u2019s \u201csmaller south and east coast ports, marinas and landing places\u201d are vulnerable to \u201creturning foreign fighters or other terrorists\u201d from extremist organisations such as Islamic State.\n\n\u201cDavid Anderson is absolutely right when he says that our maritime borders are porous\u201d, Bolton agreed, citing factors such as the erosion of the Coastguard, which once passed information to the authorities through a network of hundreds of permanently-manned and auxiliary stations, but now operates from a small and ever-shrinking handful of Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centres.\n\nBolton also raised concerns about the diminishing \u201clegal responsibilities of harbour masters to monitor, record and report vessel movements\u201d at the many ports, piers, and jetties which ring the British coastline.\n\nLast April, the Leave.EU campaign smuggled a group of \u201cmigrants\u201d across the Channel from Gravelines in France to Folkestone Harbour in just two and a half hours, \u201ctotally unopposed\u201d and in \u201cbroad daylight\u201d, to highlight the seriousness of the situation.\n\n\u201cThis is Folkestone Harbour,\u201d announced the pilot as he disembarked. \u201cNo harbour master, no police, no customs, no nothing.\u201d\n\nBolton attributed the blame to Britain having \u201cno comprehensive multi-agency border strategy\u201d and the \u201cswingeing cuts\u201d which have \u201ccrippled the capability and morale of the UK Border Force\u201d.\n\nLast June, shortly after a rare catch of a pair of Iranian migrants who crossed the Channel successfully, it was\u00a0revealed\u00a0that the Border Force had just three cutters available to patrol almost 8,000 miles of coastline. Italy, by contrast, has around 600 craft monitoring a coastline which is less than 5,000 miles long.\n\nAlarm bells have previously been raised by Admiral Lord West, former head of the Royal Navy, and\u00a0David Bolt, Chief Inspector of Borders, among others.\n\nWhile the threat from drug-smugglers, gun-runners, and people-traffickers is particularly acute, Bolton was at pains to point out the more general implications with respect to large-scale illegal immigration, exacerbated by European Union (EU) regulations. The bloc\u2019s rules make it very difficult to deport migrants who arrive after mounting illegal sea crossings, forcing their way on to lorries or even storming the Channel Tunnel.\n\nBolton singles out the Dublin III regulations in particular. These\u00a0prevent the UK from simply deporting migrants who arrive via safe countries, unless it can be determined which EU country they first arrived in and what their country of origin is. Many migrants refuse to divulge the relevant information and destroy their passports. Consequently, only 14 out of several thousand illegal arrivals could be sent back to France in 2014.\n\nThe issue raises questions about the priorities of the Conservative government, which is led by politicians who campaigned to Remain in the EU. The party cut \u00a336 billion from UK public spending in 2010-15 alone, assisted by the Liberal Democrats\u00a0\u2013\u00a0but \u00a385 billion (gross) or \u00a342 billion (net) in membership contributions was handed to the EU over the same period.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 4, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.8414025306701705, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 546, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.7574092523799996, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170105190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.677655677655681, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/01/24/net-neutrality-critic-ajit-pai-named-new-fcc-chairman/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 656, "scraper_regex": 710}}, "headline": "Net Neutrality Critic Ajit Pai Named New FCC Chairman", "wordcount_as_scraped": 710, "date": "20170124140000", "story_content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump has picked a fierce critic of the Obama-era \u201cnet neutrality\u201d rules to be chief regulator of the nation\u2019s airwaves and internet connections.\n\nIn a statement Monday, Ajit Pai said he was grateful to the president for choosing him as the next chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. Several reports last week had said he was the pick.\n\nPai had been one of the two Republican commissioners on a five-member panel that regulates the country\u2019s communications infrastructure, including TV, phone and internet service.\n\nThere are currently just three members on the panel. The Republicans\u2019 new majority at the FCC, along with their control of Congress and the White House, is expected to help them roll back policies applauded by consumer advocates that upset many phone and cable industry groups, including net neutrality rules that bar internet service providers from favoring some websites and apps over others.\n\nPai, an active Twitter user, posted Monday that \u201cthere is so much we can do together to bring the benefits of the digital age to all Americans and to promote innovation and investment.\u201d\n\nAN INDUSTRY-FRIENDLY FCC\n\nPai has long maintained that the FCC under former Chairman Thomas Wheeler had overstepped its bounds, suggesting that he would steer the agency in a direction more favorable to big phone and cable companies. In a December speech, he expressed confidence that the 2015 net neutrality rules would be undone and said the FCC needed to take a \u201cweed whacker\u201d to what he considered unnecessary regulations that hold back investment and innovation.\n\nConsumer advocates have been concerned that a deregulation-minded FCC could potentially allow more huge mergers, overturn new protections for internet users and lead to higher costs for media and technology companies that rely on the internet to reach consumers.\n\nPai opposed online privacy regulations that force broadband providers to ask consumers for permission before using their data, saying they are more onerous than the requirements for internet companies like Google and Facebook.\n\nHe voted against approving Charter Communication\u2019s $67 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable and a smaller company, Bright House \u2013 not because he opposed the merger, but because he thought some of the conditions required by the FCC, like barring data caps on home internet service, amounted to government meddling in business.\n\nThe cable industry\u2019s trade group, the NCTA, supported Pai in a statement Monday that said he has a \u201ccommon-sense philosophy that consumers are best served by a robust marketplace that encourages investment, innovation and competition.\u201d Public Knowledge, a consumer advocacy group, said Pai had a \u201chistory of attacking consumer protections\u201d and urged him to keep the FCC\u2019s recent initiatives intact.\n\nThe Internet Association, a trade group that represents tech and video companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix, had said last week that while Pai doesn\u2019t always side with the internet industry, \u201che is both thoughtful and willing to listen.\u201d\n\nTO COME: PAI VS. THE ZERO RATING, MORE MERGERS?\n\nPai also criticized an FCC report on \u201czero rating\u201d earlier this month, characterizing it as a meaningless document that won\u2019t influence the FCC under Trump. The report, issued in the last days of the Obama administration, took issue with the way companies like AT&T and Verizon exempted their own video services from wireless data caps, effectively making them cheaper to stream on phones and tablets than rival services such as Netflix.\n\nFuture big media and telecom mergers may get a friendlier review under a Pai-led FCC. Pai voted to approve AT&T\u2019s 2015 acquisition of DirecTV.

Following the lead of many other colleges during earlier dates of the tour, UC Berkeley administrators have hit the College Republicans with an expensive and unexpected \"security fee\" for the event.\n\nThe College Republicans, however, are currently fighting back against the sudden security fee, and have provided Breitbart News with a copy of the letter that was sent to UC Berkeley Chancellor Nicholas Dirks.\n\n\"Dear Chancellor Dirks,\" wrote the College Republicans in their letter. \"On behalf of the Berkeley College Republicans (\"BCR\"), we write in response to the University's arbitrary and excessive, estimated $6,370 security fee demand for the Milo Yiannopoulos event in Pauley Ballroom on February 1st. In effect, the University is restricting BCR's constitutional rights to free expression on campus by charging fees for unsolicited security that amount to a tax on a \"controversial\" speaker. We are writing to request that this fee be waived in its entirety. The United States Supreme Court has held that \"state colleges and universities are not enclaves immune from the sweep of the First Amendment.\" Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 180 (1972).\"\n\n\"Upon information and belief, the security fee of this amount was issued by the administration as a de facto tax on the BCR's right to invite speakers to campus,\u201d they continued. \u201cIt is apparent that the $6,370-tax is specifically designed to prevent the BCR from successfully bringing Milo Yiannopoulos to the University. There can be no serious argument that a student group, like the BCR, can reasonably be expected to pay such a fee. In essence, the fee places an undue burden on the BCR's ability to invite conservative speakers to campus, such as Mr. Yiannopoulos, and thus, is violative of the U.S. Constitution. To the best of BCR's knowledge, the University has not imposed similar fees on other events.\"\n\n\"The BCR will not hesitate to seek all forms of relief available to it under the law, including injunctive relief in court, if the asserted fee is not eliminated in its entirety,\u201d concluded the letter. \u201cThe BCR is confident that you will assist it in resolving this matter amicably, and to the satisfaction of all parties involved.

Deaths of the more rare golden eagles would be allowed without penalty so long as companies minimize losses by taking steps such as retrofitting power poles to reduce the risk of electrocution.\n\nThe new rule will conserve eagles while also spurring development of a pollution-free energy source intended to ease global warming, a cornerstone of President Barack Obama\u2019s energy plan, said Fish and Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe.\n\n\u201cNo animal says America like the bald eagle,\u201d Ashe said in a statement.  He said the Fish and Wildlife Service is trying to balance energy development with eagle conservation.\n\nWind power has increased significantly since Obama took office, and wind turbines as tall as 30-story buildings are rising across the country. The wind towers have spinning rotors as wide as a passenger jet\u2019s wingspan, and blades reach speeds of up to 170 mph at the tips, creating tornado-like vortexes.\n\nThe surge in wind power has generally been well-received in the environmental community, but bird deaths \u2014 and eagle deaths in particular \u2014 have been a source of contention.\n\nThe birds are not endangered species but are protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The laws prohibit killing, selling or otherwise harming eagles, their nests or eggs without a permit.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what toll wind energy companies are having on eagle populations, although Ashe said as many 500 golden eagles a year are killed by collisions with wind towers, power lines, buildings, cars and trucks. Thousands more are killed by gunshots and poisonings.\n\nReporting of eagle mortality is voluntary, and the Interior Department refuses to release the information.\n\nThe Fish and Wildlife Service estimates there are about 143,000 bald eagles in the United States, and 40,000 golden eagles. Ashe called recovery of the bald eagle \u201cone of our greatest national conservation achievements.\u201d\n\nThe rule is set to take effect in mid-January, days before Obama leaves office.

He also praised a requirement for greater public reporting of data on the numbers of birds killed by wind turbines.\n\nPermits issued by the government would be reviewed every five years, and companies would have to submit reports of how many eagles they kill.\n\nTom Kiernan, CEO of the American Wind Energy Association, said the industry was still reading the final rule, but said wind companies \u201cstrongly support its core purpose \u2014 eagle conservation.\u201d\n\nThe industry is working to further reduce what he said was a \u201cminimal impact\u201d it has on eagles in hopes of \u201cmaintaining healthy eagle populations for generations to come,\u201d Kiernan said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.9769357442855802, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 543, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 10, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.01511344578, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161214200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.0515653775322304, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.0}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2016/12/08/feds-open-second-holding-facility-migrant-kids/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [839, 2823, 2862, 3100, 3106, 3596, 4152, 4437, 4837, 4850, 6369, 6839, 6855, 7210, 7371]}}, "headline": "Feds Open Second Holding Facility for Migrant Kids", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1151, "date": "20161208150000", "story_content": "Border Patrol officials and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) dignitaries were on hand for the opening of Texas' second temporary holding facility.\n\nThe facility is being opened to house the flood of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) and Family Unit Aliens (FMUA) migrating mostly from Central America.\n\nThe new facility is being opened near the Donna-Rio Bravo International Bridge.

The union, which represents the approximately 16,500 of our nation's Border Patrol agents, wrote that the agency deliberately scheduled the union's President Brand Judd to other duties, making it impossible for him to offer testimony on behalf of the agents he represents.\n\nBorder Patrol agents are being temporarily transferred from the Tucson, San Diego, and Del Rio Sectors to the McAllen and Weslaco Centralized Processing Centers. Their duty is\u00a0to increase the screening and processing of the unauthorized immigrants with a focus on UACs and FMUAs, she stated.\n\nNine days after the announcement of the Border Patrol agents\u2019 redeployment, officials announced the first opening of a temporary holding facility near the CBP Tornillo-Guadalupe Port of Entry. The facility is located about 40 miles east of El Paso, according to information obtained by Breitbart Texas.\n\nIn the month of October, the first month of the new fiscal year, the El Paso Sector captured 1,481 FMUAs and 626 UACs, Breitbart Texas\u00a0reported. The total number of apprehensions in the sector was reported to be 3,973. These numbers represent an increase in FMUA apprehensions of 457 percent over the same month the previous year. UAC apprehensions were up by 162 percent in the El Paso Sector.\n\nHHS officials announced\u00a0in late November that they are overwhelmed with the flood of immigrant children and families. To deal with the budgetary crisis, the department is stripping allocated funds from medical research and services for American citizens. During the last month alone, an average of 255 UACs per day were placed in the custody of the ORR after being processed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials,\u00a0according to\u00a0the Center for Immigration Studies Director of Policy Studies Jessica Vaughn.\n\nFor now, the department is making drastic cuts to health services for American citizens. Outgoing HHS Secretary Sylvia Matthews Burwell has directed that $167 million be cut from other programs to cover the costs of services for illegal immigrant minors through December 9 when the current continuing resolution expires, Vaughn wrote.\n\nPresident-Elect Donald Trump announced on November 29 that he will appoint Georgia Representative Tom Price to replace Burwell as HHS Secretary, Breitbart News reported. After being confirmed by the Senate, the new HHS Secretary will have to deal with this issue while also managing the next president's goal of repealing and replacing Obamacare\n\nDuring the month of October, the apprehensions of FMUAs increased by nearly 37 percent over September, according to information obtained from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials by Breitbart Texas. Those numbers have been increasing nearly every month leading up to the election since January. October also saw an increase in the apprehensions of UACs by nearly 19 percent. Those numbers also were increasing nearly every month during 2016. Total apprehensions of all illegal aliens crossing the border in October rose by nearly 17 percent.\n\nOf the total number of family units apprehended all along our southwest border with Mexico (13,124), 8,726 were apprehended in the RGV Sector. A total of 11,183 FMUAs were apprehended in Texas alone.\u00a0A total of 6,754 UACs were also apprehended in October. Of those, 65 percent (4,093) were apprehended in the RGV sector and 5,518 in all of Texas.\n\n\"The smugglers learned in 2014 that they could tie up Border Patrol agents as babysitters and keep us from our primary mission of stopping illegal border crossings and drug smuggling,\" U.S. Border Patrol Agent Chris Cabrera told Breitbart Texas in his capacity as president of National Border Patrol Council Local 3307 in\u00a0an interview on\u00a0October 26. \"When are we going to get back on the border?\"\n\n\"In 2014, it was primarily the Rio Grande Valley Sector that saw the massive numbers of families and children,\" Cabrera explained. \"Now we are seeing increases in every sector\u2013some as high as 200 percent.\"\n\nNew numbers for the month of November are expected to be reported next week.\n\nBob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

Only school board President Terry Delano voted against the continued ban of the Christmas display.\n\nAs reported by Breitbart Texas on Friday, a Texas school principal told the staffer she had to remove the part of a Charlie Brown Christmas decoration display that included a quote from Linus which included the word \"Christ.\u201d The quote was a message about the meaning of Christmas. Principal Kara Trevino was reported to have told the school staffer, Dedra Shannon, that it was \"an issue of separation of church and state.\"\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton responded by calling the principal\u2019s directive \"an attack on religious liberty and a violation of the First Amendment and state law.\" He urged, \"I am calling on the school board of the Killeen Independent School District (ISD) to immediately reverse their unlawful decision.\"\n\nPaxton\u00a0Texas voted for the \u201cMerry Christmas law\u201d when he was a Texas state legislator. He said, \u201cWe passed that law precisely because of this type of discrimination against people of faith. No school official in Texas can silence a Biblical reference to Christmas.\u201d\n\nPaxton pinned a letter (attached below) to the school board trustees before the meeting on Tuesday. In it he advises:\n\nBased on public comments, both the principal and Killeen ISD objected to the Christmas poster for fear that it violated the First Amendment and would lead to a lawsuit. Although these concerns are not surprising in an age of frivolous litigation by anti-Christian interest groups, they stem from an incorrect reading of the law. The U.S. Supreme Court has held repeatedly that neither \u201cstudents [n]or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.\u201d Staff members therefore may express their take on the holiday without infringing on the Constitution, even if they incorporate some religious terminology.\n\nThe \u201cMerry Christmas Law\u201d as it is referred to, was passed in 2013 to address such issues say opponents of the school and school district\u2019s actions.\u00a0Texas HB 308\u00a0amended Texas Education Code to\u00a0protect the right of students and teachers to celebrate Christmas and Hanukkah. Texas State Representative Dwayne Bohac\u00a0was the author of the \"Merry Christmas Bill.\"\n\nIn his letter to the school trustees, Paxton said that this law \u201cencourages school districts to take a more inclusive approach to religious and secular celebrations. The statute explicitly grants school districts the option of educating its students about traditional winter holidays, the meaning of these holidays, and how they are referenced in history and pop culture, which \u2018A Charlie Brown Christmas\u2019 certainly satisifies.\u201d\n\nThe Texas AG did not threaten the school district with litigation but told the trustees, \u201cRest assured that, should you comply with the law, my office will gladly exercise its discretion [under the Texas Education Code] to represent Killeen ISD in any frivolous litigation that might be filed that seeks to inhibit the religious expression and diversity of Killeen\u2019s educational community.\u201d\n\nShannon, a clinic aide at Patterson Middle School in Killeen ISD told Breitbart Texas before the school board meeting:\n\nI'm saddened that Killeen ISD forced me to remove my Charlie Brown Christmas display. I believe it is discriminatory to not allow Christians, like myself, to put up a display that is simply an expression of the story of Christmas. I hope the school board takes action to end this religious hostility and allows me to acknowledge Christmas without having my display censored.\n\nThe Charlie Brown Christmas door decoration bore the following quote from \"A Charlie Brown Christmas:\"\n\nFor unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior which is Christ the Lord. That's what Christmas is all about, Charlie Brown.\n\nRepresentatives from Texas Values, \"a non-profit organization dedicated to standing for faith, family, and freedom in Texas,\" and lawyer and president of the organization, Jonathan Saenz spoke at the school board trustee meeting.\n\nSaenz says:\n\nThe Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution states that 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.' It does not require 'separation of church and state,' a phrase that appears nowhere in the Constitution. Indeed, the idea that the Constitution requires 'separation of church and state' is incompatible with longstanding and perfectly constitutional practices, including the practice of asking schoolchildren to recite the Pledge of Allegiance each morning\u2014punctuated with the phrase 'one nation under God.\u2019\n\nHe also says that the school district\u2019s assertion that Ms. Shannon \u201cis impos[ing] [her] personal beliefs on students \u2026 evinces a gross hostility to religion.\" The Killeen ISD released a statement last Friday that said in part, \u201cOur employees are free to celebrate the Christmas and Holiday season in the manner of their choosing. However, employees are not permitted to impose their personal beliefs on students.\u201d\n\nThe school district\u2019s stated legal position on the issue is that, \u201cit is clear that this display was not in keeping with the Merry Christmas Bill (House Bill 308), which requires that a display not encourage adherence to a particular religion.\u201d\n\nIn a statement released after the vote, Texas Values founder and legal counsel Jonathan Saenz said:\n\nTonight the Killeen ISD has decided to defy its own community, legal experts, our Texas Attorney General, and numerous state elected officials by voting to support the tearing down of a Charlie Brown Christmas poster in a public school. This attack on religious freedom and refusal to acknowledge clear federal and state law specifically on this issue is incredibly reckless and has placed the school board in a very dangerous legal position and an island by themselves.\n\nSaenz held a press conference after the school board vote:\n\n\n\nLana Shadwick\u00a0is a writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

There was no U.N. monitoring of the exit routes.\n\nDuring similar, previous halts in fighting, rebels and civilians in eastern Aleppo also mostly stayed put, saying international monitors were not involved and there were no guarantees of security for those who left. Some battle-hardened residents believe the government would arrest anyone who comes out through the corridors.\n\nAbout four hours before the pause expired, Syrian state media said seven mortar shells from the rebel-held territory hit one of the corridors in the northern part of the city.\n\nThe two Russians were slightly wounded during the shelling, and they were evacuated, but their lives were not in danger, the Russian Defense Ministry said. A correspondent for a pro-government broadcaster also was wounded by shrapnel, Syrian state TV said.\n\nThe government of President Bashar Assad largely abided by the halt. Russia, a staunch ally, has been supporting Syria\u2019s fight against the rebels with a campaign of airstrikes as recently as September and October.\n\nThe \u201chumanitarian pause\u201d by Russia raised speculation that a major offensive might begin after its expiration at 7 p.m. (1700 GMT; 1 p.m. EDT). There were no immediate reports of any new airstrikes there.\n\nU.N. officials in Geneva would not comment directly on the Russian initiative but reiterated that security conditions were not adequate for bringing aid into eastern Aleppo. The U.N. stepped up calls for a nationwide truce in the civil war, not just in the northern city.\n\nAsked whether the Russian plan offered a window of opportunity for aid convoys, spokesman Jens Laerke of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs told reporters: \u201cI\u2019m trying my best not to comment on the actual initiative, but to state what the situation is.\u201d\n\nJessy Chahine, a spokeswoman for U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura, added that anything that helps save lives \u201cis more than welcome.\u201d\n\nBut she added that de Mistura was against the evacuation of civilians \u201cunless it is voluntary.\u201d\n\nAleppo, Syria\u2019s largest city and once its commercial hub, has become one of the biggest theaters of the civil war, where eastern districts have been controlled by rebels opposed to President Bashar Assad and western areas have been controlled by the government. The eastern part has been besieged by pro-government forces since July, and the U.N. estimates that 275,000 people are trapped there.\n\nThe previous halt faltered because the Syrian government and Russia refused to allow humanitarian aid into blockaded area. This time, the U.N. was not part of the announcement or the operation of the corridors.\n\nMeanwhile, a rebel offensive began last week on the government-held areas, home to more than 1 million people, including some displaced from the rebel side. A volley of missiles killed 12 civilians Thursday, state media said.\n\nOvernight, the Syrian military dropped leaflets on the eastern side urging residents and rebels to leave during the pause in fighting, and one posted online by activists gave instructions on how to leave safely, with hands raised. Residents also reported getting text messages urging them to get out.\n\nThere has been no official word from Russia on what will happen after the halt in hostilities expires. Similar pauses ended last month with no resumption of airstrikes, which Russia said it had halted in eastern Aleppo. Some residents later reported bombardment on the front line with western districts.\n\nOn Thursday, a Russian lawmaker told the Interfax news agency that a \u201cpurge\u201d of eastern Aleppo would begin if the pause produced no results. President Vladimir Putin urged opposition fighters to leave via the corridors.\n\nRussia\u2019s aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov, is in the Mediterranean and headed for the Syrian coast. Its presence suggests that Russia may be intending to escalate its assault on the rebels.\n\nA rebel spokesman, Yasser al-Youssef of the Nour el-Din el-Zinki group, said opposition fighters are anticipating a \u201cviolent air campaign\u201d in eastern Aleppo.\n\n\u201cThe Russians are exerting more pressure on the rebellious people of Aleppo to get them out of the city,\u201d al-Youssef told The Associated Press. \u201cThis will not happen. Absolutely.\u201d\n\nSyrian state TV showed buses parked in one of the corridors waiting for anyone leaving eastern Aleppo. Police and an Islamic cleric also were at the crossing.\n\nNo one had used the corridors by midday, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, and a Civil Defense volunteer in Aleppo, Ibrahim al-Haj, added that no had left in the early afternoon.\n\nConcern about civilian safety was mounting amid a \u201clooming threat of a resumption and a possible escalation of the fighting\u201d after the humanitarian pause, Amnesty International said.\n\n\u201cThe scale of the devastation in eastern Aleppo in recent months has been chilling,\u201d said Samah Hadid of Amnesty\u2019s Beirut office. \u201cGiven the track record of the forces fighting in Aleppo \u2014 particularly government forces \u2014 Amnesty International fears there will be very high civilian casualties as Syrian forces, supported by Russia, escalate attacks in order to seize control of the city.\u201d\n\nA temporary pause \u201cis no substitute for unfettered and impartial humanitarian access and ensuring protection of civilians in the longer term,\u201d Hadid said.\n\nArmed groups have also put civilians at risk in western districts \u201cfrom the repeated, unlawful use of imprecise explosive weapons,\u201d Hadid added.\n\nOutside the city, warplanes continued to target rebel supply lines in western parts of Aleppo province, according to al-Youssef of the Nour el-Din el-Zinki group.\n\nMissiles were fired on the towns of Urem al-Kubra and Kfar Naha, wounding several people, the Qasioun news agency reported. Video from Urem al-Kubra showed women and children running amid a blanket of white dust and wrecked homes and a grocery store.\n\nAirstrikes also hit the western town of Atareb, about 24 kilometers (15 miles) from the city of Aleppo, killing at least three children, according to the activist site Aleppo Today TV and the Revolutionary Forces of Syria.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Albert Aji in Damascus, Syria, Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow and Jamey Keaten in Geneva contributed.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 10, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.049594402313231, "HarmVice": 20, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1019, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 5.791130294049999, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 20, "mft_sum": 45, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161104220000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 4.090909090909999, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 4.41609421000981, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2017/01/18/fake-news-california-violence-trump-inauguration/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [1716], "\u00a0": [77, 217, 267, 290, 341, 1214, 1324, 1598, 1739, 1976, 2044, 2058, 2277, 2307, 2344, 2347, 2481, 2704, 2872, 2926, 3370, 3388, 3415, 3579, 3737, 4095, 4133, 4141, 4184, 4186, 4196, 4238, 4240, 4249], "\u00e0": [1718]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 610, "scraper_regex": 671}}, "headline": "Fake News: Left, Media Predict Violence \u2014 and Blame Trump", "wordcount_as_scraped": 671, "date": "20170118170000", "story_content": "There they go again:\u00a0California Democrat operatives and activists are ginning up more \u201cfake news\u201d about violence they hope to blame on the election of Donald J.\u00a0Trump \u2014 and journalists are taking the bait.\n\nThe\u00a0Los Angeles Daily News\u00a0recently reported:\n\nthe Network Against Hate Crime\u00a0gathered for the second time since forming to discuss ways to prevent and respond to crimes motivated by race, religion, sexual identity and other prejudices.\n\"We know it's not just imagined,\" said Robin Toma, executive director for the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations.\nToma said national statistics show that acts of hate, bigotry, harassment and bullying increased a month after Nov. 8th presidential election. He also said there are reports by members of several communities who feel fearful as a result of Trump's rhetoric on the campaign trail and his stance on illegal immigration. Trump supporters have also been victimized, though not in large numbers, Toma noted.\n\nThe only problem with \"statistics\" is that they can be twisted to suit any purpose \u2014 especially when the existence of the category itself (i.e. \u201chate crimes\u201d) is highly politicized.\u00a0 The so-called \u201cnews story\u201d presents no causal analysis tying such acts of violence to Mr. Trump's election. \u00a0Similar to the narrative \u2014 alleging violence by Trump campaign supporters \u2014 pushed daily by the media during the general election.\n\nBut in the end, that turned out to be \"fake news\" too.\n\nIt turns out it wasn't Trump supporters who initiated violence on the campaign trail.\u00a0 It was Democrat activists and provocateurs \u2014 with orders from on high.\n\nAnd now with the inaguration looming, it\u2019s d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again. \u00a0Secret Service is preparing for \u201cunprecedented threats\u201d on Inauguration Day, while the media is pushing a narrative it\u2019s all Trump\u2019s fault.\n\nBut the facts tell a different story.\n\nThe left is gearing up for war, and hiring mercenaries. \u00a0According to the Washington Times, a group called Demand Protest, a\u00a0San Francisco\u00a0company that bills itself as the \"largest private grassroots support organization in the United States,\" posted identical ads Jan. 12 in multiple cities on Backpage.com seeking \"operatives.\"\n\n\"Get paid fighting against\u00a0Trump!\" says the ad.\n\nThere\u2019s\u00a0a pattern here.\n\nWhen the left wants\u00a0to\u00a0push a false narrative \u2014 in this case, fear of violence by Trump supporters on Inauguration Day \u2014 the media are willing accomplices. \u00a0But then they have to put aside journalistic integrity and ignore the overwhelming crescendo of information all over the Internet decrying that theory in favor of a much more sinister agenda by the anarchist left.\n\nBy only\u00a0covering which California Democrats are skipping the inauguration, they\u2019re ignoring the very real \u2014 albeit coded \u2014 threats of violence by dark operatives on the left. \u00a0Breitbart News has identified over 75 groups that are\u00a0connected to the #DisruptJ20 events, in a document titled \u201cTen Reasons to Go Hard on January 20,\u201d making the case to anarchists, socialist and communist ruffians from across the country about \"why would it be worth driving across the country to a city crowded with reactionaries and police.\"\n\nWhen you look at the group\u2019s website, all the images are apocalyptic:\n\nIf anyone is preparing for violence, it\u2019s the anarchist left, not the so-called\u00a0\u201chateful right.\u201d \u00a0They\u2019re not afraid of it. \u00a0They\u2019re provoking it, and planning it.\n\nAccording to a new undercover video by James O\u2019Keefe\u2019s Veritas Project, the goal is to \u201ccommit violence and create havoc\u201d \u2014\u00a0from using butyric acid stink bombs to interrupt the \u201cDeploraball\u201d the night before the inauguration, to \u201cturning the inauguration into a giant clusterf***,\u201d\u00a0thereby forcing its cancellation.\n\nThe media might do well to acknowledge that and cover this movement more closely \u2014 if only to differentiate between those who harbor deep concerns about, or have political differences with, the incoming administration on the one hand, and those who literally wish to burn it to the ground, on the other.\n\nTim Donnelly is a\u00a0Former California State Assemblyman \u2013\u00a0Author,\u00a0Patriot Not

"20170110010000", "story_content": "Minnesota has the highest rate of refugee tuberculosis (TB) per capita of any state in the country by a wide margin, with 4.08 cases of active TB diagnosed among refugees for every 100,000 residents in the general population\u00a0between 2012 and 2015.\n\nMinnesota is followed by Nebraska in the refugee TB per capita rate, where it is 1.26 per 100,000 residents; and North Dakota, where the rate is 1.19 per 100,000 residents.\n\nThis data comes from the same four Centers for Disease Control (CDC) annual publications titled Reported Tuberculosis in the United States which Breitbart News\u00a0reported earlier this month,\u00a0confirming that 1,565 refugees were diagnosed with TB between 2012 and 2015, more than three times what had been previously reported.\n\nIn many states, including Minnesota, the high refugee TB per capita rate explains why refugees who constitute less than one percent of the population accounted for significantly more than 20 times that percentage of all cases of TB diagnosed during the 2012 to 2015 period.\n\nIn Minnesota, 36 percent, or 225 out of 610 total cases of TB, were diagnosed in refugees, 55 times greater than the 0.7 \u00a0percent of the state\u2019s estimated population of refugees, by one measure.\n\nIn Kansas, 16 percent, or 25 out of 154 total cases of TB, were diagnosed in refugees, 112 times greater than the 0.14 percent of the state\u2019s estimated population of refugees.\n\nStates with high refugee TB per capita rates and high percentages of total TB attributable to refugees also accept a significant number of refugees from high TB burden countries.\n\nMinnesota, for instance, resettles a significant number of Somalis. Indiana resettles many Burmese. More than half of the 4,368 refugees resettled in New Hampshire since FY 2008 are from Bhutan, according to the State Department. Somalia, Burma, and Bhutan are all high TB burden countries.\n\nNationally, 4.5 percent of all TB cases diagnosed in the 46 states that reported this data were diagnosed in refugees. This percentage is 19 times greater than the percentage of the population that arrived as refugees between 2003 and 2015 (0.235 percent).\n\nThe 36,862 refugees that arrived in Minnesota during the 13 years between 2003 and 2015 accounted for less than one percent (0.7 percent) of the state\u2019s population of the state\u2019s 5.5 million population. The total refugee population in Minnesota, or any state, is probably greater than this 13 year refugee arrival number, due to refugees who arrived prior to 2003, as well as secondary migration from one state to another.\n\nRounding out the top ten states for active TB-diagnosed refugees per 100,000 residents are Iowa (1.02), Idaho (0.95), Georgia (0.94), New Hampshire (0.9), Indiana (0.87), Utah (0.87), and tied for tenth are Kansas (0.86), and Kentucky (0.86). Indiana, Wisconsin, Colorado, Ohio, and Maryland filled out the 11th to 15 positions, as shown in the table below, Refugee TB Per Capita, Top 15 States, 2012 to 2015.\n\nFour states and two cities did not provide the CDC with category breakdown for foreign-born residents who were diagnosed with TB by immigration status at arrival: Virginia, Washington, Illinois, Arizona, Washington, D.C., and New York City.\n\n\u201cState, county, and local public health agencies have the primary responsibility for preventing and controlling tuberculosis (TB) in their jurisdiction, and serve as the public health authority for TB, including the responsibility and authority for conducting TB surveillance,\u201d a spokesperson for the CDC told Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cThese TB control programs voluntarily share TB surveillance data with CDC through the National TB Surveillance System. Because state and local reporting capacity and privacy laws vary, the depth of data reported in CDC's national report also varies,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\n\u201cCDC encourages states/jurisdictions to provide as complete information as possible, but there is no requirement that they provide immigration status as part of routine surveillance,\u201d the spokesperson concluded.\n\nThe Virginia Department of Health and the Arizona Department of Health Services\u00a0told Breitbart News they do not track immigration status upon first arrival of foreign-born residents who contract TB. \u00a0As Breitbart News reported previously, slightly more than six percent of the foreign-born cases of TB diagnosed were categorized with refugee immigration status upon first arrival.\n\nThe Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) told Breitbart News that it does track refugees with TB, but did not report that information to the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nIDPH told Breitbart News that four cases of TB have been diagnosed in refugees resettled in the state of Illinois, but did not specify in which year or years those diagnoses occurred.\n\nThe Washington State Department of Health told Breitbart News that 11 cases of TB were diagnosed in refugees in 2015, but has not yet provided that data for 2012, 2013, or 2014.\n\nBreitbart News contacted public health authorities in New York City and Washington, D.C. to learn if they track refugee TB data and does not provide that information to the CDC, but has not yet received a response from either city.\n\nOne state, Tennessee, did not provide foreign-born TB data by immigration status upon first arrival in 2012 and 2013, but has subsequently provided that data in 2014 and 2015.\n\nSupporting tables are included below.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.64993023872375, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1161, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 2, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 12, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.39195357425, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170110010000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.5839793281653702, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2016/11/02/border-patrol-agent-assaulted-arrest-illegal-alien/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [993, 3410, 3483, 3644]}}, "headline": "Border Patrol Agent Assaulted During Arrest of Illegal Alien", "wordcount_as_scraped": 593, "date": "20161102150000", "story_content": "A U.S. Border Patrol agent was assaulted by an illegal alien he was attempting an arrest in southern California. The assault on the agent assigned to the Calexico Station caused an injury to his eye socket.\n\nThe Border Patrol agent observed a man illegally crossing the International Boundary fence at about 8:40 on Sunday night. After the illegal alien climbed over the fence, the agent made contact and attempted to arrest him, according to information obtained by Breitbart Texas from U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials.\n\nThe illegal alien struck the agent in the face with his elbow, officials stated. He reportedly struck the agent in the left orbital eye socket with his elbow and fled to avoid arrest. Despite being injured, the agent pursued the man and caught up with him again.\n\nThe illegal alien continued to fight, but the agent was able to subdue the man and place him in custody.\n\nIn addition to the contusion\u00a0to his left eye socket, the agent also suffered a laceration to his left elbow and a possible shoulder injury.\n\nThe illegal alien was arrested and turned over for possible prosecution for assault on a federal agent, a felony.\n\nJust one week earlier, another Border Patrol agent was assaulted in the same area of Calexico, Breitbart Texas reported. The Border Patrol agent, assigned to the Calexico Station (El Centro Sector) in southern California, responded to an alarm of an illegal border crossing near downtown Calexico. The illegal border crossing was detected by the Remove Video Surveillance System operators who monitor the border fence. The agent responded to the alarm and was attacked by the illegal alien, according to information obtained from U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials by Breitbart Texas. The agent was also struck by a concrete block thrown over the fence by others attempting to distract the agent. He was not seriously injured in the assault.\n\n\"Our agent thankfully only suffered minor injuries from this assault and was able to gain control of his attacker and make the arrest,\" Assistant Chief Patrol Agent David S. Kim said in a written statement about this week\u2019s attack. \"We will not tolerate assaults on our agents by criminals, and will vigorously pursue Assault on a Federal Officer prosecution against anyone who perpetrates such violence.\"\n\nBorder Patrol agents have told Breitbart Texas this is not necessarily true. Agents have said that unless an agent is severely injured, charges of assaulting the officer are often not prosecuted.\n\nEven when prosecuted and convicted, sentences handed down on these cases tends to be less severe than similar assaults on other law enforcement officers. Breitbart Texas reported in June about two Salvadoran illegal immigrants who were sentenced to 27 months and 63 months in prison for assaulting a Border Patrol agent in Texas.\n\nDuring the struggle the two illegal aliens attempted to choke the agent. They then reached for his sidearm and baton. Either of those weapons could have been used to take the agents life. Fearing for his life, the agent drew his pistol and fired at the illegal aliens. One was shot and the other fled.\n\nBorder Patrol agents are frequently assaulted by rock throwers from Mexico. This is the eighth attack on agents in the El Centro Sector since the new fiscal year began October 1. Breitbart Texas has\u00a0reported extensively on the frequent attacks on these agents.\n\nBob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security also appeared to be cutting back on information provided about all three of its law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe administration waited until the last Friday of the year to release its final FY 2016 report on Immigration and Customs Enforcement removal operations.\n\n\"It\u2019s no wonder that they waited for a day when hardly a soul was paying attention; the numbers for ICE are abysmal, even worse than 2015,\" Center for Immigration Studies Director of Policy Studies Jessica Vaughn reported this week. If there were an award for government reports that aim to obfuscate and spin, I would nominate this one.\"\n\nVaughn wrote that the annual reports have historically provided basic statistics from all three of the department's law enforcement agencies. This year, the report sneaked out by DHS officials on the last working day of the month normally, in two versions, was scaled back to provide only a fraction of the information normally disclosed. The reported is compiled by the Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS) which has a new director, Marc Rosenblum.\n\nVaughn listed the following as key findings from the annual report:\n\nOne of the priorities of the Obama Administration was supposed to be deporting criminal aliens and others designated under the Priority Enforcement Program introduced in November 2014. Breitbart Texas Managing Director Brandon Darby dubbed the program \"Catch and Release 2.0\" in an article published in January 2015.\n\n\"Before these changes,\" a federal agent with U.S. Customs and Border Protection told Breitbart Texas at the time, \"all illegal aliens arrested by Border Patrol were required to enter the deportation system where they would be scheduled for a deportation hearing at a future date. Under this new system, the illegal aliens are not even required to show up for a hearing ever.\"\n\n\"Not only are we releasing these people with no hearings scheduled, no notice to appear, but the DHS [Department of Homeland Security] is forcing Border Patrol to prepare the initial paperwork for the illegal aliens' work permits.\" The source added, \"Americans really need to think about the terrorism-related implications of this. Illegal aliens who are suspected of having terrorism ties, but not convicted, could be permitted to stay in the country.\"\n\nThe impact of the new program has been dramatic in a negative way. The charts below show the dramatic decline of interior deportations (called removals by the DHS) and the removal of criminal aliens from the U.S.:\n\n\n\n\n\nVaughn reported that 98 percent of all interior deportations were convicted criminals. This means that other migrants who have been crossing the border in massive numbers for the past several years are simply allowed to stay.\n\nEven though the removal of criminal aliens made up nearly all of the interior deportations, the numbers of criminals being deported also continued to fall from previous years. This is not because the country is running out of criminal aliens to deport.\n\n\"The main reason for the decline is the Obama administration\u2019s prioritization scheme that has steadily narrowed the types of cases that ICE officers are permitted to pursue.\n\nThe total number of removals (deportations and voluntary returns) increased by less than 5,000 in FY 2016 compared to FY 2015. However, the total deportation number of 240,000 aliens is 41 percent lower than the peak FY 2012 numbers.\n\n\"Obama has the lowest rate of deportations since the Nixon Administration,\" Vaughn stated. \"The administration and its allies frequently point out that more than two million removals have occurred since 2009, an accomplishment that they characterize as record-breaking.\"\n\nVaughn explains why this is not true:\n\nBut counting only removals as deportations presents a misleading picture of the level of enforcement. Removals are just one form of the deportation process that can be executed by any of the three DHS enforcement agencies (ICE, Border Patrol, and CBP officers at the port of entry). All three enforcement agencies also can process deportable aliens as a return (sometimes known as voluntary return), which is a lesser consequence. In general most border deportations are processed as returns and most interior deportations are processed as removals, but in recent years many more aliens apprehended at the border have been turned over to ICE for a brief period of detention and then removed in recent years, in a departure from the traditional \u201cyou catch \u2019em, you clean \u2019em\u201d policies, where the arresting agency typically handles the deportation process. In addition, illegal border-crossers who have been removed previously, or who are prosecuted for smuggling or other crimes are turned over to ICE for processing. Under these scenarios, the Border Patrol will count the case as an apprehension, which is their marquee enforcement metric, and ICE will count the case as a deportation.\nUnder Obama, a much larger number of Border Patrol cases were transferred to ICE for processing than had been the case under prior administrations. In 2008, the last year of the George W. Bush administration, just over a third of deportations credited to ICE were border cases, and two-thirds were interior cases. In 2016, more than two-thirds of the deportation cases credited to ICE were border cases, and less than a third were interior cases.\n\nRather than using removals as the measurement, Vaughn suggests that a more \"apples-to-apples\" comparison can be made by examining interior deportations and border removals separately. \"Neither the Border Patrol nor CBP publishes the total number of deportations executed, and many of the cases are transferred to ICE, so year-by-year comparisons of border deportations alone are impossible using open source statistics,\" she stated.\n\nUsing these methods, Vaughn concluded that the Obama Administration has completed a total of 5.3 million deportations (both interior and border removals. That number represents about half of those same actions under the administration of then-President George W. Bush. It is not the Obama Administration that holds the record for deportations. Rather, it is the Clinton Administration record with 12.3 million deportations reported.\n\nThe following chart provided by the CIS reveals the average number of deportations reported annually:\n\n\n\nVaughn was extremely critical of the content of the new annual report released by first-year Director Rosenblum. \"The first set of reports prepared under the tenure of new OIS Director Marc Rosenblum, formerly of the Migration Policy Institute, are of dubious value,\" she stated. She explained that the previous year's reported provided numerous data tables and explanatory materials providing a more neutral view of actions taken by the department. Typically, those reports would provide data covering multiple years for comparison.\n\n\"The new reports include only one set of actual enforcement statistics with only five numbers drawn from DHS systems \u2014 repeat,\u00a0five\u00a0enforcement statistics,\" Vaughn reported. \"Specifically, OIS is reporting: the number of inadmissibility determinations at the port of entry; the number of Border Patrol apprehensions; the number of ICE arrests, the number of book-ins to detention, and the total number of deportations. No numbers are provided for prior years, but percentage changes from 2015 are reported.\"\n\nVaughn concluded that the immigration issue will continue to be one of the most important and contentious policy matters facing the new President and his administration. \"The incoming Trump administration and Congress must insist that DHS return to a relatively standardized and apolitical manner of publishing the vital statistics of the immigration agencies in order to support this discussion.\"\n\nBob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

It also provides salaries directly from the Palestinian Authority budget to convicted Palestinian terrorists in Israeli prisons.\n\nCUFI states at its new website:\n\n\u2026the PA makes generous financial payments to terrorists. PA legislation actually requires these payments and specifies that the more Israelis (including other innocent bystanders) a terrorist kills, the more money the terrorist will receive. If the terrorist is killed or imprisoned, his family receives these payments. The sums involved are far more than most Palestinians could ever make through honest work.\nIn addition, the PA encourages violence by praising terrorists as \u201cmartyrs\u201d and \u201cheroes\u201d and naming its streets, stadiums and town squares after them. The PA delegitimizes Israel by denying the Jewish connection to the Land of Israel in its textbooks and on its television. The PA\u2019s recent lies about Israel\u2019s intentions on the Temple Mount have fueled the latest \u201cstabbing intifada.\u201dvar _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([\"embed\"]);\n\nTaylor Force was a Vanderbilt graduate student and U.S. Army veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan after graduating from West Point. He was murdered by a Palestinian terrorist on a stabbing rampage in Jaffa, Israel in March this year.\n\nThe proposed legislation \u2014 sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and several other Republican Senators \u2014 provides:\n\nFunds appropriated or otherwise made available for assistance \u2026\u00a0for the West Bank and Gaza may only be made available for such purpose if the Secretary of State certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that the Palestinian Authority\u2014\n(1) is taking credible steps to end acts of violence against United States and Israeli citizens that are perpetrated by individuals under its jurisdictional control \u2026\n(2) is publicly condemning such acts of violence and is taking steps to investigate or is cooperating in investigations of such acts to bring the perpetrators to justice; and\n(3) has terminated payments for acts of terrorism against United States and Israeli citizens to any individual who has been imprisoned after being fairly tried and convicted for such acts of terrorism and to any individual who died committing such acts of terrorism, including to a family member of such individuals.\n\nCurrent law already prohibits funds from being transferred to the Palestinian Authority under certain conditions, but the law allows that prohibition to be waived by the President of the United States for the interests of U.S. national security. The PA has also evaded that law by having payments routed to its creditors, or to the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Taylor Force Act makes no provision for a waiver or third parties, and requires Congress be satisfied that the PA is in compliance.\n\nIn a press statement, CUFI founder and Chairman Pastor John Hagee said:\u00a0\"Americans cannot support an entity that sponsors terrorism and incites violence. The Taylor Force Act isn\u2019t about Democrat vs Republican, it\u2019s about right and wrong. Every Member of Congress should back this legislation, and it should be one of the easiest decisions they make.\u201d\n\nCUFI Director David Brog added: \u201cWe cannot ignore the fact that when we send hundreds of millions of dollars to the PA we are subsidizing these terror payments. That\u2019s precisely why we must cut our aid to the PA until they stop funding terror. Doing so won\u2019t harm the prospects for peace. On the contrary, forcing the PA to renounce terrorism in both word and deed is a fundamental first step towards achieving peace. If Republicans and Democrats are looking for a bi-partisan issue on which to work together, stopping these payments is the perfect place to start.\u201d\n\nJoel B.

According to the Miami Herald, the remaining 10 Gitmo detainees \"are in war crimes proceedings at military commissions, six of them death-penalty tribunals.\"\n\nIn its December 8 decision to release Yemeni Yassin Qasim Muhammad Ismail Qasim, 37, Obama's parole-style PRB noted:\n\nHis responses [during his latest release hearing] were thoughtful and showed an effort to realistically consider the future. The Board also noted the detainee\u2019s extensive efforts to take advantage of opportunities in detention to better himself, to include multiple academic and art classes, as well as positive engagement with mental health counselors.\n\nPrior to being taken to the Guant\u00e1namo prison in May 2002, the Yemeni terrorist is believed to have fought against the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance, a coalition of mujahideen militias in Afghanistan where he received extensive combat training before his capture in 2001.\n\nA U.S. intelligence profile dated May 12 noted that Qasim \"probably retains extremist views and anti-US sentiment,\u201d adding that he \u201chad at least one relative who served as an AQAP [al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula] recruiter and jihadist ideologue as well as other associates who could help him re-engage in extremism if released.\"\n\nThe Yemen-based AQAP has been described as one of the strongest and most dangerous branches of al-Qaeda.\n\nMoreover, the U.S. intelligence profile noted in May that although he had not committed \"violent offenses\" in the last two years, \"he has been highly noncompliant with the guard force relative to other detainees\" during most of his time at Gitmo.\n\nFast forward about seven months to December 8, when Obama's PRB decided to clear Qasim for release after he had been designated too dangerous to liberate for years, according to the Miami Herald.\n\nIn its recent decision to release Qasim, who had reportedly been deemed a \"forever prisoner\" in March, the PRB noted:\n\nThe Board considered that the detainee no longer appears to be driven by extremist ideology, the detainee, has taken steps to sever ties with extremists, and the lack of any recent anti-US statements along with improvement in behavior.\nThe Board recommends resettlement to a GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] country with a strong rehabilitation and reintegration program and mental health access, consistent with the detainees stated preferences, with the appropriate security assurances as negotiated by the Special Envoys and agreed to by relevant USG department and agencies.\n\nGCC refers to a six-nation coalition of Gulf Arab states that includes war-ravaged Yemen's neighbors Saudi Arabia, its most powerful member, and Oman.\n\nIn Yemen, AQAP has expanded its reach and strength to unprecedented levels, according to the U.S. State Department.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter is mandated by law to provide Congress with 30 days notice of detainee transfers out of Gitmo.\n\nAccording to the latest U.S. government estimate, nearly three out of every 10 Guant\u00e1namo detainees who have been released are suspected or confirmed to have re-engaged in terrorist activities.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has criticized some of Obama's decisions to liberate Gitmo prisoners.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.8235294818878196, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 589, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.31110955471, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 3, "mft_sum": 12, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161215030000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.03735144312394, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.09090909091}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/12/17/tancredo-would-republican-establishment-consider-impeachment-to-block-trump-agenda/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [4519]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 795, "scraper_regex": 836}}, "headline": "Tancredo: Would Republican Establishment Use Impeachment to Block Trump Agenda?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 836, "date": "20161217180000", "story_content": "Several months ago I was asked what advice I would give to the Trump campaign.\n\nI said, only half joking, that he had better pick a vice presidential candidate the establishment hates more than it hates him. That would be his only insurance against impeachment. Those drums have already begun to beat, be it ever so subtly.\n\nIs anyone surprised how quickly the establishment that Donald Trump campaigned against has announced opposition to much of his policy agenda? No. But few understand that the passionate opposition includes a willingness to impeach and remove President Trump if he does not come to heel on his America First goals.\n\nFerocious opposition to Trump from the left was expected and thus surprises nobody. From the comical demands for vote recounts to street protests by roving bands of leftist hate-mongers and condescending satire on late-night television, hysterical leftist opposition to Trump is now part of the cultural landscape.\n\nBut those are amusing sideshows to the main event, the Republican establishment\u2019s intransigent opposition to key pillars of the Republican president\u2019s agenda.\n\nRepublican leaders in Congress are already sending Trump a subtle but clear warning: accept our business-as-usual Chamber of Commerce agenda or we will join Democrats to impeach you.\n\nIf you think talk of impeachment is insane when the man has not even been sworn into office yet, you have not been paying attention. Impeachment has been the goal of Democrats since the day after Trump won the election, and the Republican establishment will use the veiled threat as leverage to win concession after concession from the Trump White House.\n\nWhat are the key policy differences that motivate congressional opposition to the Trump agenda? There are at least four Trump campaign promises which, if not dropped or severely compromised, could generate Republican support for impeachment: Trump\u2019s Supreme Court appointments, abandoning the Trans Pacific Partnership, radical rollback of Obama regulatory projects, and real enforcement of our nation\u2019s immigration laws.\n\nOn regulatory rollback, Congress can legitimately insist on negotiating the details with Trump. But on the other three, immigration, the TPP, and Supreme Court nominees, Trump\u2019s campaign promises were so specific \u2014 and so popular \u2014 that he need not accept congressional foot-dragging.\n\nYet, while the President-elect \u2018s transition teams at the EPA, State Department and Education Department are busy mapping ambitious changes in direction, Congress\u2019s Republican leadership is busy doubling down on dissonance and disloyalty.\n\nAnd then, on the House side, we have the naysayer-in-chief, Speaker Paul Ryan, who refused to campaign with Donald Trump in Wisconsin, and who has vowed to obstruct Trump\u2019s most important and most popular campaign promise \u2014 an end to open borders and vigorous immigration law enforcement.\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that Trump\u2019s success or failure in overcoming the opposition to immigration enforcement will determine the success or failure of his presidency. If he cannot deliver on his most prominent and most popular campaign promise, nothing else will matter very much.\n\nSo, the bad news for President Trump is this: If he keeps faith with his campaign promises on immigration, for example to limit Muslim immigration from terrorism afflicted regions, which is within his legitimate constitutional powers as President, he will risk impeachment. However, his congressional critics will face one enormous hurdle in bringing impeachment charges related to immigration enforcement: about 90 percent of what Trump plans to do is within current law and would require no new legislation in Congress. Obama disregarded immigration laws he did not like, so all Trump has to do is enforce those laws.\n\nNow, if you think talk of impeachment is ridiculous because Republicans control Congress, you are underestimating the depth of Establishment Republican support for open borders.\n\nThe first effort in the 21st century at a general amnesty for all 20 million illegal aliens came in January 2005 from newly re-elected President George Bush. The \u201cGang of Eight\u201d amnesty bill passed by the US Senate in 2013 did not have the support of the majority of Republican senators, and now they are faced with a Republican president pledged to the exact opposite agenda, immigration enforcement. And yet, do not doubt the establishment will sacrifice \u00a0a Republican president to protect the globalist, open borders status quo.\n\nThe leader and spokesman for that establishment open borders agenda is not some obscure backbencher, it is the Republican Speaker of the House. Because the Speaker controls the rules and the legislative calendar, if he chooses to play hardball against Trump on immigration he can block any of Trump\u2019s other policy initiatives until Trump abandons his immigration enforcement goals.\n\nWhat all this points to is a bloody civil war within the Republican Party fought on the battlefield of congressional committee votes.\n\nDonald Trump won a electoral mandate to change direction and put American interests first, beginning with border security. If the congressional Republican establishment chooses to block the implementation of that electoral mandate, it would destroy not only Trump\u2019s agenda, it would destroy the Republican Party.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.542725086212161, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 795, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.32368070931, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 15, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 35, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161217180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.402515723270441, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.1818181818199998}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2017/01/20/trump-clamp-immigration-merit-based-system/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1786, 1795, 3458]}}, "headline": "Trump to 'Clamp Down' On Immigration Through 'Merit-Based' System", "wordcount_as_scraped": 568, "date": "20170120150000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 President-Elect Donald Trump's first act as president will reportedly be to \"clamp down\" on the country's immigration system and refugee resettlement program, while enforcing a \"merit-based\" method, focusing on skilled workers.\n\nIn a new piece by the LA Times, the west-coast newspaper says Trump will immediately focus on the broken immigration system, both legal and illegal, just as his campaign for president promised:\n\nGone will be the temporary protections of the final Obama years for people in the country illegally.

He may succeed where others have failed. However, he can make a more immediate contribution to peace by moving forward with his plans to move the U.S. embassy to Israel's capital, Jerusalem, on Day One of his presidency.\n\nPractically, many steps are involved in transferring the staff and security from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. But Ambassador David Friedman can immediately set up shop in the U.S. consulate in Jerusalem, raise the American flag and expunge all the nonsensical State Department rules that prohibit diplomats from treating Jerusalem like any other capital recognized by the United States (e.g., official cars are not allowed to fly the U.S. flag in the city). He can also immediately demand that the State Department fulfill the congressional mandate to allow all U.S. citizens born in Jerusalem to list Jerusalem, Israel, as their birthplace (as opposed to the Neverland that State insists they now come from).\n\nPresident Obama attended Shimon Peres' funeral on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem, Israel \u2014 or so we thought. The next day, however, the reference to Israel was \u201ccorrected\u201d\u00a0in the transcript of his remarks, so apparently Obama spoke in the Twilight Zone. But such trivialities and nonsense are unfortunately what we've come to expect from Obama's Middle East foreign policy.\n\nPresident Trump can once and for all end the confusion and hypocrisy by recognizing Israel's capital. I'm not sure how many people are even aware that of the 190 nations with which America has diplomatic relations, Israel is the only one whose capital is not recognized by the U.S. government.\n\nIn 1990, Congress passed a resolution declaring that \"Jerusalem is and should remain the capital of the State of Israel.\" Five years later, Congress overwhelmingly passed The Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995. This law reiterated that official U.S. policy should recognize Jerusalem as the undivided, eternal capital of Israel and required that the U.S. embassy in Israel be established in Jerusalem no later than May 1999. Unfortunately, the law included a waiver that allowed the president to ignore the legislation if he deemed doing so to be in the nation\u2019s best interests. Each president subsequently used that waiver to keep the embassy in Tel Aviv and making a mockery of the Congressional will.\n\nWhy have presidents from Clinton to Obama refused to execute the will of the Congress?\n\nTwo words: cowardice and coercion.\n\nEach president was frightened by State Department warnings that the Islamic world would rise up in protest and create a cataclysm in the Middle East that will spread to the United States. It is just one example of how State Department Arabists, who tried to prevent the creation of Israel in the first place, and have sought to weaken it ever since, have negatively influenced American policy.\n\nRather than stand up for democracy and the rule of law, these \"striped-pants boys,\" as Harry Truman called them, have for 70-odd years convinced presidents the sky would fall if they were too supportive of Israel.\n\nRefusing to move the embassy, like earlier failures to strengthen US-Israel ties, is nothing short of spinelessness. Trump's predecessors gave in to blackmail from Arab and Muslim leaders, the fictional \"Arab street,\" and terrorists. It may seem strange, but it's true: the most powerful nation in the history of the world, with the most formidable military ever seen, refused to recognize the capital of its greatest ally because it was blackmailed with threats of violence.\n\nBy contrast, throughout the campaign Trump demonstrated he could not be bullied by political opponents, the press or protestors. He now has the opportunity to stand up to some of the world's worst tyrants, as well as diplomats of the Obama State Department which he will inherit.\n\nWill the Middle East go up in flames if the U.S. embassy moves 40 miles down the road from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem?\n\nHello? Anyone notice that the Middle East has been on fire since at least the Arab spring? Are we foolish enough to believe that the Sunnis and Shiites killing each other throughout the region will stop fighting and mount a defense of Jerusalem against the \"sons of apes and pigs?\" Will ISIS, al-Qaeda and the rest of the radical Islamists turn their attention away from their Western enemies and their rivals in Syria, Iraq, Libya and elsewhere to Jerusalem, whose status as Israel's capital has not changed since 1967? Will radical Muslims who seek the destruction of the West because we are infidels become more radical because the US flag is flying over a building Jerusalem?\n\nThe notion is absurd.\n\nSome will say that there will be more terrorist attacks. Sorry to disabuse you of this notion, but they're already trying to kill us, and they're don't require further inspiration.\n\nOf course, the Palestinians are making bloodcurdling threats. Though it may be news to Secretary of State John Kerry, this has been going on since the 1920s, when the Mufti of Jerusalem regularly used the \"al-Aqsa mosque is in danger\" libel to provoke riots against Jews. The same lie was used by Yasser Arafat and repeatedly by Mahmoud Abbas. And, in case Kerry missed the news, the way he misses Iran flouting the catastrophic nuclear deal, four beautiful young Israelis \u2014 three women and one man ages 20 to 22 \u2014 were run over and killed by a truck in Jerusalem on January 8, even though the embassy remains in Tel Aviv.\n\nAmericans don't like to believe that religious wars exist anymore even though we can read about them every day in the newspaper reports about the slaughter going on in the Middle East. The Palestinian-Israeli dispute has always had a religious element and it has only grown stronger as Palestinians have become radicalized and adopted the genocidal goals of the most extreme Muslims, such as the leaders of Hamas and the mullahs of Iran who openly call for Israel's destruction.\n\nFor the last eight years, Obama has refused to utter the words \"radical Islam\" because he is unwilling to fight back against those who have declared war on our way of life. President-elect Trump has shown he is not afraid of upsetting the people who hate us because of who we are and not what we do.\n\nMoving the embassy is not just a matter of standing up to bullies and diplomats who believe they know what's best for the people of Israel. No \u2014 moving the embassy is also an essential first step toward peace. Recognition of a united Jerusalem as Israel's eternal capital should disabuse the Palestinians of the fantasy that the city will ever be divided again or that they will have sovereignty over any part of the city, let alone the holiest places in Judaism.\n\nTheir rights to pray at their holy places will not be infringed upon, as they are not now, and Palestinians living in Jerusalem who wish to become Israeli citizens (already a growing number) will enjoy all the rights they are now denied by the Palestinian Authority \u2013 freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, women's rights and LGBT rights.\n\nPalestinians, unlike many of their supporters outside the Middle East, actually understand that they will live better lives under Israeli rule than they ever could in a Palestinian state. That is why polls of Jerusalem Arabs show that majorities would prefer to live in Israel over a Palestinian state.\n\nOnce the embassy is moved, and the Trump administration makes clear that Jerusalem's sovereignty is not negotiable, it will be possible to discuss an end to the dispute that will ensure Israel's peace and security and allow Palestinians greater political autonomy but without the possibility of creating yet another terror state that threatens Israel's existence.\n\nSome people will be unhappy by the embassy move, but no other place on earth is treated as hypocritically as Jerusalem. It is a holy city, but so are many others whose sovereignty is not questioned. Jerusalem has never been the capital of any Arab or Muslim, state while its Jewish history stretches back 3000 years to King David.\n\nJerusalem is the center of Jewish life, the place generations of Jews dreamed of seeing and, even today, is the object of veneration of Jews around the world. It is the eternal capital of the Jewish State of Israel, and soon-to-be President Trump should waste no time declaring that the United States recognizes this straightforward history and these undeniable facts.\n\nShmuley Boteach, \"America's Rabbi,\" whom the Washington Post calls \"the most famous Rabbi in America,\" has just published The Israel Warrior: Standing Up for the Jewish State from Campus to Street Corner.

Now that the people have spoken, it is essential that\u00a0elected officials work together to address the enormous challenges facing our nation.\nI look forward to working with the new administration to ensure that we secure our border, restore the balance of power between the states and the federal government, and end\u00a0the federal overreach that has unfortunately become a staple of the outgoing executive's legacy.\nHere in\u00a0Texas, we will continue to fight for conservative, limited government principles that create economic opportunity and prosperity for all.\n\nLieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, who headed up Trump's nearly ten point win in Texas, joined in the celebration of the election of our 45th President:\n\nThis is a great night for our country and a great night for Texas. It is a new day in America. Change is finally coming to Washington. The voices of voters who have been ignored by the Washington establishment, the Democrat establishment and the media establishment, finally were heard loud and clear.\nWhat we are seeing tonight is what I saw campaigning with Trump \u2013 that he understands a lot about the heart and soul of America. The Democrats and Hillary obviously haven\u2019t got a clue.\nvar _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([\"embed\"]);Texans will now have a good friend in the White House who will be our partner in securing the border. We'll have a good friend in the White House who won\u2019t fight our energy industry and will put us on the road to energy independence. We have a good friend in the White House who will support school choice for every child, who will stand up for life, for liberty and the Second Amendment. And for the first time since 2008, we won\u2019t have a White House that we have to constantly sue to protect the rights of Texans.\nTrump had a great victory in Texas. Once again, we saw that despite the usual Democrats\u2019 brash talk, they are not going to turn Texas blue \u2014 they are not even going to turn it purple.\nTexas stands as a beacon for the nation reflecting the very best of what America can be.\n\nTexas' senior senator, John Cornyn (R-TX), joined in celebrating Mr. Trump's victory:\n\nI want to congratulate President-elect Trump on his remarkable victory after one of the most hard-fought elections in recent memory. As this election made clear, Texans and all Americans are understandably concerned for our country and the direction we're headed.\nThe\u00a0threat posed by radical Islamic terrorism is real and growing, as Texans were reminded just this week. Obamacare continues to implode as Texas families face higher costs and fewer choices for coverage. And nearly eight years of President Obama's draconian regulatory regime has suffocated job creators and hamstrung an underperforming economy.\nThe American people have delivered a resounding message that they're ready for change, and eager for Republicans to tackle the big challenges\u00a0facing our nation. I look forward to working with President-elect Trump to address the critical issues Texans and the American people have entrusted us to solve.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz (R-TX) who ran against the President-Elect during the Republican Primary expressed his congratulations and support for Mr. Trump:\n\nI congratulate President-elect Trump on an amazing victory for the American worker. This affirms what we have long known, that Americans have resoundingly rejected the Obama-Clinton agenda of bigger government, intrusive regulation, executive overreach, and lawlessness that is killing innovation and jobs, squandering opportunity for working men and women, marginalizing our freedoms, and compromising our security.\nThis election astonished the pundits. This was a change election. Americans voted for Republicans because of a promise to go to Washington to reverse our current course, and end the Washington cartel \u2014 a promise to drain the swamp. Now is the time to follow through on those words with action. We cannot wait even one day to begin implementing a conservative agenda that fulfills those commitments.\nI look forward to working with the new administration to confirm conservative justices from the strong list of 21 jurists that was promised. I look forward to working with the new administration to repeal Obamacare, to once and for all secure the border and enforce our immigration laws, and to take action that will rebuild our military and stop radical Islamic terrorists from infiltrating our homeland.\nI am eager to help lead the fight in the Senate to pass the conservative agenda that President-elect Trump promised to the American people.\nCharting a course to recovery will not be easy, it will take resolve and commitment to undo the havoc wreaked on our country the last eight years. But the future of America is worth it. Defending freedom and preserving the Constitution is worth it.\n\nU.S. Representative-Elect Jody Arrington, elected Tuesday night to serve the Lubbock-Abilene area in Congress, was also quick to congratulate Mr. Trump.\n\nCongratulations to Donald Trump on becoming the next President of the United States! As the next Congressman from District 19, I look forward to working with him to restore America's greatness, and return the power back to WE THE PEOPLE.\nThe message from the American people is loud and clear: We are fed up with Washington and career politicians. We don't want business as usual. We want a leader who will fix our problems and not just talk\n\nBob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

The invader was shot and killed by the homeowner.\n(Dec. 28, 2015) A Bucks County, Pennsylvania, resident shot an intruder who broke through the glass door on her apartment.\n(Dec. 29, 2015) A home invader was shot and killed after a pregnant woman helped fight him off.\n(Dec. 30, 2015) A pastor shot a man who attacked him inside the church.\n(Dec. 30, 2015) A Texas fireworks stand owner used a gun to shoot and stop armed robbers.\n(Jan. 9, 2016)\u00a0Four armed robbers stormed a women's gun store in Shawnee, Kansas, and the co-owner's life was spared when her husband intervened by opening fire on the suspects.\n(Jan. 10, 2016) A California homeowner survived an initial attack by a home invader, retrieved gun, and held the suspect at gunpoint until police arrived.\n(Jan. 11, 2016) A man put a gun to a Papa John's Pizza delivery woman's head; she pulled her own gun and shot him in the face.\n(Jan. 12, 2016) An armed robber in a Milwaukee barber shop was shot and killed by a patron with a concealed carry license/handgun.\n(Jan. 13, 2016) An armed Taco Bell robber ordered would-be victim to drop his pants, but the victim pulled his gun instead and shot the robber dead.\n\nThe NYT\u2019s claims that it is \u201cfantasy\u201d to think concealed permit holders can stop shootings and that it is \u201cmyth\u201d that concealed carry guns are used for self-defense are not new. The NYT\u00a0made very similar claims on October 26, 2015 and was\u00a0aided, at that time, by a companion piece in\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0which claimed\u00a0that .0002266% of concealed permit holders have been accused of a mass shooting. The WaPo suggested that such accusations against .0002266% of permit holders proves concealed carry makes Americans less safe.\n\nBut an armed citizen at the Orlando Pulse could have stopped or at least lessened that attack in the same way that the concealed permit holder stopped the March 22, 2015, attack at the Philadelphia barbershop. An armed citizen at the December 2, 2015, San Bernardino attack would have stopped or least lessened the severity of that vicious shooting spree. And armed citizens could have stopped or at least lessened the severity of the November 13, 2015, Paris attack that killed 130.\n\nRegarding Paris, Trump said:\n\nOne of the things I bring up, and I bring it up all the time, is the Second Amendment. Because, when you look at that slaughter that took place\u2013Paris is one of the toughest guns zones, you can't have a gun. France also, you can't have a gun. It's virtually impossible to get one. And you look at those places where it was carnage, it was horrible; a horrible thing to watch and a horrible thing to see\u2026.I can tell you, if people in that room\u2013some of them, you don't need too many\u2026[if they had had guns] they would have had a couple of killings but it wouldn't have been the good buys, it would have been the bad guys.\n\nSo Trump supports national reciprocity. It is a way to be sure there are more concealed carry permit holders in more places, ready and able to defend their lives and the lives of their fellow Americans. The NYT\u00a0says this puts \u201cpublic safety\u201d at risk.\n\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of \"Bullets with AWR Hawkins,\" a Breitbart News podcast.

Following Sanger's training as a nurse, her work alongside labor organizers, anarchists, socialists and other progressives and eventually her devotion to the cause of legalizing contraception, the film examines the risks she took and the impact she had that lasts to the present day.\n\nThe back cover of the book, published by Harper Collins, says about Sanger:\n\nThis complex, enigmatic revolutionary was at once vain and charismatic, generous and ruthless, sexually impulsive and coolly calculating\u2014a competitive, self-centered woman who championed all women, a conflicted mother who suffered the worst tragedy a parent can experience. From opening the first illegal birth control clinic in America in 1916 through the founding of Planned Parenthood to the arrival of the Pill in the 1960s, Margaret Sanger sacrificed two husbands, three children, and scores of lovers in her fight for sexual equality and freedom.\n\nThe organization Sanger founded \u2013 which now takes in more than $500 million in taxpayer funding annually \u2013 has grown to perform some 300,000 abortions per year in the United States.\n\nSanger was committed to ensuring every woman could control her own life. But like most visionaries, she was flawed: https://t.co/53HaXVZ3iS pic.twitter.com/7rYqHlcjvn\n\u2014 Planned Parenthood (@PPFA) October 14, 2016\n\n\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, 79 percent of Planned Parenthood's surgical abortion facilities are located within walking distance of black or Hispanic neighborhoods.\n\nSome 59 million abortions have been performed in the country since the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, nearly 18 million of them on black babies. As Breitbart News has reported, the Alan Guttmacher Institute also provided data showing that about 30 percent of all abortions in the U.S. are performed on black women, with another 25 percent performed on Hispanic women.\n\nPerhaps the most stirring statistic comes from New York City, where more black babies are aborted than are born.\n\nEugenicist Sanger, who began the Negro Project in 1939 and worked to bring birth control to blacks in an effort to reduce their population, joined with elite and well known African-Americans Mary McLeod Bethune, W.E.B. DuBois, and Rev. Adam Clayton Powell, Sr.\n\nThe Negro Project was sold as a solution to poverty and high birth rates among the black community. At the same time Sanger promoted her theory of \"eliminating the unfit,\" she also condemned charitable organizations that she believed were elevating the very population that needed to be weeded out.\n\nMore prominent members of the black community have recently come forward to speak out about the disproportionate number of black babies aborted in Planned Parenthood clinics.\n\nBaltimore Ravens tight end Ben Watson commented on Sanger's bigotry in August.\n\n\"I do know that blacks kind of represent a large portion of the abortions,\" Watson told TurningPointFriends.org, \"and I do know that honestly the whole idea with Planned Parenthood and [founder Margaret]\u00a0Sanger in the past was to exterminate blacks, and it's kind of ironic that it's working.\"\n\nRetired NFL Super Bowl champion Burgess Owens supported\u00a0Watson.\n\n\"Sanger looked at blacks as 'weeds,'\" he\u00a0told Breitbart News, adding:\n\nThe NAACP was not a black-run, black-originated organization. It was run by 21 white, socialist, atheist, Marxist Democrats. It was the antithesis of Rev. Martin Luther King Sr.'s community at that time, which was capitalist, Christian, very pro-life, and pro-America. So, these 21 white people began to put a message through to the black community that Democrats were good, liberalism was good, and they subscribed to the same philosophy that Margaret Sanger believed of blacks at that time.\n\n\"If you wonder why urban, young, black women are allowing themselves to be victimized by Planned Parenthood, look at BET [Black Entertainment Television], which is owned by very wealthy white Democrats,\" Owens urged. \"Look at the 15 years of messaging that has been gotten through to our urban black communities: anti-white, anti-police, anti-family, and pro-abortion.\"\n\n\"Forty percent of black babies have been given to the altar of abortion,\" he observed. \"In any other society, that would be considered genocide. Today, we put a nice name to it and, at the same time, have convinced our own mothers that their babies are no more than an inconvenience or a profit.\"\n\nDeadline, however, takes the leftwing view of Sanger as \"an icon and hero to progressives and feminists but a greatly reviled figure to the anti-abortion movement, which frequently has taken comments by Sanger about overpopulation out of context to imply racist intent.\"\n\nThe film's producers indicate they will be portraying Sanger as a bold hero to women and abortion as a \"basic human right.\"\n\n\"Margaret's story as an advocate who led the battle for birth control and eventually founding Planned Parenthood is so relevant given our recent election and today's climate as we are once again forced to deal with basic human rights,\" said Erika Olde of Black Bicycle. \"I share a mutual passion of the subject with Justine and look forward to bringing this topic and heroic individual to the forefront.\"\n\n\"The scope of Sanger's complexity, both as a revolutionary and human being, is extraordinary,\" said Ciarrocchi. \"I blew through Feldman's novel with such urgency, struck by the nuance, transparency and daring of her portrait. Her story explores the often brutal nature of activism and, most audaciously, the plight of the female soul.\"\n\nThe Deadline report continues that the novel is being brought to the big screen as \"abortion and birth control opponents look to make significant gains with the election of Donald Trump.\" Trump has vowed to eliminate Planned Parenthood's taxpayer funding if the organization continues to provide abortions, and to appoint pro-life Supreme Court justices.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee announced this week it will be referring Planned Parenthood to both the FBI and the Justice Department for investigation and possible prosecution.\n\nThat announcement comes following an investigation into allegations the abortion chain and its partners in biomedical procurement have been harvesting the body parts of aborted babies and selling them for a profit.\n\nSimilarly, two weeks ago, the House Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives referred Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast for criminal prosecution by the Texas Attorney General.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.58928561210632, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1008, "FairnessVirtue": 4, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.67526163083, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161216170000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.77777777777778, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/12/16/david-friedman-j-street-tries-raise-money/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [78, 1980, 2034, 3515]}}, "headline": "Radical J Street Tries to Raise Money off David Friedman Nomination", "wordcount_as_scraped": 564, "date": "20161217040000", "story_content": "The radical\u00a0group J Street is trying to raise money off President-elect Donald J. Trump's nomination of David Friedman to be the next U.S. Ambassador to Israel.\n\n\nAmong their complaints: Friedman once referred to J Street supporters as \"far worse than kapos \u2013 Jews who turned in their fellow Jews in the Nazi death camps.\" J Street is urgently soliciting donations \"to fight [Friedman's] nomination.\"\n\nFriedman's use of that term is objectionable \u2014 but J Street has done far worse.\n\nIn 2010, J Street was reportedly involved in efforts to promote Judge Richard Goldstone's \"war crimes\" report against Israel \u2014 which he later recanted. The group denied facilitating meetings for Goldstone on Capitol Hill, but did share contact information with George Soros's Open Society Institute, which arranged them.\n\n(J Street did not support the Goldstone Report, but it did not oppose the Goldstone Report, either. It applauded Goldstone when he retracted his claims \u2014 after the damage had already been done.)\n\nJ Street calls itself \"pro-Israel, pro-peace,\" but it has taken a number of anti-Israel policy positions since it started in 2008, including opposing Israel's wars of self-defense in Gaza, opposing Iran sanctions, and supporting the Iran deal.\n\nJ Street frequently attacks individuals it deems too pro-Israel, including Democrats, such as Alan Dershowitz. At the moment, it is attacking Israeli ambassador Ron Dermer for accepting an award from Frank Gaffney's Center for Security Policy. J Street is also urging the U.S. Treasury to investigate Jewish charities that help Israeli citizens who live in the West Bank.\n\nSo while Friedman's use of the word \"kapo\" was unfortunate, the fact is that J Street is actively \"turning in\" and attacking fellow Jews who do not share its radical agenda of Israeli surrender.\n\nLikewise, in the New York Times, former U.S. ambassador to Israel Daniel Kurtzer, who served under\u00a0George W. Bush, complains that Friedman believes that\u00a0 \"Israel has a right to build settlements and annex parts of the West Bank.\"\n\nAs Kurtzer ought to know, Friedman's position is close to past U.S. policy, as established by Bush (and, sadly, ignored by President Barack Obama.)\n\nAs former Bush administration official Elliott Abrams recalled in 2009, Bush recognized in a 2004 letter to then-Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon that some Israeli settlements would remain part of Israel in a future peace agreement, and that there would be growth within existing settlements in the West Bank, among other provisions.\n\nKurtzer goes on to complain that Friedman \"believes that the United States should recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\" That position has been a matter of federal law for the past two decades.\n\nStill, Kurtzer warns moving the embassy \"will inspire riots across the Islamic world.\" And what does not?\n\nHe also argues that supporting Israeli settlements will destroy the two-state solution. Actually, what is destroying the two-state solution is Palestinian terrorism.\n\nIronically, it is only when Israel has America's strong backing that it feels comfortable making concessions. The Friedman pick represents Trump's commitment to peace through strength \u2014 not through capitulation to terror and the far-left.\n\nJoel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Trump to choose\u00a0Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R.-S.C.), who worked closely with the speaker to expand immigration and guest worker programs, to lead Trump\u2019s Office of Management and Budget.\n\n\u201cMick Mulvaney is the absolute right choice,\u201d Ryan said.\n\n\u201cAt OMB, he will lead the work he has started to improve the way government does the people's business,\u201d the speaker said.\n\n\u201cMick is someone I have come to greatly respect and rely on, going back to our time serving together on the Budget Committee,\u201d he said. \u201cI look forward to working with Mick in his new role, and I commend President-elect Trump on this excellent selection.\u201d Ryan was the chairman of the House Budget Committee from 2011 to 2015, when federal spending increased from $3.52 trillion in fiscal year 2012 to $3.78 trillion in fiscal year 2014.\n\nMulvaney, a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus and early opponent of Speaker John Boehner (R.-Ohio), has found common cause with Ryan in the past, joining the Wisconsin congressman\u2019s months-on-end discussions with House Democrats regarding bringing more immigrants into the United States and providing illegal aliens legal status (amnesty).\n\nThe problem of Americans losing jobs to guest workers is the reality in Mulvaney\u2019s South Carolina, as revealed in a 2015 BuzzFeed expose: \u201cAll You Americans Are Fired.\u201d\n\nIt was the congressman himself, who best summarized how he and Ryan feel about immigration and guest workers when he said:\u00a0\"There are jobs that American citizens will not do. There are jobs that American citizens will not do. We can talk about why that is. We can talk about how our welfare state is broken, how we encourage people not to work, but that doesn't help the farmer pick his peaches this summer. We have businesses that rely on migrant \u2013 legal \u2013 migrant workers, and a lot of them are in this state.\u201d\n\nThe vigor of Mulvaney\u2019s support for amnesty puts his at odds with Sen. Jeff Session (R.-Ala.), who is\u00a0slated to lead Trump\u2019s Justice Department.\n\nWhen it comes to budget issues, Capitol Hill and other Washington conservatives support Mulvaney for OMB, an office that not only prepares the president\u2019s annual budget request and monitors budget trends for the president, but also has final approval-or-disapproval on all federal rules and regulations, including executive orders and so-called executive actions, as well as the coordination of presidential vetos.\n\nMulvaney will be at the nexus of Trump\u2019s decisions to uproot Obama\u2019s immigration and guest worker program, because so much of Obama\u2019s immigration policy was conducted as executive orders, which are formal directives from the president entered into the Federal Register and subject to judicial review, and executive actions, which are an Obama innovation that have the same force of an executive order\u00a0without the formalization. Often there is no written record of the action at all.\n\nFreedomWorks CEO Adam Brandon said: \u201cRepresentative Mulvaney\u2019s voting record reflects his commitment to limited government and economic freedom, a founder and member of the House Freedom Caucus, Representative Mulvaney became part of the conservative conscience of the lower chamber.\u201d FreedomWorks is a Washington-based policy and logistics hub for Tea Party and other conservative activists.\n\n\u201cThese convictions will undoubtedly show in the crafting of President-elect Trump's budget priorities,\u201d Brandon said. \u201cTrump has made yet another solid pick to serve in his administration. We wish Representative Mulvaney the best of luck and trust him to continue to exert his fiscally conservative principles at OMB.\" Mulvaney received a lifetime 95 percent rating on the FreedomWorks scorecard.\n\nTrump said Mulvaney\u2019s drive for results was a factor in his decision.\n\n\u201cRight now we are nearly $20 trillion in debt, but Mick is a very high-energy leader with deep convictions for how to responsibly manage our nation's finances and save our country from drowning in red ink,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWith Mick at the head of OMB, my administration is going to make smart choices about America's budget, bring new accountability to our federal government, and renew the American taxpayer's trust in how their money is spent.\"\n\nThe congressman said he was thrilled to be offered one of the most powerful positions in the the White House and the federal bureaucracy.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration will restore budgetary and fiscal sanity back in Washington after eight years of an out-of-control, tax and spend financial agenda, and will work with Congress to create policies that will be friendly to American workers and businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cEach day, families across our nation make disciplined choices about how to spend their hard earned money, and the federal government should exercise the same discretion that hardworking Americans do every day.\u201d\n\nThe President of the Club for Growth David McIntosh said Mulvaney is the man who can fix the broken federal budget process.\n\n\u201cThe days of the White House producing massive, ridiculous budgets that are dead on arrival on Capitol Hill are over,\" said the former Indiana congressman said.\n\n\u201cMulvaney is a leader among economic conservatives, and the Trump Administration's selection is a major victory for taxpayers and for all who want to see the downsizing of the federal government,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has walked the talk of economic conservatism and will bring that same steadfastness to the White House.\" Mulvaney has a lifetime rating of 93 percent with the Club for Gr0wth.\n\nJim DeMint, the president of the Heritage Foundation and a former South Carolina senator, said: \u201cI am delighted to see that my friend and former colleague Rep. Mick Mulvaney has been nominated to serve as director of OMB.\u201d\n\nMick will help end the \"business as usual\" approach to paying down our national debt\u2014and restore sanity to our nation's fiscal choices. https://t.co/gZjOMpr1ka\n\u2014 Jim DeMint (@JimDeMint) December 17, 2016\n\n\n\nSen. Tim Scott (R.-S.C.),\u00a0who replaced DeMint in the Senate, said his fellow Palmetto State legislator would go after the federal debt.\n\n\u201cWe entered Congress together in 2011, and I am certain he will tackle this new position with the same passion he has represented the 5th District with over the past six year,\u201d Scott said. \u201cFacing a $20 trillion debt, we need someone committed to restoring fiscal sanity in Washington, and I am confident Mick will work to do so.\u201d\n\nThe incoming chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, Rep.

The low-wage workers are not immigrants, but return to their homes after 10 months.\u00a0\n\n\"We're going to have to regroup,\" said Joe Bacigalupo, a government advocacy manager at the National Thoroughbred Racing Association, which favored the job outsourcing program. The new budget continues to late April, giving the various employer associations another chance to lobby for a revival of the Ryan expansion, he told Breitbart News.\n\nThe long-standing H-2B program allows companies to annually bring in 66,000 foreign workers instead of hiring Americans. The program provides the companies with cheap seasonal workers, minimizes the need for companies to recruit and train Americans, and it also cuts the salaries paid to full-time American workers, say advocates. \n\nRyan's December 2015 language expanded the visa program by saying that foreign H-2B workers would not count towards the annual 66,000 limit if they had worked for a H-2B employer during the prior three years. In effect, the \"returning worker exemption\" covertly quadrupled the size of the H-2B program from 66,000 visas per year up to 264,000 visas per year. That is an increase of up to 198,000 outsourcing visas each year.\n\nThe H-2B visa program is one of many guest-worker programs \u2014 including the white-collar H-1B, OPT and L-1 visa programs, the J-1 summer-worker programs and the H-2A agriculture program \u2013 that import at least 700,000 guest workers each year. The programs are so large that at least 1 million white-collar guest-workers live and work year-round in the United States.\n\nThe December 2015 expansion was buried in the budget bill for 2016. The overall bill was such a victory for Democrats that they gloated that Ryan \"gave away the store.\"\n\nBreitbart described the 198,0000 increase as Ryan's \u201cPink-Slip Plan,\" and as a quadrupling of the program.\n\nIn response to critical coverage of his outsourcing program, Ryan complained about the media coverage and defended the 198,000-job expansion.\u00a0\"There's one provision that I think has been so misconstrued\u2026 which is the H-2B visa program,\" he told radio-host Hugh Hewitt Dec. 21. \"This is a very small provision that was passed in the Homeland Security Appropriations bill last July,\" he told Hewitt.\n\n\"There has been so much hyperbole about this one provision pinging around the Internet, but that's the problem with omnibus appropriations,\" Ryan told radio host Bill Bennett Dec. 22. \"Big legislation leads to lots of confusion, lots of misinformation. It doesn't quadruple the [H-2B] program,\" he said.\n\n\"According to the Congressional Budget Office, it would result in less than 10,000 temporary workers coming to America next year,\" Ryan told Bennett.\n\nRyan was proved wrong.\n\nYear-end data from the Department of Labor showed that companies were able to import up to 119,232 H-2B workers, or roughly 50,000 extra workers, under Ryan's supposed 10,000-job expansion. \"Nationwide, thousands of employers won permission to hire more than 119,000 workers through the H-2B visa program for 2016-17,\" according to an analysis by the Palm Beach Post\u00a0of data at the Department of Labor.\n\nIf expansion had continued into 2017, that 50,000 increase likely would have jumped again in 2017, because few companies were ready to use the sudden 2015 expansion.\u00a0\n\nAfter approvals by the labor department, the Department of State provided H-2B visas to at least 84,626 foreign workers \u2014 plus at least 134,367 H -2A agriculture workers \u2014 during the 2016 fiscal year, the department told Breitbart. The Department of Homeland Security refused to tell Breitbart how many H-2B visa-holders it admitted into the country from October 2015 to the end of Sept. 2016.\u00a0\n\nRyan\u2019s office declined to comment for this article.\u00a0\n\nRyan is a pro-business libertarian, who has long supported job outsourcing programs that would allow companies to hire foreign workers when American employees demand higher wages. Ryan has even supported the large-scale use of immigrant labor at government-set wages so that companies don't have to invest in American-made robot technology, such as cow-milking machines, despite a massive level of hidden unemployment and a resulting drug epidemic.\n\nEven after Trump\u2019s victory, and many Democrats\u2019 public insistence that they gain from the nation\u2019s high-immigration/low-wage economy, Ryan has not changed his public support for a cheap-labor national economic strategy, which was used against him in his 2016 primary battle.\n\nSince 2009, Ryan's support for guest-workers has allowed President Barack Obama to gradually increase the inflow of white-collar and blue-collar guest-workers, from roughly 650,000 in 2009 to at least 750,000 in 2015. Obama has also awarded temporary work-permits to at least 1 million foreign migrants. \n\nMost of Ryan's extra 50,000 H-2B visas in 2016 were snapped up by the landscaping industry, but some were also grabbed by construction firms eager to outsource skilled union jobs to low-wage countries. \n\nThe H-2B system is a a first-come, first-served process, so industries that have difficulty hiring workers \u2014 such as the shrimp-fishing industry, which send boats and trained crews out for weeks at a time \u2014 can't get priority over the landscaping industry, which serves corporate customers in urban and suburban areas. \n\n\"It is not really any time to comment on that,\" Bacigalupo said.\n\nA horse-industry newspaper, the Thoroughbred Daily News, reported on executives\u2019 reaction to news that the program would be limited to 66,000 foreign workers in 2017.\u00a0\n\n\"They can continue to use the H-2B program,\u201d said\u00a0Alex Waldrop, president of the\u00a0Thoroughbred Racing Association. \u201cThey are just going to be using it subject to the 66,000 visa cap. They need to be proactive in putting in their applications for H-2B workers as soon as possible. They cannot delay, because there will be extraordinary competition [from other industries] for that limited number of H-2B workers.\"\n\nIf the program is limited to 66,000 foreign workers, horse trainers \u201care going to be forced into the very bad decision to either hire undocumented workers or not have the staff to handle the horses,\" Waldrop reportedly said.\u00a0\n\nExecutives could offer higher wages to attract American workers, another executive suggested. The loss of easy access to migrant workers \u201cmeans an increased overall payroll budget [and] a shortage of staff, which could then lead to a shortage of horses that could be in that stable,\" said Eric Hamelback, chief executive officer for the National Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association\n\nUnder Obama, the federal government annually imports at least one million legal immigrants, plus almost one million temporary\u00a0white-collar guest workers\u00a0and blue-collar guest workers for jobs sought by Americans. Those two million new foreign workers \u2014 plus the roughly eight million illegal immigrants in jobs \u2014 compete against the four million young Americans who begin looking for jobs each year. That wage-cutting competition shifts roughly $500 billion per year from wages and salaries into company profits, boosting investors and Wall Street, but reducing productivity growth and creating a huge population of government-dependent poor people in the United States.\n\nIn March 2016, Trump promised to protect Americans from the guest worker programs, such as the H-1B program, which outsources at least 650,000 white-collar jobs to foreign guest workers living in the United States: \u201cI will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program,\u201d he said \u201cNo exceptions.\"\n\nIn August 2016, Trump laid out his pro-American immigration policy in an Arizona speech:\n\n\nThe truth is, our immigration system is worse than anyone realizes. But the facts aren't known because the media won't report on them, the politicians won't talk about them, and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up.\nToday you will get the truth.\nThe fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful politicians. Let me tell you who it doesn't serve: it doesn't serve you, the American people.\nWhen politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following: amnesty, open borders, and lower wages.\nImmigration reform should mean something else entirely: it should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.\n\u2026\u00a0 most illegal immigrants are lower-skilled workers with less education who compete directly against vulnerable American workers, and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they will ever pay in\u2026\nWe will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet.\nWe will ensure that E-Verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law, and will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country.\nImmigration law doesn't exist just for the purpose of keeping out criminals. It exists to protect all aspects of American life \u2013 the worksite, the welfare office, the education system and much else. That is why immigration limits are established in the first place. If we only enforce the laws against crime, then we have an open border to the entire world.\n\u2026 The time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals \u2026 [including] to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first.\n\n\nRead the full text here.\u00a0\n\nFollow Neil Munro on Twitter @NeilMunroDC or email the author at NMunro@Breitbart.com.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 4, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1358, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 10, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 7.204222820419999, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 25, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 25, "mft_sum": 56, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161207220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.12371134020619, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 5.090909090909999}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/2nd-amendment/2017/01/22/ohio-college-presidents-demand-students-remain-defenseless-despite-campus-carry-law/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [683, 1052, 2143, 3405]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 561, "scraper_regex": 597}}, "headline": "Ohio Colleges Demand Students Remain Defenseless Despite Campus Carry Law", "wordcount_as_scraped": 597, "date": "20170123020000", "story_content": "A January 19 survey of Ohio colleges and universities found most boards and presidents determined to prohibit guns for self-defense despite a new law allowing concealed carry permit holders to be armed on campus.\n\nOhio\u2019s campus carry law was signed by Governor John Kasich (R) on December 19 after lawmakers passed the measure following the November 28 knife and car attack against unarmed Ohio State students. The law removes the state\u2019s ban on campus carry, allowing each college and university system to allow or prohibit campus carry as they see fit.\n\nThe law takes effect on March 19, 2017.\n\nCleveland.com\u00a0surveyed \u201cevery private and two-year college in Northeast Ohio and every public university statewide\u201d and found the \u201cgeneral consensus\u201d was that law-abiding students would continue to be disarmed on campus by college and university policies.\n\nFor example, Kent State University board of trustees chairman Lawrence Pollock said, \u201cThe university policy on deadly weapons\u00a0as approved in September represents the Board\u2019s position on this issue and we have no plans for further action.\u201d\n\nThe policy Pollock references bars law-abiding students from possessing a firearm for self-defense \u201cinside any university building, facility, or vehicle, that is owned, operated or leased by the university.\u201d It also bars them \u201cfrom possessing, storing, or using a deadly weapon while outside on university grounds, that is owned, operated or leased by the university.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the Kent State system will continue to maintain a gun-free campus like Virginia Tech University had in place on April 16, 2007, when 32 unarmed innocents were shot to death.\n\nCuyahoga Community College President Alex Johnson used an email to explain that his college system will retain its gun-free policy as well:\n\nI know this bill has been a topic of discussion across the College, and our faculty has brought various concerns to campus leadership and to me for clarification. I have been in close communication with Tri-C Board Chair Victor Ruiz and the other trustees about this matter.\u00a0Tri-C\u2019s Board of Trustees has no intention of taking action to permit concealed carry in Tri-C facilities.\n\nIn other words, Cuyahoga Community College will continue to maintain a gun-free campus like Umpqua Community College had in place on October 1, 2015, when nine unarmed innocents were shot to death.\n\nThe Ohio University faculty senate is urging the trustee executive committee to keep law-abiding students disarmed on their campuses too. The faculty senate submitted a resolution to the committee, saying:\n\nWhereas the full and free discussion of potentially controversial ideas and knowledge is essential to the academic mission of the University; and Whereas the possible presence of concealed weapons in instructional spaces and faculty offices will have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas; BE IT RESOLVED that the Faculty Senate urges the Ohio University Board of Trustees to take no action that would allow concealed carry on any of our campuses in order to reaffirm our commitment to a weapon free campus.\n\nIn other words, the Ohio University faculty senate wants to maintain the same kind of gun-free policies that were in place at Sandy Hook Elementary on December 14, 2012, when a gunman entered the school and had over nine minutes\u00a0without armed resistance to carry out his wickedness. He was able to kill 26 innocents during that time period.\n\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

The Daily Mail reports\u00a0that the CEO of Snopes, David Mikkelson, is currently embroiled in a vicious legal battle with his former wife and Snopes co-founder Barbara Mikkelson. The couple divorced sometime around 2014, but legal proceedings have continued between the couple.\n\nBarbara has claimed that her former husband embezzled money from the company. Court documents obtained by the Daily Mail state that Barbara accused David of \"raiding the corporate business Bardav bank account for his personal use and attorney fees.\" Barbara also claims that David embezzled $98,000 over four years, which \u201che expended upon himself and the prostitutes he hired.\" Barbara claims that David spent $10,000 from their business accounts between April and June of 2016 to fund an expensive 24-day holiday for him and his \u201cgirlfriend.\u201d\n\nIn a court filing from June, Barbara claims that David has \u201cbeen depleting the corporate account by spending monies from it on his personal expenses,\" and that David's access to account debit cards and cheque books must immediately be revoked \"right away before there are no funds left in the corporate account.\"\n\nAnother point of contention during proceedings was David's salary. David demanded that his salary be increased from $240,000 a year to $360,000, a sum that David agreed he would settle for, but believed was below \"industry standards.\" He argued that he should be making up to $720,000 a year. \"As I said, based on industry standards and our revenues, my salary should be about 2x to 3x what it is now,\" David wrote in an email to Barbara in April of 2016. \"I\u2019ll settle for $360K with the understanding that it's to be retroactive to the start of the year.\" Barbara disputed David's request, stating that it was \"not even in the galaxy of reasonable.\"\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, David has remarried since his divorce from Barbara in 2014. His current wife, Elyssa Young, works as an administrative worker at Snopes, but she previously had a lengthy career as an escort and adult film star working under\u00a0the name Erin O\u2019Bryn. Reviews for Young's \"services\" have been left on her personal escort website as recently as 2015. Young's websites and Twitter account describe her as \"a mature and experienced courtesan, idealist, activist & dreamer.\" Her website further states, \"Here\u2019s the donation I request for my time, companionship, and entertainment\" with \"non-negotiable\" rates of $1,200 for her minimum four hours and $5,000 for 24 hours.\n\nMikkelson has previously stated that Snopes does not take any political positions whatsoever. His current wife, however, has a history in politics. The Daily Mail reports that Young ran for the U.S. Congress in Hawaii on the Libertarian ticket\u00a0in 2004, during which time she distributed cards that\u00a0read \"Re-Defeat Bush\" and condoms with the words \"Don't Get Screwed Again\" printed on the wrapping. On her campaign website, Young outright stated, \"Let\u2019s face it, I am an unlikely candidate. I fully admit that I am a courtesan.\" Young's campaign however was unsuccessful, and she lost to Democratic incumbent Neil Abercrombie. \n\nSpeaking to the Daily Mail, David Mikkelson stated that Snopes did not have a \"standardized procedure\" for fact-checking \"since the nature of this material can vary widely.\" He also stated that the process \"involves multiple stages of editorial oversight, so no output is the result of a single person's discretion.\" When asked about the requirements for becoming an employee at Snopes, Mikkelson stated, \u201cAccordingly, our editorial staff is drawn from diverse backgrounds; some of them have degrees and/or professional experience in journalism, and some of them don\u2019t.\"\n\nAlso according to the Daily Mail, another one of Snopes\u2019 lead fact-checkers has a history of sex blogging. Writing under the pseudonym Vice Vixen, Snopes fact-checker Kim LaCapria regularly wrote about sex and fetish gear on her own blog, which was described as a lifestyle blog \u201cwith a specific focus on naughtiness, sin, carnal pursuits, and general hedonism and bonne vivante-ery.\u201d LaCapria\u2019s blog often featured reviews of sex toys.

It may not last long at all,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump also directly criticised Merkel for letting Germany admit undocumented migrants, insinuating that this posed a security risk following a wave of Islamic State jihadist attacks in Europe.\n\n\u201cI think she made one very catastrophic mistake and that was taking all of these illegals, you know taking all of the people from wherever they come from,\u201d Trump said, adding he had \u201cgreat respect\u201d for the chancellor.\n\nTrump went on to threaten punitive 35 percent tariffs on German carmakers like BMW if they build cars in Mexico and not the United States.\n\n\u2013 Brexit a \u2018great thing\u2019 \u2013\n\nIn other remarks, Trump said Brexit \u201cis going to end up as a great thing\u201d, and he backed a trade deal with post-EU Britain which would be \u201cgood for both sides\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna work very hard to get it done quickly and done properly,\u201d said Trump, confirming he will meet British Prime Minister Theresa May soon after his inauguration on Friday.\n\nThe British pound took a hit Monday after Britain said it might undercut the EU economically if it cannot obtain both single market access and immigration controls, with British media warning of a so-called \u201chard Brexit\u201d.\n\n\u201cOther countries will leave\u201d the EU in future, Trump predicted, largely due to the pressure the bloc was put under following a surge in arrivals of migrants and refugees fleeing war in Syria and elsewhere.\n\nMogherini however said it was \u201cabsolutely clear\u201d that Britain could not start any trade talks with the United States until it leaves the bloc.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.73300981521606, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 746, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 8, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.56163687338, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170116210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.3512064343163503, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/01/18/fake-news-cnn-legal-expert-schumers-attacks-trumps-pick-head-hhs-entirely-politics/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [164, 191, 385, 1103, 1340, 1975, 2331, 3590, 3829, 5295, 6150, 7335, 8513, 8524]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1248, "scraper_regex": 1353}}, "headline": "Fake News from CNN: Legal Expert Says Schumer\u2019s Attacks on Trump\u2019s Pick to Head HHS \u2018Are Entirely About Politics\u2019", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1353, "date": "20170118170000", "story_content": "The Presidential Transition Team called a CNN story\u00a0about Dr. Tom Price (R-GA)\u00a0\u201cjunk reporting\u201d and late Tuesday requested \u201cthat CNN retract this blatantly false story,\u201d noting that the network failed to accurately report all the facts.\n\nThough the term \u201cfake news,\u201d which\u00a0President-elect Trump used in a news conference last week to describe CNN\u2019s reporting, was not specifically used, it is clear the Presidential Transition Team considers this latest story from CNN yet another report from that network to which those words also apply.\n\nPrice, who will appear before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on Wednesday for his confirmation hearing to become the secretary of Health and Human Services, is one of eight Trump cabinet nominees Schumer has vowed to stop.\n\nA legal expert familiar with the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act of 2012 tells Breitbart News that allegations made by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on Tuesday and\u00a0first reported by CNN that \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s pick to quarterback the replacement of Obamacare, Tom Price, might have broken the law with a questionable stock purchase\u201d are baseless and \u201centirely about politics.\u201d\n\nLate Monday, CNN reported\u00a0that \u201cRep. Tom Price last year purchased shares in a medical device manufacturer days before introducing legislation that would have directly benefited the company, raising new ethics concerns for President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for Health and Human Services secretary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Office of Congressional Ethics needs to conduct an immediate and thorough investigation into these potential violations of the STOCK Act before Rep. Price\u2019s nomination moves forward,\u201d Sen. Schumer said in a statement first reported in the CNN story.\n\n\u201cThe transaction being harped about is so small it barely clears the law\u2019s reporting requirements,\u201d\u00a0Brady Toensing, former Senate legislative aide and current white collar criminal defense attorney, experienced in defending federal lawmakers and executive branch employees, tells Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, the stock purchase was done through a broker without the Congressman\u2019s knowledge, which is the end of the story for allegations like these.\u00a0 I suspect his accusers are well aware of this, which means these allegations are entirely about politics,\u201d Toensing adds.\n\n\u201cDr. Price's Morgan Stanley financial advisor designed his portfolio and directed all trades in the account. Pursuant to the arrangement with Morgan Stanley, the financial advisor, and not Dr. Price, has the discretion to decide which securities to buy and sell in his account,\u201d the Presidential Transition Team said in a statement.\n\nThe statement continues:\n\nDr. Price's financial advisor periodically rebalances his portfolio to ensure proper diversification. On March 17, 2016, Morgan Stanley undertook a comprehensive rebalancing of Dr. Price's portfolio. In the course of that rebalancing, the advisor purchased 26 shares of Zimmer Biomet, worth $2,697.74, on behalf of Dr. Price.\n\nThe STOCK Act of 2012 applied insider trading laws, which have governed the conduct of executives in publicly traded companies for decades, to members of Congress and employees of the executive branch of the federal government. Those laws require that prosecutors must establish that two elements must be proven to obtain a conviction for violation of insider trading rules:\n\n(1) The person who orders the trade in the stock has a fiduciary duty, \u00a0to shareholders in the case of the an executive in a publicly traded company, or to the United States and citizens of the United States in the case of a member of Congress or an employee of the executive branch of the federal government; \u00a0and\n(2) The person must make a trade in the stock on the basis of material, non-public information.\n\n\u201cIf Tom Price didn\u2019t direct or even know about the trades, how could he be trading on the basis of material non-public information?\u201d a second attorney, an expert in securities law, who is a partner in a major international law firm, tells Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cHe reported all these trades. None of them were hidden. His broker rebalanced his portfolio,\u201d the attorney notes.\n\nThe attorney says:\n\nSome of the stock purchases were in health care, some were energy, some were financial institutions. If you look at the disclosure there were 34 trades on March 17, and while they included some health care companies they also included: Bank of America, American Express, Lowes Corporation, United Technologies, Xerox Corp, Williams Co, Nike, and Ross Stores.\n\nRepublicans were quick to point out the highly political nature of Schumer\u2019s attack on Price, as well as CNN\u2019s role in spreading the narrative.\n\n\u201cI hate to interrupt *the narrative* but it seems awfully relevant that these trades were made w/o Price's knowledge,\u201d Brendan Buck, an aide to Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) tweeted on Tuesday.\n\nAt least one other media publication noted the partisan nature of the Democrats\u2019 attack on Price.\n\n\u201cNo lawmaker has faced insider trading charges since the law was approved, but it has given ammunition to Democrats eager to question Price's trading activity,\u201d the Hill reported\u00a0late Tuesday:\n\nDemocrats have gone so far as to call for Price's confirmation hearing to be delayed until ethics investigators have had a chance to review the activity.\nSens. Al Franken (D-Minn.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) said Tuesday that Price's confirmation should not go forward until an ethics probe has determined no wrongdoing was committed.\n\"Allowing Congressman Price\u2019s nomination to move to a hearing with questions about his ethical qualifications left unanswered would send an early, clear, and deeply troubling signal that the Senate\u2019s critical oversight functions will be given a back seat to the demands of the Trump Administration,\" the lawmakers wrote in a letter Wednesday to Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), who chairs the committee vetting Price.\n\nPresidential Transition Team spokesperson Phil Blando said\u00a0in a statement on Tuesday:\n\nAny effort to connect the introduction of bipartisan legislation by Dr. Price to any campaign contribution is demonstrably false. The only pattern we see emerging is that Senate Democrats and their liberal media allies cannot abide the notion that Dr. Tom Price is uniquely qualified to lead HHS and will stop at nothing to smear his reputation.\n\nBut late Tuesday, Schumer repeated and expanded upon his original allegation to CNN\u2019s Manu Raju.\n\n\u201cIf he knew about it, it could very well be a violation of the law,\u201d Schumer said.\n\n\u201cNow they say there\u2019s a broker, it\u2019s kind of strange that this broker would pick this stock totally independently of him introducing legislation that\u2019s so narrow and specific to this company,\u201d Schumer added.\n\nIn a highly unusual move, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest joined the partisan narrative about Trump\u2019s pick to run the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t seem like a complicated scheme; this seems like exactly the kind of financial entanglement that\u2019s left a lot of people feeling alienated from Washington, D.C.,\u201d Earnest said on Tuesday.\n\nThe Presidential Transition Team noted that \u201c[a]\u00a0key point is that if Price divested today, the total profit on this stock investment would be less than $300\u201d:\n\nDr. Price's financial advisor periodically rebalances his portfolio to ensure proper diversification. On March 17, 2016, Morgan Stanley undertook a comprehensive rebalancing of Dr. Price's portfolio. In the course of that rebalancing, the advisor purchased 26 shares of Zimmer Biomet, worth $2,697.74, on behalf of Dr. Price.\n26 shares divided by $2,697.74 is $103.76 per share.\nZBH stock closed at $115.20 on January 13, 2017. Dr. Price's 26 shares were worth $2,995.20 at the end of closing that day. Accordingly, his stock holdings in ZBH have risen a total of $297.46 since March 17, 2016.\n\n\u201cNo one has alleged he\u2019s traded based on insider information,\u201d the securities law expert who is the partner in a major international law firm tells Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is Dr. Price personally didn\u2019t direct these trades. The broker had the discretionary authority of the account to execute the trades,\u201d the legal expert adds.\n\nPrevious reporting by CNN\u2019s Raju was popular at the Democratic National Committee, where staffers mentioned earlier stories\u00a0Raju wrote\u00a0in several emails included in those that WikiLeaks released.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.95936143398285, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1248, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 16, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 12, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.629027483790001, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 48, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170118170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.84615384615385, "mft_mean": 4.36363636364}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2017/01/07/5885897/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [789, 1088, 1461, 1741, 1995, 2166, 3214, 4563]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 659, "scraper_regex": 703}}, "headline": "Donnelly: Dear Mr. President-Elect, Please \u2018Pick a Fight\u2019 with California on Behalf of the American People", "wordcount_as_scraped": 703, "date": "20170107160000", "story_content": "Even though most Americans view California as a lost cause\u2014the \"land of fruits and nuts\"\u2014and now, the epicenter of resistance to President-Elect Trump, it would be a mistake to ignore it.\n\nThe whiny, crybaby brigade of Democrats in leadership, who wield unchecked power over the most populous, and in many ways, the most significant state.\n\nCalifornia Democrats doubled down this week\u2014hiring former US Attorney General Eric Holder to go on offense against the policies of the incoming White House.\n\nPresident-Elect Trump should engage California's petulant leaders in much the same way\u2014\"pick a fight.\"\n\nIgnoring California in hopes that it will go away would be a disastrous mistake.\u00a0 California is far too important to the national security of the United States to simply ignore it.\n\nIn spite of the government-created water crisis that has devastated the world's \"food basket,\" (the San Joaquin Valley), California still supplies a majority of US agricultural products for export.\u00a0 Grapes, citrus, almonds\u2014yes, fruits and nuts\u2013(no surprise here)\u2014in addition to beef, poultry, dairy, tomatoes, all manner of vegetables, alfalfa, wine, cotton\u2026to name a few.\n\nWater wars between federal and state regulators, environmentalists, the Democrat governor, the Democrat-controlled state legislature, and farmers have gone on for decades with devastating results.\u00a0 Much of the world's most fertile farmland lies fallow, as groundwater, its lifeblood, is slowly siphoned off to keep farmers alive.\n\nPresident-Elect Trump has already wisely tapped a few leaders from the crucial Central Valley region, which is not only known for its agriculture\u00a0but is also home to vast quantities of domestic oil sitting atop the massive Monterey Shale.

As the NGO Human Rights Watch noted this week, on the occasion of his 1000th day in prison, the government has subjected L\u00f3pez to innumerable abuses, from throwing human excrement into his solitary confinement cell to throwing away his Bible. \u201cThey've censored poetry and history books, any material written in English, and publications ranging from The Economist to a magazine on surfing,\u201d the organization notes, and he has not been able to speak to his family for three weeks.\n\n\u201cIn a separate cell in his building, L\u00f3pez is allowed to watch TV for a few hours a day, on a set that offers only the overwhelmingly pro-government open-air channels or movies selected by guards,\u201d the group notes. The situation seems similar to the imprisonment of American citizen Kenneth Bae in North Korea, who wrote in his book\u00a0that he grew to hate television because of the hours of mandated Kim Il-sung propaganda in prison.\n\nHuman Rights Watch asserts that L\u00f3pez\u2019s 14-year sentence was the product of \u201cfabricated charges,\u201d confirmed by the prosecutor responsible for putting him behind bars.\u00a0\u201cLeopoldo L\u00f3pez is innocent,\u201d Franklin Nieves, the lead prosecutor in his case, told reporters after defecting to Miami in October 2015. Calling the charges \u201c100 percent false,\u201d Nieves argued that L\u00f3pez would remain imprisoned nonetheless because \u201cprosecutors and judges fear that if anyone dissents from carrying out an order, he will be detained, or a criminal case will be invented against him and he will be jailed.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.64006805419922, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 523, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.17010832258, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161116030000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.54493307839388, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/milo/2016/12/28/complaint-filed-against-prosecutor-who-refused-to-charge-michigan-state-milo-protesters/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [168, 683, 4386, 4390, 4425, 4436, 4450, 4453]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 628, "scraper_regex": 676}}, "headline": "Complaint Filed Against Prosecutor Who Refused to Charge Michigan State Milo Protesters", "wordcount_as_scraped": 676, "date": "20161228190000", "story_content": "Michigan businessman and civil rights advocate Kim Thompson has filed a complaint\u00a0with Michigan's Attorney Grievance Commission against Ingham County Interim Prosecuting Attorney Gretchen Whitmer in response to what he alleges to have been politically-motivated and biased action against Milo Yiannopoulos following his show in Michigan earlier this month.\n\n\u201cThe Complaint alleges that Whitmer steered prosecutorial and police action away from alleged lawbreakers whose politically motivated actions she supports, and against a visiting public speaker whose political views she disagrees with,\u201d a\u00a0press release emailed to Breitbart Tech stated. \u201cThe complaint alleges an apparent abuse of the office of the Ingham County Prosecutor to stifle free speech in Ingham County.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe complaint stems from press reports of Whitmer's handling of potential criminal charges stemming from unruly protests at a free speech event sponsored by a Michigan State University student group,\u201d it continued, referencing the left-wing extremist group BAMN which protested MILO\u2019s show.\n\n\u201cAfter some of the protestors refused to obey repeated police commands, several protestors were arrested by the MSU Police. Press reports indicate that the MSU police asked the prosecutor to file charges of obstruction and resisting arrest against two or more of the arrestees,\u201d the statement explained. \u201cAccording to a news reports, Whitmer refused the request, citing a lack of evidence. She then allegedly called on the MSU Police to instead investigate the invited speaker Milo Yiannopoulos, to determine if criminal charges could be brought against him instead of against the persons actually arrested.\u201d\n\nIndeed, on December 13 th , just a few days after the Yiannopoulos event, Ms. Whitmer stated:\n\"We may accept that Donald Trump will be sworn in as president, but we refuse to accept everything that could follow. We are going to stand up and fight every time he attacks a community of color or a religious community. We are going to fight every time he attacks public education, or women\u2019s health care, or worker\u2019s rights, among a litany of other things. This is just the beginning.\"\nAlmost a month earlier on November 10th, Gretchen Whitmer herself attended another anti- Trump rally on the MSU campus.

Her actions and failure to recuse herself create a public perception that governmental power may be directed against persons whose speech the prosecutor disagrees with.\"\n\n\"Whatever our personal political views, it is our duty as citizens to demand answers and to demand an open inquiry as to why the prosecutor would ask that police resources be used to investigate the speaker,\u201d concluded Thompson. \u201cNothing is more dangerous to our liberty and democracy than a prosecutor who may be willing to use police power to investigate and prosecute people with whom she politically or philosophically disagrees.\u201d\n\nFollowing the arrest of numerous protesters who refused to unblock doorways, MILO donated $17.76 to their bail fund.\n\nMILO and his tour crew had infiltrated the organized protest dressed in black masks and holding purposefully misspelled anti-MILO signs, before MILO unveiled himself to both the delight and horror of protesters.\n\nCharlie Nash is a reporter\u00a0for\u00a0Breitbart Tech.

(AP) \u2014 Less than a month from taking office, President-elect Donald Trump has yet to hold the traditional news conference that most incoming presidents have held within days of their victory.\n\nAs of Thursday, it had been 147 days since Trump held his last formal news conference as a candidate.\n\nTrump, whose refusal to do news conference has been criticized by journalism groups and media watchdogs, has instead tried to convey his message directly to the American public, bypassing the media with pronouncements at his boisterous rallies and, of course, distributing his thoughts 140 characters at a time on his famed Twitter account.\n\nHe was slated to hold a press conference on December 15 to discuss his plan to leave his sprawling business empire as he takes office but that event was postponed. Aides have said it will be rescheduled for January but no date has yet been set.\n\n\u201cAmerica has a tradition of an aggressive, free and independent press and a large part of that is that the press inquiries about the president and his stances on the issues,\u201d said Tobe Berkovitz, a communications professor at Boston University. \u201cThey probably can wave goodbye to that. It\u2019s quite obvious that Trump has no interest in following the traditions of the presidency and relationship with the press.\u201d\n\nBut while his lack of press interaction is a worry to some, many Trump supporters cheered the celebrity businessman\u2019s battles with what they felt were biased reporters. Trump made his antagonistic relationship with the media a centerpiece of his campaign, inciting his rally crowds to boo the press, singling out individual reporters with derogatory names like \u201csleazebag\u201d and using Twitter to attack coverage he didn\u2019t like.\n\nHis predecessors took a different approach.\n\nTwo days after the Supreme Court decision gave him the 2000 election, George W. Bush held a press conference where reporters asked him about his Cabinet picks and tax plans. He proceeded to field more questions each of the next two days. Barack Obama, also regularly held news conferences after winning, taking questions from the White House press corps 18 different times as president-elect. Bush, who had a shorter transition due to the extended Florida recount, did so 11 times.\n\nNo modern president-elect has waited as long as Trump to field questions. Since taking office, he has sat for a few television interviews and has taken a handful of shouted questions from the press pool \u2014 a small group of reporters who follow the president \u2014 a few times at Trump Tower in New York and on Thursday outside his coastal Florida estate.\n\nTrump\u2019s team has downplayed the need for news conferences. Kellyanne Conway, a newly appointed White House counselor, said Thursday that the press would have access to the president.\n\n\u201cThis will be a traditional White House in the sense that you will have a great deal of press availability on a daily basis and you\u2019ll have a president who continues to be engaged with the press,\u201d she said in an interview with ABC.\n\nTrump\u2019s last full-fledged news conference was July 27, which he held at his Miami-area golf course as counter-programming to the ongoing Democratic National Convention. It was there that Trump called upon Russia to hack his opponent Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails saying, \u201cI will tell you this, Russia: If you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.\u201d\n\nHis staff later insisted that Trump was joking.\n\nBefore that, Trump and his staff had mocked Clinton for not holding her own news conferences. In May, Trump tweeted: \u201cI am getting great credit for my press conference today. Crooked Hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days.\u201d\n\nClinton eventually had one after 276 days and then held several more before Election Day. Trump fielded a few questions from a handful of reporters in September on his plane and took a few more in a gaggle after the first presidential debate but did not hold another news conference.\n\nBut since the one he hosted in July, he has tweeted more than 1,000 times.\n\n___\n\nReach Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.5471167564392099, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 642, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.13588002263, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 14, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161223030000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.1806853582554497, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.2727272727299999}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/12/18/washington-post-virgin-mary-offends-rape-victims-by-her-purity/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3155]}}, "headline": "Washington Post: Virgin Mary Offends Rape Victims by Her Purity", "wordcount_as_scraped": 523, "date": "20161218170000", "story_content": "This year the Left's annual War on Christmas has taken a bizarre turn with a Washington Post op-ed claiming that the Virgin Mary's purity is offensive to victims of rape.\n\nIn an article titled, \"Our culture of purity celebrates the Virgin Mary. As a rape victim, that hurts me,\" Ruth Everhart explains that especially in the Advent lead-up to Christmas, Mary becomes a problem for many Christians because of her pristine purity.\n\nMary \"set an impossibly high bar,\" Everhart writes. \"Now the rest of us are stuck trying to be both a virgin and a mother at the same time.\"\n\nAs a rape victim, this has been especially difficult for the author, she says, which led to her becoming a pastor, in order \"to come to terms with Mary's story.\"\n\nEverhart writes that she doesn't blame her sense of ruin \"entirely\" on the Virgin Mary. In fact, it isn't really Mary's fault, she states; it's the Church's for manipulating Mary into a model of purity.\n\n\"Mary is not responsible for what we've done to her story,\" she writes. \"Church culture has overfocused on virginity and made it into an idol of sexual purity. When it comes to female experience, the church seems compelled to shrink and distort and manipulate.\"\n\nTo some people, \"vaginas are inherently dirty,\" she states. \"They can never be purified.\"\n\n\"And isn't that the definition of hopelessness? Does it bother you that half of the human population is condemned to hopelessness because their body parts can never be pure?\" she asks rhetorically.\n\nNever mind that you can attend a thousand Christian church services without ever hearing a sermon on purity. Never mind that virginity is rarely held up as a model in our sex-soaked western culture, even within our churches. Never mind that Christians have elaborated an entire \"Theology of the Body\" to help people appreciate the human body and sexuality as a beautiful gift of God.\n\nFor Everhart, it's the Christians' fault when people feel sexually dirty.\n\n\"Maybe the church could ask body-owners to weigh in about their experiences,\" she writes, as if most Christian preachers were incorporeal beings. \"Most people have thoughts and feelings about their sexual selves. Having a body is complicated. It involves trial and error,\" she adds, as if this were somehow news to Christians.\n\nYet, teaching young people the value of purity or to appreciate abstinence before marriage is no solution, Everhart contends. Purity is no model for today's generation.\n\n\"We want to pretend sexuality is something we can lock in a box and keep on a shelf. But a lockbox won't work. Neither will a chastity belt or a purity ring. Certainly not the abstinence pledges they make young folks sign,\" she writes.\n\nAnd turning to the Virgin Mary, Everhart asks: \"How do you feel about what the patriarchy has done with you?\"\n\nIt's a good thing Mary doesn't answer. She might be tempted to note that she fared considerably better at the hands of the \"patriarchy\" than she has from her feminist sisters who twist her story into something political, petty, and ultimately uninspiring.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

Stories that have been disputed may also appear lower in News Feed.\"\n\nIFCN is hosted by the Poynter Institute for Media Studies. A cursory search of the Poynter Institute website finds that Poynter's IFCN is openly funded by Soros' Open Society Foundations as well as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Google, and the National Endowment for Democracy.\n\nPoynter's IFCN is also funded by the Omidyar Network, which is the nonprofit for liberal billionaire eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. The Omidyar Network has partnered with the Open Society on numerous projects and it has given grants to third parties using the Soros-funded Tides Foundation. \u00a0Tides is one of the largest donors to left-wing causes in the U.S.\n\nAnother significant Poynter Institute donor is the Craig Newmark Foundation, the charitable organization established by Craigslist Founder Craig Newmark. On Monday, just days before the announcement of the Facebook partnership, Poynter issued a press release revealing that Newmark donated $1 million to the group to fund a faculty chair in journalism ethics.\n\nStates the press release:\n\nThe gift will support a five-year program at Poynter that focuses on verification, fact-checking and accountability in journalism. It\u2019s the largest donation Poynter\u2019s ever received from an individual foundation.\nThe Newmark Chair will expand on Poynter\u2019s teaching in journalism ethics and develop certification programs for journalists that commit to ethical decision-making practices. The faculty member will also organize an annual conference on ethics issues at Poynter and be a regular contributor to Poynter.org.\n\nNewmark funds scores of liberal groups also financed by Soros, including the Sierra Club, the New America Foundation, and the Sunlight Foundation.\n\nNewmark also finances the investigative journalism group called the Center for Public Integrity, where he serves on the board. \u00a0Soros' Open Society is another Public Integrity donor.\n\nSoros has earned his megafortune in part by short selling currencies and causing economic crises. He is credited with breaking the pound on September 16, 1992 in a day that became known in Britain as \"Black Wednesday.\" He reportedly made $1.2 billion from that crisis.\u00a0 In 2002, he was convicted for insider trading.\n\nPoynter, meanwhile, has hosted controversial journalism programs in the past, including one that was accused of downplaying the threat of global Islamic terrorism. FoxNews.com reported the course suggested reporters \"keep the death toll from Islamic terrorism in 'context' by comparing that toll to the number of people killed every year by malaria, HIV/AIDS and other factors.\"\n\nThe course taught reporters that the term \"jihad\" means internal struggle, and it discussed what it claimed was the issue of \u201cright-wing activists\u201d attempting to link American Muslims to terrorism.\n\nContinued FoxNews.com:\n\nThe section includes the good-journalism tip that reporters should check to see if experts they\u2019re interviewing \u201chave a bias or a stake in the story you are covering.\u201d But then it only cites examples of anti-Muslim groups.\n\nThe course in Islam, Fox News reported, was supported by a group calling itself the Social Science Research Council, which has received funding from Soros-financed groups.\n\nIn response to the report, the Poynter Institute explained that it created the course \u201cas a tool for journalists who want to be accurate in educating their audience about the religion and culture of Islam, Muslim communities in the U.S., and the distinctions between Islam as a political movement and the radical philosophies that inspire militant Islamists.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe there is a need to better understand the complexities of Muslim societies and the online course offered by Poynter and Washington State University is a vital resource toward that end,\u201d Poynter added.\n\n\u201cThe values underpinning the course are truth, accuracy, independence, fairness, minimizing harm and context \u2014 the core journalistic values on which we build all our teaching here at Poynter.\u201d\n\nPoynter's IFCN code of principles for news outlets, meanwhile, reads as follows:\n\n1. A COMMITMENT TO NONPARTISANSHIP AND FAIRNESS\nWe fact-check claims using the same standard for every fact check. We do not concentrate our fact-checking on any one side.

Jeff Sessions", "wordcount_as_scraped": 757, "date": "20161118230000", "story_content": "Sen. Jeff Sessions was selected by President-elect Donald Trump to serve as his Attorney General, putting him in line to become the top law and order position of the Trump administration.\n\nHere are six things you need to know about Jeff Sessions:\n\n1: The First U.S. Senator to Endorse Donald Trump for President\n\nSessions was already familiar with Trump when the developer came to Capitol Hill to testify about proposed renovations to the U.N. headquarters in 2005. Trump argued that the proposed $1.5 billion cost was outrageous estimating that the actual cost could be done with $700 million.\n\nSessions called Trump's testimony \"a breath of fresh air\" and thanked him for showing Congress how to save money.\n\n\n\nIn September 2015, Trump traveled to Washington D.C. to attend a rally against the Iran deal. He met with Sessions afterward, prompting speculation that the veteran senator was open to endorsing Trump.\n\nIn February 2016, Sessions appeared at a rally with Trump in Mobile, Alabama and endorsed him for president, a blow for his senate colleague Ted Cruz who was also running for president.\n\n\u201cI told Donald Trump this isn\u2019t a campaign, this is a movement,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cLook at what\u2019s happening. The American people are not happy with their government.\u201d\n\nIn August 2016, Sessions wore a 'Make Mexico Great Again Also' hat while Trump outlined his tough positions on illegal immigration.\n\nGreat again. pic.twitter.com/34TJbUAz96\n\u2014 Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) November 18, 2016\n\n\n\n2: Leading opponent of amnesty:\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions is undoubtedly the biggest opponent of amnesty for illegal immigrants.\n\nSessions repeatedly denounced establishment members of both parties who worked hand in hand with top members of the business community as \"Masters of the Universe\" who worked behind closed doors to plot the legalization for illegal immigrants in Congress.\n\nHe has a drawing of He-man and Battle Cat hanging in his office together with a transcript of remarks he made in 2007, after delivering a speech denouncing President George W. Bush's efforts for immigration reform.\n\n\n\nHe reused his \"Masters of the Universe\" talking points again in 2013, opposing the amnesty pursued by the Gang of Eight, an effort that was widely supported by Silicon Valley tech giants including Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg.\n\n3. Led populist revolt against\u00a0TPP\n\nSessions was adamantly against the Transpacific Partnership trade deal, a deal that most Republicans were happy to work with Obama to get passed.\n\n\"For too long the United States has entered in the trade deals, on the promise of economic bounty only to see workers impoverished, industries disappear, manufacturing jobs declined,\" Sessions said in a speech against a vote to give Obama authority to negotiate the trade deal.\n\nSessions was one of only five Republican senators who voted against giving Obama the authority to negotiate the deal.\n\n4. Leftist Attacks:\n\nWhen President Ronald Reagan nominated Sessions in 1985 to serve as a federal judge in Alabama, Democrats were ready. Sessions was accused of being racially insensitive, and unfit to serve, as former employees testified against him.\n\nSen. Ted Kennedy denounced Sessions as \"a throwback to a shameful era which I know both black and white Americans thought was in our past.\"\n\nModerate Republican senator Arlen Specter later admitted that his vote against Sessions was \"a mistake.\"\n\n\"I have since found that Sen. Sessions is egalitarian,\" he told reporters in 2009.\n\n5. Record of supporting civil rights\n\nThe Trump campaign reacted on Friday to accusations that Sessions was too controversial a nominee.\n\nThey pointed out that as attorney general in Alabama, Sessions filed desegregation lawsuits and supported the 30-year extension of the Civil Rights Act. The Trump team noted that Sessions voted to confirm Attorney General Eric Holder and proposed awarding the Congressional Medal of Honor to Rosa Parks.\n\n6. Criminal Justice reform and the Crack Cocaine thing:\n\nDuring confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice nominee Sonia Sotomayor, Sessions told one of the witnesses that he was supportive of lowering criminal penalties for users of crack cocaine.\n\n\"Sen. Leahy and I are talking, during these hearings, we're going to do that crack cocaine thing that you and I have talked about before,\" he said as the room erupted in laughter. After Sessions realized how funny his statement sounded, he grinned and corrected the record.\n\n\n\nIn 2010, the Washington Post endorsed a bill proposed by Sessions and Democratic Senator Dick Durbin to do exactly that.\n\n\"Assistant Senate Majority Leader Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) deserve credit for hammering out the compromise and shepherding the bill through the Senate,\" the editorial noted.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.39946737885475203, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 707, "FairnessVirtue": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.9625764975999997, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161118230000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.6775106082036797, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/01/23/obama-failed-free-five-gitmo-detainees-approved-transfer/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e1": [145, 538, 1120, 3191], "\u00a0": [1870, 2575, 3454]}}, "headline": "Gitmo Detainees Approved for Release in Obama Era Unlikely to Be Released", "wordcount_as_scraped": 628, "date": "20170124050000", "story_content": "Only 41 captives remain in the U.S. military detention facility in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, including five who have been deemed eligible for release by a multi-agency board established by the administration of former President Barack Obama who vowed to shut down the prison.\n\nThe Washington Post (WaPo) quotes Wells Dixon, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), as saying the Obama administration is to blame for the fact that the Guant\u00e1namo facility, commonly known as Gitmo, remains open.\n\nHe said the Obama administration's instinct to fight off legal challenges is responsible for the continued detention of some of the terrorists still held at Gitmo, including at least two of the five who have been approved for transfer \u2014 Sufyian Barhoum from Algeria and Abdul Latif Nasir from Morocco.\n\nThe Obama administration's \u201crejection of the legal petition to free the two prisoners, just days before [President Donald] Trump took office and shut down future transfer options, meant the men 'may remain stranded at Guant\u00e1namo forever,'\u201d declared Dixon.\n\nWaPo explains:\n\nAttorneys for the [two] men, who were not included in a final set of [law mandated] notifications officials submitted to Congress regarding upcoming transfers say their repatriation did not come together for reasons unrelated to their backgrounds or security profiles. The legal teams requested that judges waive steps required before transfers can take place, including a 30-day congressional notice period, to allow the men to be moved before Trump took office. Last week, judges denied those requests.\n\nThe five men who have been approved for transfer by Obama's parole-style Periodic Review Board (PRB) but still remain at Gitmo have been identified as: Barhoum from Algeria; Nasir from Morocco; \u00a0Rida bin Saleh al Yazidi from Tunisia; Tawfiq Nisar al-Bihani from Yemen; and Muieen al-Din Jamal al-Din al-Sattar of undetermined nationality.\n\nWaPo notes that like nearly all of the 41 detainees who remain at Gitmo, none of the men who have been approved for transfer have been convicted of a crime.\n\n\"Two of the men, an Algerian named Sufyian Barhoumi and Moroccan Abdul Latif Nasir, now face indefinite detention after the defeat of an 11th-hour court action aimed at securing their release,\" adds the Post.\n\nAmong the prisoners released under Obama\u2019s watch are some who had been designated as \"forever prisoners,\" or too dangerous to release. The too-dangerous-to-release designation did not prevent\u00a0President Obama from liberating or clearing detainees for transfer.\n\nOf the 41 prisoners still held at Gitmo, more than half have been deemed as \"forever prisoners,\u201d which means they are facing indefinite detention. As of late last year, at least six had been facing death penalty tribunals, according to the Miami Herald.\n\n\u201cThere is a group of very dangerous people that we have strong evidence of having been guilty of committing terrorist acts against the United States,\u201d conceded Obama, referring to Gitmo prisoners in November.\n\nPresident Trump has said no more prisoners should be transferred out of the Guant\u00e1namo facility, commonly known as Gitmo.\n\nIn his quest to shut down Gitmo, Obama met bipartisan opposition in Congress, particularly to a primary tenet of the Democratic president's proposal to close the military detention center \u2014 transferring captives onto U.S.\u00a0soil.\n\nThe president himself signed legislation into law that prohibits the United States government from transferring prisoners to the United States.\n\nNevertheless, he blamed \u201call these rules and norms and laws\u201d for his failure to shut down Gitmo.\n\nIn November, President Obama suggested that he considered executive options for circumventing Congress but noted that there would be legal challenges.\n\n\u201cObama failed to accomplish his primary goal of shuttering the facility, unable to overcome political opposition to congressionally sanctioned steps, and unwilling to resort to executive action to make such a controversial move,\u201d points out WaPo.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.77777767181396, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 621, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.3914448069, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170124050000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.7037037037037, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/01/06/brazil-prison-riot-fugitives-post-selfies-mocking-police-facebook/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [106, 115, 309, 432, 556, 810, 921, 1088, 1277, 2000, 2294, 2491, 2564]}}, "headline": "\u2018Single Ladies Watch Out\u2019: Brazil Prison Riot Fugitive Posts Selfies on Facebook", "wordcount_as_scraped": 588, "date": "20170107020000", "story_content": "Brayan Bremer, one of over\u00a0hundreds\u00a0of inmates who escaped from two prisons in western Brazil over New Year\u2019s Eve, is taunting police with selfies apparently taken from deep within the Amazon rainforest which surfaced on Facebook\u00a0throughout the week.\n\nA Facebook account carrying Bremer\u2019s name posted a photo of himself and another fugitive of Manaus\u2019s\u00a0Antonio Trindade prison (Ipat), where 72 prisoners escaped during a riot on Sunday morning (another 112 escaped from nearby\u00a0Anisio Jobim penitentiary). The caption for the photo reads, \u201cescaped from prison.\u201d\n\nBrazilian authorities have confirmed that the other man in the photo has been recaptured, along with another 40 escaped inmates, yet many remain free. The situation has\u00a0left many in Manaus terrified, now fearing that violent criminals are walking their streets with police having\u00a0been able to do little so far to restore order.\n\nPolice have dismissed most rumors, though this has done little to return the city back to normal. Brazilian newspaper\u00a0O Globo reports that rumors of mass robberies, inmates wearing counterfeit police uniforms, and new massacres abound in the inland regional capital. Manaus was already a crime capital, and\u00a0O Globo reports that at least eight homicides have occurred in the city between Wednesday and Friday alone.\n\nBremer appears to remain among those still on the loose. Other photos show him with a group in the Amazon rain forest eating fruit.\n\nThe BBC confirms that the account appears to be Bremer\u2019s, a fugitive who was serving a sentence for robbery before escaping on the morning of January 1. The outlet claims his Facebook account, which had remained active throughout his incarceration, has been deleted, though it appears the same account is still live and has posted more photos since the BBC story was published. The latest photo on the account is yet another rain forest selfie, this time captioned, \u201cSingle ladies\u00a0watch out!\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile multiple fan pages have surfaced for Bremer, the page posting these photos boast selfies of Bremer dating as far back as 2014, suggesting it is not a copycat account created after his story made headlines. One such selfie dating back to 2014 is captioned \u201cFamilia do Norte\u00a0\u2013 FDN,\u201d the name of one of Brazil\u2019s most notorious drug gangs.\n\nLocal authorities in Amazonas state have blamed the FDN for organizing the massacre at Anisio Jobim (Compaj) as well as another riot\u00a0in Ipat. The FDN is currently engaged in a drug trafficking war with the\u00a0Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC), Brazil\u2019s largest drug trafficking gang, which has reportedly attempted to usurp FDN territory on the other side of the country in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n56 were killed in the Compaj riot, many beheaded and burned. In video taken by FDN members from within the prison, those holding the camera identify the severed heads of the victims as PCC members.\n\nThe PCC appears to have taken revenge for the New Year\u2019s massacre with a mass murder of its own in a prison in Roraima state, north of Amazonas. 33 inmates, which local authorities believe to have ties to the FDN, were killed, most beheaded and some with their hearts ripped out of them, on Friday morning. Authorities now fear a new string of such incidents throughout the country, though federal Justice Minister Alexandre de Moraes has refused to confirm whether the killings are part of a gang war, instead accusing local authorities of having evidence suggesting inmates at Compaj were planning a prison break and failing to prevent it.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 4, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -8.42607307434082, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 584, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.18938083251, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 17, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170107020000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.9109589041095902, "mft_mean": 1.54545454545}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/news/pence-to-anti-abortion-march-life-is-winning-again-in-america/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 509, "scraper_regex": 539}}, "headline": "Pence to anti-abortion march: \u2018Life is winning again in America\u2019", "wordcount_as_scraped": 539, "date": "20170127190000", "story_content": "Jan. 27 (UPI) \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence told thousands of abortion opponents at the March for Life in Washington the results of November\u2019s election show \u201clife is winning in America again.\u201d\n\nThousands of demonstrators descended on Washington on Friday for the annual rally and were greeted by a capital friendlier to their views than it has been in a decade.\n\nWith Republicans controlling majorities in both houses of Congress and President Donald Trump, a reformed abortion opponent, occupying the White House, social conservatives who have called for strict rules on a woman\u2019s ability to terminate a pregnancy find themselves taking center stage.\n\nA sign of how much the anti-abortion movement has taken center stage: Trump dispatched two of the most powerful figures in his administration, Pence and special adviser Kellyanne Conway, to serve as prime speakers at Friday\u2019s march on the National Mall.\n\nTrump also tweeted out his support for the march.\n\nPence addressed the crowd, thanking them for their support and promising the Trump administration would remain faithful to its campaign promises to social conservatives.\n\n\u201cBecause of all of you and the many thousands who stand with us \u2026 life is winning again in America,\u201d Pence said. \u201cIt is no more evident in any way than the historic election of a president who stands for a stronger America, a more prosperous America and a president I proudly say stands for the right to life, President Donald Trump.\n\nHe thanked the crowd for \u201cyour stand for life and your compassion for the women and children of America.\u201d\n\nAt the top of the agenda for many abortion opponents in the new Congress are a nationwide ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and cutting off all federal funds for the group Planned Parenthood, a non-profit women\u2019s health organization that is also the nation\u2019s single largest abortion provider.\n\nActivists are also girding for a fight over the vacant Supreme Court seat, which Trump has pledged to fill with a justice personally opposed to abortion. Senate Democrats have promised to filibuster any nominee who threatens to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion under the 14th Amendment, setting up what could be the first major showdown of Trump\u2019s administration with Democrats.\n\nTrump\u2019s path to leader of the anti-abortion movement was a long and complicated one. He once proclaimed himself \u201cvery pro-choice\u201d but since changed that position. During the campaign he spoke about a friend who considered having an abortion, but decided to keep the child. Watching the child grow changed his position on the issue, Trump said. Many social conservatives were slow to warm to Trump, but he won over many with an impassioned speech calling for a ban on late-term abortions, where he spoke in graphic terms about the procedure, which he said \u201c[rips] the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth.\u201d\n\nThat speech, combined with his pledge to nominate an abortion critic to the Supreme Court, rallied many social conservatives to his side.\n\nThe March for Life has taken place each January in Washington since 1974, to mark the anniversary of the Supreme Court\u2019s Roe v.

Americans decisively voted against Obama\u2019s rule by pen and by phone, and against Obamacare. We voted for a strong America that does not get rolled by China or Russia. We voted for trade policies that prioritize the needs of American workers; for rolling back the crushing regulations faced by small businesses, and to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of Washington corruption and ossified Washington cronies. It is overwhelmingly clear where America stands.\n\nBrat explained that while Speaker Ryan may not have been paying attention to the working men and women of this country,\u00a0\"some of us were listening and many of us have run on these breakthrough issues for years.\" Brat wrote:\n\n\"Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) said Trump has turned politics on its head and that Trump 'heard a voice in this country that no one else heard.'\nNot quite.\nSome of us were listening to the voices of the forgotten and downtrodden American workers.

It was a referendum, a call to attention and action by those who for years have felt abandoned by the political insiders, party elites, and corporate media that control Washington, D.C.\nNot everyone missed what Trump heard. Some of us were listening and many of us have run on these breakthrough issues for years.\u201d\n\nBrat continued:\n\n\"This isn\u2019t about personalities; it\u2019s about policy. Given time, it\u2019s possible that leadership would put together a list that closely resembles what Americans want. But we aren\u2019t being given time. We\u2019re being asked to vote on the Speaker on our first full day back in D.C. And it is absurd to think that we have processed the full meaning and implications of this seismic election in less than a week.\"\nWhy the rush? Let\u2019s slow down, think and properly plan this so we get it right. Look at what happened in the last two years when we didn\u2019t make our agenda absolutely clear to the American people. If we rush this Speaker election, the American people will feel manipulated once again. This is no time to undermine morale and do an end-run around them.\n\nBrat concluded: \"From our leadership, I ask for clear, unambiguous answers on how they will pursue the agenda the American people voted for. I am happy to vote for anyone who does so. I will not vote for anyone who does not have this agenda on paper for the American people to see. That is what the people I represent demand and deserve.\"\n\nConservatives\u00a0have noted that Ryan\u2019s personal policy agenda\u00a0was \u201crejected\u201d on November 8th\u2013\u00a0particularly\u00a0his views\u00a0on\u00a0immigration, trade and crime. According to polling data,\u00a0Ryan\u2019s open borders vision on immigration and trade is opposed by roughly 9 in 10 GOP voters.\n\nIt is unclear whether members of the House Freedom Caucus and conservative lawmakers\u2014including Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows, Jeff Duncan, Jim Bridenstine, Brian Babin, Steve King, Matt Salmon, Alex Mooney, Gary Palmer, Barry Loudermilk, John Fleming and others\u2014who voted for Ryan last year, will vote to elect him again as House Speaker on Tuesday.\n\nDisclosure: Julia Hahn used to work as a press staffer in Rep.

So that causes the surges \u2026 We\"ll see what happens after the election to see if it slows down.\" \n\nCurrently officials in McAllen have seen a spike in the number of Central American families and underage immigrants who arrive seeking refugee status. As the U.S. presidential election draws closer, service providers in this border city have been seeing more than 400 immigrants per day who have been apprehended, processed and released. \n\n\"It definitely has to be addressed. Congress has to get involved in an immigration policy and foreign policy with Central America,\" Darling said referring to the difference between the asylum seekers arriving to his city to turn themselves in to authorities and traditional human smuggling where enforcement plays a role as border authorities try to stop individuals from sneaking in. \n\nWhen President Barack Obama visited Cuba earlier this year, Darling said, the city began to seen a spike in Cubans who had the belief that the improving relations between the U.S. and Cuba would end the Cuban Adjustment Act that allows refugees from that country to become legal residents. \n\nMost recently, Breitbart Texas reported that the National Border Patrol Council accused\u00a0 U.S. Customs and Border Protection of trying to cover up record setting figures ahead of the presidential election.\n\nBreitbart Texas broke the story on the spikes of illegal immigrants arriving to this border city since 2014, when a shift in human smuggling routes pushed massive groups of illegal immigrants through South Texas. The illegal immigrants continued to arrive under the belief that they would be granted amnesty or some measure of relief similar to the DREAM Act. That belief became ingrained after immigration officials began to release hundreds of illegal immigrants with a notice to appear in court at a later date for deportation hearing. That notice to appear became known as a \"Permiso\" or permit helping drug cartels push that marketing ploy. \n\n\"What they (DC politicians) say, what the news media depicts, affects us down here at the border directly,\" the mayor said. \n\nAs the more dehydrated and weary immigrants continued to be released by authorities into McAllen and made their way to the city's bus station, local charities and the city began to provide food, shower and rest facilities to the hundreds of Central American families passing through on a daily basis. By providing basic necessities as soon as they are released, McAllen is helping northern cities from having to deal with individuals arriving in worse physical condition. \n\n\"We have added another tent with more services, another shower facility and we stretched the hours at the bus station, we were able to get another bus to come down,\" Darling said. \"(The immigration spike) its stretching the respite center capacity, the bus station capacity, border patrol capacity, CBP (Customs and Border Protection) capacity.\" \n\nAccording to Darling, the expenses for the services provided by the City of McAllen and the local charities have been out of pocket expenses, but they have been keeping detailed records preparing for the federal government to refund the expenses in a way similar to how FEMA refunds municipalities after catastrophes.\n\nIldefonso Ortiz is an award winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

It is, however,\u00a0a direct reaction to the rise in Muslim-led extremism throughout much of the Western world.

On the campaign trail, Trump promised to pause the resettlement of refugees who come from Syria or other countries that have a history of hostility to the United States.\n\nDuring FY 2016, 85,000 refugees were resettled in the United States. The Obama administration has asked Congress for budget authority to resettle 110,000 refugees in the country during FY 2017. Congress, however, has not authorized that level of spending under the interim budget for FY 2017 that will continue into March 2017. Authorized spending simply continues at the 85,000 annualized refugee levels.\n\nIf the current level of refugee resettlement continues for the remaining nine months of FY 2017, more than 100,000 refugees will be resettled, even though how the resettlement agencies would fund the additional 15,000 refugees who are not in the interim budget remains unknown.\n\nIf Trump follows through on his campaign promise, however, the number of refugees resettled in FY 2016 is likely to fall below 85,000.\n\nThe Obama administration continues to accelerate the resettlement of refugees from countries that the new administration is likely to place on the \u201cpause\u201d list: Syria and Somalia.\n\nSince October 1, 3,542 refugees have been resettled in the United States from Syria, an annualized rate of more than 14,000, an increase from the 12,500 resettled in FY 2016.\n\nDuring that same time period, 3,474 refugees have been resettled from Somalia, an annualized rate of slightly less than 14,000, which is\u00a0a significant\u00a0increase from the 9,020 resettled in FY 2016.\n\nThe Obama administration has continued to place the greatest number of Syrian refugees in Michigan, a politically tone deaf act given the role opposition to refugee resettlement played in President-elect Trump\u2019s upset victory there in November.\n\nThree hundred and eighty-nine Syrian refugees have been resettled in Michigan since October 1, more than in any other state in the country.\n\nCalifornia hosts the second highest number of recent Syrian refugees during that period, with 372.\n\nRounding out the top five destination states for recent Syrian refugees are Pennsylvania (261), Texas (245), and Florida (202).\n\nBoth Pennsylvania and Florida were swing states that voted for Trump in November.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott recently wrote a letter to the Obama administration withdrawing the Lone Star State from the federal refugee resettlement program, potentially setting the stage for a Tenth Amendment lawsuit to end the program there, similar to the one Tennessee will soon file.\n\nDespite public concern over recent incidents of violence committed by Somali refugees (Dahir Adan\u2019s September attack on ten at a Minnesota mall and Abdul Razak Ali\u00a0Artan\u2019s November attack on eleven on the campus of Ohio State), the Obama administration has accelerated the settlement of Somali refugees in the country since October 1.\n\nOf the 3,474 Somali refugees resettled in the country since October 1, 433 were resettled in Minnesota, the state where Dahir Adan resided, which is already home to the largest Somali community in the United States, which is estimated to total 70,000.\n\nRounding out the top five states to receive Somali refugees since October 1 are New York (343), Ohio (248), Kentucky (239), and Arizona (225).", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.79562044143677, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 584, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.83176742542, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 10, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161226180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.71232876712329, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.909090909091}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2016/12/20/texas-schools-rebuff-f-ratings/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [226, 310, 319, 405, 452, 517, 823, 884, 925, 1139, 1349, 1498, 1565, 1669, 1978, 1994, 2004, 2083, 2091, 2118, 2195, 2325, 2333, 2335, 2443, 2567, 2646, 2839, 3021, 3322, 3352, 3471, 3845, 3876, 3971, 4364, 4544, 4551, 4557, 4668, 4693, 4711, 4864]}}, "headline": "Texas Schools Rebuff \u2018A-F\u2019 Ratings", "wordcount_as_scraped": 732, "date": "20161220200000", "story_content": "An increasing number of Texas school boards are pushing back against the State\u2019s revamped public school accountability system by passing resolutions that call for lawmakers to repeal a new A-F\u00a0ratings scale.\n\nMonday evening, the Austin Independent School District school board\u00a0approved\u00a0such a resolution.

TASA asserts A-F grading\u00a0\u201ccreates a false impression about an entire neighborhood of children and shames students,\u201d adding the \u201creduction of a school to a single grade whitewashes the variance in a school, unfairly reducing every student to the school's assigned grade.\u201d\n\nOnline, TASA houses an arsenal of materials including\u00a0A-F talking points, a list of\u00a0school districts around the state that support the resolution, and a press release for school boards to send \u201cto local\u00a0media to alert them of the board\u2019s action, explain the concerns with Texas' A-F system, and let the public know there is a better alternative,\u201d which TASA believes is their \u201cvision.\u201d\n\nWhile most parents and teachers agree that standardized testing overshadows public education, the question is which version of accountability best serves students.\n\nSchool board members are\u00a0publicly elected officials who\u00a0join the Texas Association of School Boards (TASB), a lobbyist organization harshly criticized\u00a0by state Senator Lois Kolkhorst (R-Brenham) for their \u201cadults-first, children-second mindset,\u201d indoctrination, and groupthink culture in a Dallas Morning News report. A retired FBI agent turned Texas public school forensic accounting investigator shared similar sentiments about TASB with the Dallas newspaper.\n\nTASB represents the largest group of publicly-elected officials in the state and\u00a0includes all 1,030 Texas school districts, 20 regional education service centers, 50 community colleges, 16 tax appraisal districts, and 137 shared service arrangements. They note\u00a0one of\u00a0their\u00a0primary purposes is to represent school boards when lawmakers make decisions affecting Texas school districts.\u00a0Breitbart Texas reported\u00a0state legislators\u00a0proposed a bill to boot a slew of education lobbyists out of classrooms in 2015.\n\nFollow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on\u00a0Twitter.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.596658706665039, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 716, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.28903242037, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 9, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161220200000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 1.25698324022346, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.8181818181820001}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/12/09/democratic-senators-stall-cr-force-federal-government-weekend-shutdown/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [258, 766, 791, 882, 1115, 1656, 2696]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 523, "scraper_regex": 603}}, "headline": "Democratic Senators Stall CR, Force Federal Government into Weekend Shutdown", "wordcount_as_scraped": 603, "date": "20161209160000", "story_content": "Senate Democrats from coal mining states shamed their Democratic colleagues in joining them in a procedural vote Thursday that would have ended debate on the continuing resolution to\u00a0extend federal government funding through April over an extension of benefits for out-of-work coal workers.\n\nIn the Senate, there are two votes. The first vote ends debate, and that must pass with 60 votes. The effort to extend debate is called the filibuster, which is what Senate Democrats, led by Ohio\u2019s Sherrod Brown, did when they kept the Republicans from getting the 60 votes to end debate. The second vote on a bill merely requires a simple majority.\n\nAt the heart of the issue are pensions, such as\u00a0the ones administered by\u00a0Central States Pension Fund, which took over for failed coal mining companies that did not\u00a0secure the solvency of the pensions. The federal government had met the shortfall in the pensions in the last continuing resolution, but that funding expires with the CR Friday.\n\nThe federal agency that meets pension shortfalls, the\u00a0Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, is unable to continue to meet the gap in the coal pension obligations. The problem goes back even further to legislation signed by President Harry S. Truman that created a federal obligation to guarantee health and pension benefits of coal miners.\n\nIn a letter to colleagues in May, Brown wrote:\n\nWe understand that there are no easy answers, but we owe it to the hardworking Americans, who played by the rules and worked a lifetime for a secure pension, to do our best and not to wait for another day.\u00a0We already have a bipartisan solution to help the coal miners who sacrificed so much to keep the country's lights on.

Security Council\u2019s adoption of a resolution opposing Jewish settlements in occupied territory underscores its fundamental and bitter dispute with the international community about the future of the West Bank and east Jerusalem.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insists that there is nothing wrong with his controversial policy of building Jewish towns in occupied areas that the Palestinians, with overwhelming world support, claim for their state. But Friday\u2019s U.N. rebuke was a stark reminder that the rest of the world considers it a crime. The embattled leader is now placing his hopes in the incoming administration of Donald Trump, which is shaping up as the first major player to embrace Israel\u2019s nationalist right and its West Bank settlements.\n\nIn a series of statements, Netanyahu has criticized the Obama Administration for letting Resolution 2334 pass Friday by abstaining, using unprecedented language that has turned a policy disagreement into a personal vendetta.\n\n\u201cFrom the information that we have, we have no doubt that the Obama Administration initiated it, stood behind it, coordinated on the wording and demanded that it be passed,\u201d Netanyahu told his Cabinet on Sunday.\n\nIn turning his anger toward Israel\u2019s closest and most important ally, Netanyahu has underplayed the embarrassment that all 14 other nations on the Security Council voted in favor of the measure. Those votes came from countries that Netanyahu loves to boast of cultivating relations with, including Russia and China and nations across the developing world.\n\n\u201cThis is the same prime minister who told us dozens of states are on board with us,\u201d former Prime Minister Ehud Barak told Channel 2 TV on Saturday. \u201cI looked for Russia, China, England, France. Where are all the friends that were meant to stand with us?\u201d\n\nThe resolution marked a sharp international rebuke of Israeli settlement policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem \u2014 territories captured in the 1967 Mideast war and claimed by the Palestinians as parts of a future independent state. Some 600,000 Israelis now live in the two areas, complicating any partition of the land between Israel and a future Palestine.\n\nNetanyahu routinely dismisses international criticism of the settlements, saying that the dispute with the Palestinians goes back to long before the 1967 war.\n\nHe also notes that when Israel dismantled its Gaza settlements in 2005, Hamas militants responded by firing rockets and subsequently seizing control of the territory from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nWith Friday\u2019s resolution, however, the world sent a strong message that it rejects these arguments. The resolution said the settlements have \u201cno legal validity\u201d and constitute a \u201cflagrant violation\u201d of international law. It also urged all states to distinguish between Israel and \u201cthe territories occupied since 1967.\u201d\n\nIn the short term, the resolution is largely symbolic. It did not include talk of sanctions or any other punitive measures against Israel.\n\n\u201cThe importance of the resolution is to remind Israel, at least at the rhetorical level, that the international community is not completely happy, to say the least, with the ongoing status quo,\u201d said Arie Kacowicz, a professor of international relations at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.\n\nRiad Malki, the Palestinian foreign minister, said Netanyahu was being disingenuous by calling the resolution anti-Israel.\n\n\u201cThis resolution is about settlement activities, the two-state solution and ending the occupation,\u201d he said. \u201cNetanyahu, by his statements and his actions, is isolating Israel for the sake of settlements.\u201d\n\nMalki said the Palestinians hoped the resolution would bolster their case at the International Criminal Court, which has launched a preliminary investigation into the settlements. He also said he hoped it would encourage European countries to follow up on an EU recommendation to clearly label products manufactured in settlements, and encourage other countries to do the same.\n\nOn Jan. 15, days before Obama leaves office, France is expected to host a Mideast conference where dozens of countries may endorse an international framework for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Netanyahu vehemently opposes such activity, saying it undermines the negotiating process.\n\nThe recent diplomatic defeat would be much more damaging if not for a potential remaining and rather major ace in Netanyahu\u2019s hand: the incoming Trump Administration.\n\nIn a striking departure from past policy of incumbent presidents waiting on the sidelines, Trump tried to scuttle the resolution and called for a U.S. veto. After the vote, Trump vowed that \u201cthings will be different after Jan. 20th.\u201d\n\nCritically, he has appointed an outspoken supporter and donor to the settlements, his longtime attorney David Friedman, as ambassador to Israel. And aides say Trump is serious about a promise to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which even many Israelis fear could spark violence. The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, home to sensitive religious sites, as the capital of the future state to which they aspire.\n\nAfter Friday\u2019s vote, Netanyahu\u2019s office said he looked forward to working with Trump \u201cto negate the harmful effects of this absurd resolution.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu has since gone on a campaign to punish the countries that took part in the resolution. He has canceled a slew of diplomatic visits and summoned ambassadors from Security Council countries, including the U.S., on Sunday, Christmas Day, in protest. According to an Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter, Netanyahu also canceled an upcoming meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May.\n\nIt remains unclear what Trump might be able to do. While he will be able to wield the U.S. veto to prevent further action against Israel in the council, mustering enough votes to overturn Friday\u2019s decision appears to be impossible.\n\nThe basis for the resolution is found in the Geneva conventions, which forbid the settling of areas captured in war from another country. Israel has said the law doesn\u2019t apply because the territory was captured from Jordan, which has renounced all claims to the land. Israel has also defended the occupation on religious and security grounds.\n\nWhen Netanyahu\u2019s rivals in Israel oppose the settlements, it is not necessarily due to a conviction that could be peace could be at hand, but rather for concern for Israel\u2019s democracy. If Israel becomes inseparable from the West Bank, it will have to grant its 2.5 million Palestinians voting rights, or increasingly be unable to call itself a democracy.\n\nThe country is toxically divided on the issue, and key sectors of society, including intellectual elites and much of its security establishment, want to see settlements end. Many of them welcome \u2014 some openly, and many more quietly \u2014 any world pressure to bring that about.\n\nDan Miodownik, a professor of political science and international relations at Hebrew University, said there were actually some positive elements for Israel in the resolution.\n\nHe said it endorsed the idea of territorial swaps, meaning that Israel could keep some settlements as part of a negotiated peace deal. And the differentiation between Israel proper and the settlements signaled that unlike in the past, Israel was no longer being forced to defend its right to exist.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.64344930648804, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1133, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.1857119032599996, "HarmVirtue": 10, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 35, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161226040000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.0891438658428996, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.1818181818199998}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/01/03/christopher-essex-milo-delingpole-gallant-scientists-remembered-and-climate-politics-in-2016/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1528, 1824, 2330, 2482, 3511, 3657, 4292, 5458, 5537, 5993, 6208, 7050, 7121, 8898, 8906], "\u00e4": [6887]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1521, "scraper_regex": 1612}}, "headline": "Christopher Essex: Milo, Delingpole, Gallant Scientists Remembered, and Climate Politics in 2016", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1612, "date": "20170103220000", "story_content": "Fake news!? Fake news!? I'll tell you about fake news! For decades, scientists like me have been drowning in it. \n\nAt first, it was funny to read about how kittens, redheads and the Loch Ness monster were allegedly affected by climate transmogrification (CT). (The term \"climate change\" really doesn't cut it for true activists, does it?) Eventually even the people at Number Watch stopped keeping track of the more than 800 items on their list of things allegedly caused by CT because they were blown over by the scale of the journalistic baloney storm (BS) that fills human news bandwidth on climate. \n\nInitially, rationally minded people could chalk it up to human confusion and misinformation. But after the recent fake news follies of 2016, weighed against the sheer scale of the past absurdities, only the most earnest boy scouts would not see much of it as pure disinformation instead. \n\nPostmodern journalism maintains that the science of climate is like a toothpaste commercial where a consensus of dentists determines what toothpaste you should use. If you support their commercial's thesis, you are scientific; if you don't, then you are an enemy of the state, a Republican, or even a Trump supporter. That's the climate science of postmodern journalism: 100% pure fake news, top to bottom. \n\nOne of the greatest achievements of the postmodern mind is the theory that one can control the weather with taxes. Yes, I know! \u00a0It sounds so crazy that you just want it to work. I recall weather control schemes like cloud seeding, and of course there are more elaborate ideas in Star Trek, but controlling weather with public policy and virtue\u2014there are no words. Imagine the cure for cancer being increased library fines! \u00a0The true accomplishment was not their baloney storm (BS), but the level of cultural fervor that has been aroused through it, leading to titanic global power plays that have kept this zombie theory animated for a decade or two after it should have collapsed under its own weight. \n\nEven though it is stylish to excoriate conservatives with toothpaste-commercial moralizing about science, there is no science in the toothpaste-commercial science consensus picture. There is only politics, money, and power. \u00a0The political events of 2016 make plain that the climate arena is a side show in a much larger political struggle that has nothing to do with science. \u00a0Some sort of link between climate and power may have been inevitable because death, taxes and weather are all inevitable. Its such a glorious convergence of inevitabilities that rich and powerful increased-government enthusiasts could not pass it up. \n\nAnd so they didn't, making CT the mother of all baloney storms (CTBS) extending back decades before 2016. But the shenanigans of 2016 has made clear that something ugly has been done to us in science by people trapped in a political plane, incapable of comprehending that science is orthogonal to it. \n\nIs it Over Yet?\n\nMeanwhile, gallant scientists have passed away in 2016. \n\nIn January, my friend, Robert Carter, an Australian scientist born in New Zealand, died suddenly. Bob was a former university department head and a geologist, known internationally for his work in paleoclimatology. He fought against the social irrationalism of CTBS for years. After he publicly questioned it, he lost his status as an internationally known expert nearly overnight, and was tossed \u00a0into a nether world where he would be regarded as an unqualified climate denier, even being stripped of library privileges\u2014every petty indignity \u00a0a blow for virtue in the eyes of arrogant narcissistic fools, blind to the distinction between political and scientific thinking. \n\nBob and I corresponded frequently. We even had a long Skype conversation the weekend before he died. We were discussing a project to get people to actually see with their own eyes the Trubi Marls successions at Capo Rosello on the south coast of Sicily, where one sees ancient climate change clearly in the rocks. Well, that plan won't happen now, but perhaps one day I will make my way there in Bob's memory. \n\nHe described CTBS as \"surreal\" and saw it as a postmodern rejection of the enlightenment. \u00a0It was from him that I first heard the term \"climate realist\" to describe the few scientists and educated laymen who publicly stood against CTBS. He also first brought up the notion of \"noble cause corruption\" to help explain it. After the battles over the infamous \"hockey stick,\" he once exclaimed, \"Thank God for the Royal Canadian Mounted Sceptics!\" (He wouldn't have spelled skeptics with a \"k\".)\n\nHe had a deep calming voice that always carried a stabilizing message of rationality and realism. I'll miss that. We both wondered in our many email dialogues about the strange phenomenon where CTBS induces anti-science authoritarian bullies to pretend to represent science. He never complained about his lot in this, always keeping his courage, but he did wonder, like me, when the madness would end. \n\nNo, the icecaps are not going away; no, the polar bears are fine; no, winter will be with us always; no, the sea will not grow to cover the planet; no, carbon dioxide is not a dangerous gas; no, the alkaline oceans are not becoming acidic. No matter what factual blows it received the baloney storm would not end. We sometimes wondered whether we would live \u00a0to see the end of it. Some questions have simple answers: No, you didn't, Bob.\u00a0\n\nBill Gray was also a famous climate realist who passed away in April. He was a professor at Colorado State University who was a world renowned expert in hurricanes. Of course it was not possible to dwell on the physics of hurricanes if it got in the way of CTBS. Naturally the baloney storm called for more destructive and frequent hurricanes caused by CT. Bill would have none of that, which put him on the wrong side of the fashion that CTBS induced. \u00a0\n\nIt is the job of research scientists, like Bill, to challenge the fashion\u2014no point to the job otherwise, is there. If the fashion has the answers, then there is no reason to find new things out through research. \u00a0Thus Bill, in the best scientific tradition, naturally found himself outside of fashion and the kind treatment afforded by it, including any potential largesse of government research funding. It has always been this way. It is human nature. But with CTBS such prejudicial attitudes, normal to science fashion have been enormously heightened. \n\nA careful scientist keeps his head down. But Bill was completely fearless nonetheless. I never saw the like of it. That said, he was a kind and generous man, whom I learned much from. He too did not live to see the public vindication he deserved. When was the last monster hurricane that made landfall on the continental US? \n\nOlavi K\u00e4rner also passed in March. He was a patient soft-spoken even-tempered scientist from the Estonian Astrophysical Observatory near Tartu, whom I greatly respected. \u00a0\n\nHis circumstances were quite different than the others I mentioned. \u00a0He came out of the authoritarian environment of Soviet times, only to find it showing up all over again, intruding into his work on climate. Of course he knew exactly what he was dealing with. He once told me that freedom made him realize that his previous life \"was like living upside down.\" \n\nSadly, his book on climate data, Towards a New Climate Description: Analysis of Forcing and Response Time Series from Tartu University Press, finally came out just before he passed. \n\nThese people were all wonderful human beings, whom I shall never forget. They were much more than names unwillingly embroiled in a global political power struggle. They were all steady, brave souls, and we are all diminished by their loss. They are not better known simply because there is an awful lot of willful not-listening going on out there because of the postmodern mind.\n\nI dearly hope that we have finally reached the beginning of the end for CTBS and that I will live to see it become history, unlike some of my friends in 2016. But one never knows.\n\nTen Righteous Journalists Could Be Found in 2016\n\nBreitbart took a lot of unwarranted fake-news criticism toward the end of 2016. Contrary to that criticism, Breitbart supplies the biblical minimum ten righteous journalists so that Journalism could be spared divine destruction. For them, helmets were not just a fashion statement in 2016. Thank you for your brave efforts, which have my admiration. \n\nI would like to single out two Breitbart luminaries for special kudos. First, I mention Milo Yiannopoulous particularly because he has boldly stood up to the most sophomoric outbursts in public forums this year. Having endured such things personally (to a lesser extent), entertaining as they are, I know it takes considerable nerve: \u00a0kudos! \u00a0And, Milo, if you are interested in the vulgar details of feminist fluid mechanics, give me a call. \n\nI finish with a 2016 hat tip to James Delingpole for a very important reason other than his steadfast resistance against climate alarmism. He has shown consistently that he is more interested in facts than authoritarian pronouncements allegedly made by experts. \n\nToo many are intimidated by the CTBS cult of expertise.

He said: \"I don't think cultural niceties or political correctness were a barrier here, in this particular case.\n\n\"I think we missed opportunities because of our failings as an organisation to understand the problem but I do think in the future we need to watch very carefully that fear of offending, fear of causing offence, or upsetting minority ethnic groups does not stand in the way of robust policing.\"\n\nDet. Supt. Wallen added: \"It's very clear that West Yorkshire Police failed this girl on a number of levels. It's certainly clear there were opportunities to safeguard her that were missed.\n\n\"There were investigative opportunities to get to grips fairly quickly with the individuals that were perpetrating this sexual abuse upon her that were missed and there were opportunities particularly when she went missing to have made the connection between her going missing and the exploitation she was clearly suffering at that time.\n\n\"Knowing that, the most important thing for West Yorkshire Police to do is to acknowledge that and apologise to Autumn, which West Yorkshire Police clearly do.

After previously targeting gay pro-free speech Cal Poly academics,\u00a0they have now trained their sights on college President Jeffrey Armstrong.\n\nOn Monday, the Cal Poly Queer Student Union, a school-sponsored club that supposedly seeks to actively improve \"Cal Poly\u2019s campus climate for queer identified students,\" posted a photo on Facebook comparing President Armstrong's comments about the MILO event to those of Texas A&M President Michael Young, with this message:\n\n\u201cPresident Armstrong, do you really think the blending of white nationalism and lousy intellectualism should be apart [sic] of the \"global marketplace\"? We think not.\u201d\n\nThe post first quotes President Armstrong's response to calls for the cancellation of the MILO event:\n\n\nCal Poly's campus is an open environment where opinions, ideas and thoughts are freely shared\u2014even those that some may find distasteful and offensive. Censoring viewpoints that we don't agree with violates free speech and does not represent what we stand for as a university. Rather, free speech and the open exchange of ideas and opinions\u2014even those that conflict with our own\u2014is an important part of student growth and preparation for success in today's global marketplace.\n\n\nThis quote is juxtaposed with President Young's words about a completely different speaker, the self-proclaimed alt-right leader Richard Spencer, who recently spoke at Texas A&M.\n\nSpencer, part of the hardline racist wing of the alt-right, shares little in common with MILO, who has had no involvement with the movement beyond reporting on it. Yet progressives and the mainstream media insists on linking MILO to the movement, in an attempt to discredit him and smear him as a racist.\n\n\nI find the views of the organizer\u2014and the speaker he is apparently sponsoring\u2014abhorrent and profoundly antithetical to everything I believe. In my judgement, those views simply have no place in civilized dialogue and conversation\u2026Outrage and indignation are emotions understandably running high; I share these sentiments. At the same time, I am also truly heartened by the clear message that the Aggie community is sending in reaction to their intrusion\u2014the firm resolve to speak up in opposition to these views, the resounding affirmation that they do not represent the Aggie values we espouse and to which we aspire, and the call to action to reject these views\u2026\n\n\nThe latter quote shows clear pandering to progressive sensitivities on campus. It also seems to suggest that, unlike Cal Poly, A&M's chief prioritizes \"Aggie values\" over the right to free speech, but that's not entirely true.\n\nAs one skeptical commenter pointed out, a very important line was omitted from the quote, hence the dot-dot-dot. In the same address, Young also stated:\n\n\n[B]arring a breach of contract and/or unresolvable safety concerns, we have no plans to prohibit the speaker from using the room he has rented. Freedom of speech is a First Amendment right and a core value of this university, no matter how odious the views may be.\n\n\nOnce again, progressives have been caught ignoring reality out of political convenience.\n\nArmstrong's unwillingness to cave to progressive demands have made him a sworn enemy of leftist groups like the Cal Poly Queer Student Union and SLO Solidarity, whose members and supporters have previously called for him to resign.\n\nIn a comment, MILO said:\n\n\u201cI welcome President Armstrong\u2019s clear defence of free speech on campus. It\u2019s a decision that\u2019ll bring him some trouble in the short term, but in the long term will pay huge dividends for his college\u2019s reputation.

At Poynter, Silverman reported \u201con trends and issues regarding media accuracy and the discipline of verification.\u201d\n\nPoynter funds\u00a0PolitiFact, which is one of the \u201cthird party organizations\u201d Facebook will use to determine real from fake news.\n\nSilverman,\u00a0dubbed a \u201cfake news expert\u201d by\u00a0Fortune,\u00a0has spent years chronicling inaccurate news reporting. He published a book about how media misinformation can \u201cpollute the press and imperial free speech.\u201d\u00a0In 2014 he\u00a0launched\u00a0Emergent, a website dedicated to tracking fake news in real-time.\n\nThe web-based startup caught the attention of BuzzFeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith. In April 2015, Smith hired Silverman to run BuzzFeed\u2019s now-defunct Canada bureau.\n\nBy June 2016, with the presidential election in full swing, Silverman\u2019s reporting had focused more on media.\n\nOn November 3, 2016, Silverman and co-author Lawrence Alexander\u00a0published a piece on BuzzFeed\u00a0identifying a multitude of pro-Trump \u201cfake news\u201d sites being run out of Macedonia.\n\nDespite the\u00a0Guardian\u00a0having published\u00a0a very similar story in August, Silverman\u2019s BuzzFeed piece\u00a0went mega-viral online. In a matter of days, the story was cited by the\u00a0New York Times,\u00a0the\u00a0Washington Post,\u00a0BBC,\u00a0Slate,\u00a0Vox, and many others and left some placing blame for the rise of fake news on Facebook.\n\n\u201c[H]ere we are, in the home stretch of a momentous election in which truthful reporting should be at a premium, and Facebook is overrun with viral dross that\u2019s misleading voters, fueling partisan rage, and\u2014according to\u00a0an analysis of the data on hyperpartisan news sites by\u00a0BuzzFeed\u00a0in October\u2014benefiting one candidate far more than the other,\u201d wrote Slate senior technology writer Will\u00a0Oremus.\n\n\u201cWho needs foreign interference when you have Facebook?\u201d Oremus\u00a0wondered.\n\nMere hours before Election Day, President Obama was rebuking the spread of fake news on Facebook.\n\n\u201cAs long as it's on Facebook\u2026people start believing it,\u201d Obama\u00a0said,\u00a0\u201cIt creates this dust cloud of nonsense.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, the impact of fake news on the election had been a hot topic long before Buzzfeed\u2019s Macedonia article.\n\nBut that story seemed to spur a spike in interest around fake news.\n\nIn the weeks after Silverman\u2019s Macedonia piece was published, Google searches for \u201cfake news\u201d skyrocketed.\n\n\n\nNow, a month after Hillary Clinton\u2019s shocking election loss to Donald Trump, \u201cfake news\u201d and foreign influencers have become the blanket excuse for her devastating defeat.\n\nIndeed,\u00a0Silverman, Clinton, and others are portraying fake news a prevailing force of foreign-based propaganda. But some of the most viral fake news stories came from sites run\u00a0by a California liberal named Jestin Coler, as reported by NPR.\n\nColer\u2019s \u201cDenver Guardian\u201d page contributed one of the five most viral \u201cfake news\u201d stories of the election, according to Silverman\u2019s own analysis.\n\nAnd while\u00a0Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and its COO\u00a0Sheryl Sandberg insist the social media site isn\u2019t to blame for Clinton\u2019s loss,\u00a0dejected Democrats, including Clinton, believe otherwise.\n\n\u201cIt's now clear that so-called fake news can have real world consequences,\u201d Clinton said last week.\u00a0\u201cIt's a danger that must be addressed, and addressed quickly. Bipartisan legislation is making its way through Congress to boost the government's response to foreign propaganda, and Silicon Valley is starting to grapple with the challenge and threat of fake news.\u201d\n\nIndeed a burgeoning bugaboo for Facebook, fake news, however, has been a boon for Silverman: earlier this month he was named BuzzFeed\u2019s first ever Media Editor.\n\n\u201cFake news has been a really extraordinary story, and it turns out it's the kind of story Craig has been kind of preparing for for some time\u2014maybe his whole life,\u201d Smith said of Silverman. \u201cCraig has already shown that he can take a really global view of the fake news story, and bring some real analytical rigor to it.\u201d\n\nSilverman, for his part,\u00a0says reporting fake news is his \u201cdestiny.\u201d\n\nAnd as fate has it, Poynter, Silverman\u2019s old employer, is partnering with Facebook to select official fact checking news organizations that will decide what is and isn\u2019t fake news on the platform.\n\nSignatories of\u00a0Poynter\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network\u2019s (IFCN) code of five fact-checking principles will now wield massive amounts of influence over what stories appear and don\u2019t appear in news feeds on the world\u2019s largest social media network. Signatories will reportedly be vetted to \u201censure compliance.\u201d Fact checking outlets that don\u2019t meet Poynter\u2019s standards will be \u201cdelisted.\u201d\n\nThere are currently six fact checking sites working with Facebook \u2014 some of them left-wing partisan groups. Snopes, for example, employs fact checkers who have far-left backgrounds, and Poynter-owned PolitiFact has repeatedly shown sympathy toward Democrats, attacked Republicans, and has been financed by left-wing billionaire George Soros.\n\nFollow\u00a0Jerome Hudson\u00a0on Twitter\u00a0@jeromeehudson", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.38871479034424, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 805, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.31110955471, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 12, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161221090000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.4906832298136599, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.09090909091}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2016/11/05/nevada-early-vote-warning-sign-trump/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [4382]}}, "headline": "Nevada Early Vote a Warning Sign for Trump", "wordcount_as_scraped": 706, "date": "20161106040000", "story_content": "Reports from Nevada on Saturday of heavy Democratic turnout in early voting, and heavy Latino turnout in particular, pose significant challenges to Donald Trump's ambitions of winning the state \u2014 and the presidency.\n\n\nFinal (almost) NV early #s are in:\nTrump is dead.\nGOP in big trouble in #nvsen, two House seats and #nvleg control.https://t.co/1pS7nvPBhmSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\u2014 Jon Ralston (@RalstonReports) November 5, 2016\n\n\n\nIf Latino votes end up denying Trump the White House, Democrats would likely see the result as poetic justice, and look forward to passing immigration reform \u2014 in a form that most Republicans would consider \"amnesty.\" But the result could also create broader political instability.\n\nThe present immigration debate is not primarily about legal immigration \u2014 though Democrats have tried to frame it as such. Rather, the debate is about illegal immigration, and what to do with millions of illegal aliens (no one knows the precise number) living in the country.\n\nMoreover, the Democrats' election message to Latinos has focused on defending the interests of illegal aliens. They have also used illegal aliens at every level of their campaign, including registering U.S. citizens to vote.\n\nIn addition, Democrats have led the effort to defy existing federal immigration law, through sanctuary cities and other policies.\n\nWhile new revelations on corruption and Obamacare have boosted Trump, those issues may not be of particular interest to Latino voters.\n\nThe political culture of many Latin American societies accepts a certain level of endemic corruption as a fact of life. And Obamacare has benefited many of the poorest Latinos, who are eligible for health insurance through the expansion of Medicaid. (In California, the state is petitioning the federal government to allow illegal aliens to be eligible as well.)\n\nThe idea that a major policy question like immigration law would be settled, in part, on behalf of those who are not actually Americans, and through the efforts of those who have helped them defy the law, will raise major questions about whether the result is just, even if the result is technically legitimate. Many Republicans will likely question the legitimacy of the result as well.\n\nFrom the point of view of social stability, the best political solution to the immigration puzzle is to have a President Trump pass immigration reform, in a Nixon-to-China gesture that involves significant compromise by both sides.\n\nRepublicans would have their \"wall,\" and a guarantee that border security will come before legalization. Democrats would have their pathway to citizenship, likely guaranteeing that most of today's illegal aliens would be tomorrow's citizens, and likely voting Democratic as well.\n\nIt would be better (though, from a Republican perspective, bad for other reasons) for Trump to lose by a landslide, in which Latino votes were only a small part of a larger story, than to lose by a narrow margin because of the Latino vote.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is one that might unfold if the Nevada result foretells a narrow win for Hillary Clinton on the basis of Latino turnout alone, because then any immigration policy changes that follow might be seen as illegal aliens imposing their will on citizens.\n\nThe tragedy of immigration policy in the U.S. is that there is one solution that is politically acceptable to the vast majority of Americans, though imperfect. It is border security first, followed by a path to citizenship once border security has been confirmed. Republicans generally want to put this issue behind them.\n\nDemocrats have deliberately frustrated the obvious solution in order to preserve the immigration issue for presidential elections \u2014 i.e. for precisely this moment.\n\nThe counter-argument to the above is familiar\u2014 that Republicans would deserve to lose for choosing candidates in two successive elections that take hard stances against illegal immigration.\n\nBut the answer to that is what happened to Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) in 2008, and what is happening to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) now. Democrats attack even Republicans who are allies on immigration. They want surrender, not compromise.\n\nThe news from Nevada could thus portend trouble for Trump, and division for America.\n\nJoel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Michael McCaul wants to run Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Homeland Security, but he has little understanding of Islam\u2019s jihad threat, says an array of anti-jihad experts.\n\n\u201cMcCaul would be a disastrous selection,\u201d said Pamela Geller, the president of the American Freedom Defense Initiative. \u201cHe represents all the failed policies of the Republican establishment\u2014the idea that Islam is a religion of peace that has been hijacked by terrorists, the idea that immigration to the US is some natural right that supersedes national security concerns, and more,\u201d said Geller, who survived an attack by two jihadis in Garland, Texas, in May 2015.\n\n\u201cMcCaul shows no sign of acknowledging, confronting, or dealing with the fact that jihadis make recruits among peaceful Muslims by invoking Islamic texts and teachings and portraying themselves as the most authentic and rigorous exponents of Islamic teachings,\u201d said Robert Spencer, the author and director of Jihad Watch. \u201cNor does he show any sign of realizing that the problem is much larger than simply one of jihad violence, and that Islamic law contains numerous elements that are incompatible with constitutional freedoms.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think an appointment of Michael McCaul to be Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security would be a disaster,\u201d said Frank Gaffney, president of the Center for Security Policy.\n\nMcCaul, who serves as Chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, called President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s proposed ban on Muslim immigration in the wake of ongoing Islamic terror attacks \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, McCaul met and was photographed with a representative from the jihad-linked Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR).\u00a0\"To Mustafa and the Council on American Islamic Relations, the moderate Muslim is our most effective weapon\u2014Michael McCaul, TX-10,\" McCaul wrote on a photograph for Mustafa Carroll, who was executive director of CAIR\u2019s Houston branch.\n\nMustafa, an Islamic moderate, proclaimed\u00a0Muslims in the United States are \"above the law of the land\" in Austin, Texas,\u00a0according to a 2015 article in the Texas Tribune.\"Following the law of the land is part of Sharia \u2026 And we follow the law of the land. In fact, Muslims, if we're practicing Muslims, we are above the law of the land. The law doesn't affect us at all,\u201d Carroll said.\n\nCAIR was officially labeled\u00a0a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe CAIR group is so closely entwined with Islamists and with jihadis that court documents and news reports show that at least five of its people \u2014 either board members, employees or former employees \u2014 have been\u00a0jailed\u00a0or\u00a0repatriated\u00a0for various financial and terror-related offenses. Evidence\u00a0highlighted by critics shows\u00a0that CAIR was named an unindicted co-conspirator in a Texas-based criminal effort to deliver $12 million to the Jew-hating HAMAS jihad group,\u00a0that CAIR was founded with $490,000 from HAMAS,\u00a0and that the FBI bans top-level meetings with CAIR officials. In 2009, a federal judge concluded that \"the government has produced ample evidence to establish the associations of CAIR\u2026 with Hamas.\"\n\nThe Texas Republican\u2019s positions have some anti-jihad activists and Islam critics shaking their heads.\n\nMcCaul is \u201con the record as supporting the Council on American Islamic Relations, whom he considers to be\u00a0\u2018moderate Muslims\u2019 and \"our most important weapon.\u2019\u2026 [But] CAIR is Hamas, immoderate in the extreme and a weapon for our enemies,\u201d Gaffney said, pointing to a recent\u00a0Center for Security Policy publication on a federal court case involving CAIR in 2007 and 2008.\n\n\u201cIt would mean more willful blindness about the threat posed by Islamic supremacists since McCaul has enabled and legitimated the Islamist-dictated \u2018Countering Violent Extremism\u2018 program, when it should have been jettisoned,\u201d Gaffney\u00a0said. In June 2016, McCaul pushed a bill that requires the FBI and other police groups to \u00a0let radical Islamic political and religious groups become intermediaries and shields between counter-terror forces and the nation\u2019s growing number of jihad-supporting Imams and Muslim immigrants.\n\nAny McCaul appointment would result in\u00a0\u201cincessant undermining\u201d of a\u00a0Trump agenda, Gaffney said: \u201cMcCaul seems committed to supporting a bureaucracy that is likely to be substantially hostile to the incoming administration.\u201d\n\nMcCaul\u2019s appointment \u201cwould mean continuity in an agency desperately needing an overhaul, since McCaul has been a supporter of the malfeasance evident in DHS under the incumbent Secretary, Jeh Johnson\u2014hence what amounted to Johnson's endorsement of McCaul's candidacy,\u201d Gaffney said. In December, Johnson told\u00a0the Washington Times\u00a0\"I don't know anybody who is stronger on border security in Congress that I have dealt with,\" referring to McCaul.\n\nPicking McCaul would not put a stop to migration to the U.S. from Muslim countries, said Geller.\u00a0\u201cIf Trump plans to remain true to the principles that got him elected, he will resolutely reject McCaul,\u201d she added.\n\nSpencer warned\u00a0McCaul \u201cis an embodiment of the half-measures taken on the basis of half-truths\u201d that have blunted the U.S. response to Islamic imperialism and terrorism since the September 11 terror attacks.\n\n\u201cMcCaul has said: \u2018Islamist terrorists have perverted a major religion into a hateful worldview, and while most Muslims do not share their beliefs, their influence is spreading like wildfire.\u2019 While this is a major improvement over the total denial and willful ignorance of the Obama administration, it still represents its own variety of willful ignorance, which could lead to continuing and serious policy missteps,\u201d Spencer said.\n\nOther pro-American immigration reformers have raised questions about McCaul\u2019s record, with one reformer calling Johnson\u2019s endorsement of his\u00a0possible appointment to\u00a0the DHS a \u201ckiss of death,\u201d and other remarking it would be extremely difficult for Trump to get his America-first agenda running under a McCaul-led DHS.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.8803825378417995, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 909, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.179841430030001, "HarmVirtue": 9, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 9, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 41, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161207050000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.510451045104509, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.72727272727}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/11/03/yazidi-iraq-feel-forgotten/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [155, 3918]}}, "headline": "With Aid Groups Focused on Mosul, Iraq\u2019s Yazidi Islamic State Victims Feel Forgotten", "wordcount_as_scraped": 794, "date": "20161104060000", "story_content": "Members of the Yazidi minority community in northern Iraq, targeted for\u00a0genocide and sexual slavery at the hands of the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL), feel abandoned by humanitarian groups and governments that have shifted their attention to the growing number of displaced persons escaping the Iraqi city of Mosul, reports Rudaw.\n\nThe Kurdish news outlet\u2019s report echoes a recent assessment by the human rights watchdog group Amnesty International, which argued that the international community has forgotten Yazidi survivors of ISIS atrocities, including women and girls who escaped imprisonment and rape by members of the jihadist group.\n\nA U.S.-backed coalition of tens of thousands of Iraqi military forces, Kurdish Peshmerga troops, Sunni tribesmen, Shiite militiamen, and Christian fighters is currently advancing towards Mosul in an effort to liberate the city from ISIS.\n\n\"We are hoping that they succeed but it doesn't change our situation here,\" said a Yazidi survivor of ISIS, identified only as Nerdis to protect her identity. \"But we are also afraid of them attacking us again.\"\n\n\"This is the problem. We have been forgotten even more. We have so many children and we don't have any money and we don't know where to go to get some,\" declared Liyla Khalil Ibrahim, another Yazidi survivor, referring to money needed to pay the ransom to free other Yazidis still held captive.\n\n\"We have said so many times about what happened to us. I don't know what to say anymore. We have 21 girls still under ISIS. Please help us get back our prisoners. That is our only wish,\" she pleaded.\n\nWhen ISIS seized large swathes of Iraq and Syria in 2014, the jihadist group captured the territory inhabited by the Yazidis, forcing many of them to flee to northern Iraq's Kurdistan region and other countries. ISIS considers members of the minority group to be devil-worshippers.\n\nWhile ISIS has forced many Yazidi women into sexual slavery, they have brainwashed some children from the minority group and coerced them into adopting ISIS's jihadi ideology.\n\nEarlier this year, Quartz reported that displaced Yazidis are being forced to live in abandoned buildings due to overcrowded refugee camps.\n\nSome Yazidis told Breitbart News around the same time that the damage to the infrastructure in Iraq's Sinjar district, their homeland, prevents many of them from returning home.\n\nCiting Dr. Ahmed Elyas Hassan from the Bajed Kandla Camp for Yazidi internally displaced persons (IDPs), located in Iraqi Kurdistan, Rudaw reports that aid from major humanitarian organizations and the regional governments has dried up over the last year and a half.\n\n\"People in Mosul are getting special treatment, but we need more,\" declared Hassan.\n\n\"The sentiment in the camp is that the major humanitarian organizations such as World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) have deserted Yazidi IDPs and completely refocused their efforts in preparation for those fleeing Mosul,\u201d notes the Kurdish news agency.\n\nThe ongoing offensive to recapture Mosul has displaced tens of thousands of people so far. Mosul remains ISIS's last major urban stronghold in Iraq and the second-largest city in the country.\n\nThe city is located in Sunni-majority Nineveh province, once the home of the largest concentration of ethnoreligious minorities in predominantly Shiite Iraq. Iraq's city of Sinjar, the Yazidi homeland, is located in Nineveh province.\n\nHassan indicated that \"the greatest challenge\" at the Yazidi camp in Iraqi Kurdistan \"is consistently obtaining a sufficient amount of medicine. Since the camp is a closed community, infections and disease run rampant among its residents.\"\n\n\"The camps are a closed community. Many diseases are distributed among them, especially the skin disease, scabies. This appears in a closed community,\u201d\u00a0Dr. Hassan told Rudaw, which points out that \u201cto combat contagions in the camp, Hassan and his staff spread awareness and look to work with the department of health from [nearby] Duhok.\u201d\n\nISIS is believed to still be holding thousands of Yazidi's in captivity, many as sexual slaves.\n\n\"Any family here has two or three people held captive in Daesh [ISIS],\" noted Hassan. \"The people in Mosul are Muslim. Daesh does not decapitate them, does not take their girls.\"\n\nDr. Hassan told Rudaw that he has sent reports to WHO, requesting assistance.\n\nNevertheless, WHO officials have denied both ignoring and receiving requests from the Bajid Kandala camp, saying they \"assist based on priority and availability of funds.\"\n\nRudaw points out that the Joint Help for Kurdistan (JHK) is the only organization providing consistent support for medical assistance at the Yazidi camp.\n\n\"However, since JHK is an NGO, they do not receive additional help from the Iraqi central government or the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and must rely solely on charitable contributions,\" it adds.\"Before, JHK was receiving help from donors in Europe, but Hassan claims that that has discontinued as well.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 16, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.060240745544429, "HarmVice": 5, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 766, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.44060899703, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 4, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 32, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161104060000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.9090909090900006, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 4.17754569190601, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/01/02/democrats-debate-recess-appointing-garland-scotus/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [111, 935, 972, 5121, 5593], "\u00a7": [3792]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 989, "scraper_regex": 1041}}, "headline": "Democrats Debate Recess Appointing Garland to SCOTUS", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1041, "date": "20170103050000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON, D.C.\u2014Rumors whispered around Washington have it\u00a0that Democrats are debating having President Barack Obama install Judge Merrick Garland on the Supreme Court by a recess appointment on Jan. 3.\n\nAll federal judges\u2014including Supreme Court justices\u2014are nominated by the president, but must also be confirmed with \"the Advice and Consent of the Senate.\" The Recess Appointments Clause, however, provides that the president acting alone can \"fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.\"\n\nAs has been the norm for a number of years now, Congress's annual session never terminated in November or December. Instead, the Senate holds short sessions every three days to keep that body open. The Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution specifies that at noon on Jan. 3, the 114th\u00a0Congress shall expire, and the 115th\u00a0Congress shall begin.\n\nMinutes before noon on Tuesday, Congress is expected to adjourn sine die, which would end the outgoing Congress, putting both the House and Senate in recess. Then precisely at noon, the new Congress would be called into session and new members sworn in.\n\nSome Democrats are pushing President Barack Obama to take those few fleeting moments to appoint Garland to the nation's highest court. If the move succeeded, then for the next twelve months the U.S. Supreme Court would have a reliably liberal majority\u2014in fact, the most liberal in all of American history. That appointment would then expire next January, at which point President Trump would be able to nominate a replacement to fill a lifetime-tenured jurist to Justice Antonin Scalia's seat. But conservatives dread the thought of what could happen during the intervening twelve months.\n\nPresident Obama tried using his recess appointment power in 2012 to force through several controversial nominees who could not get through even a Democratic-controlled Senate. His unprecedented move ended up before the Supreme Court in 2014, where the justices unanimously\u2014without a single dissent\u2014ruled his actions unconstitutional in NLRB v. Noel Canning.\n\nIn that decision\u2014the first High Court decision ever to explore the meaning of the Recess Appointments Clause\u2014the justices split between two opinions. One was an originalist opinion for the four conservative-leaning justices authored by the late Justice Scalia, whom Garland was nominated to succeed. But the majority opinion was written by Justice Stephen Breyer, for the liberal and moderate justices.\n\nUnder the controlling standard announced by the Supreme Court, Garland cannot be appointed to the Supreme Court.\n\nJustice Breyer explained in Noel Canning \"that the phrase 'the recess' applies to both intra-session and inter-session recesses. If a Senate recess is so short that it does not require the consent of the House [meaning less than three days], it is too short to trigger the Recess Appointments Clause. And a recess lasting less than 10 days is presumptively too short as well.\"\n\nThe majority continued, \"In an unusual instance, where a matter is important enough to the Senate, that body can remain in session, preventing recess appointments by refusing to take a recess.\"\n\nThe Court further held \"that, for purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause, the Senate is in session when it says it is, provided that, under its own rules, it retains the capacity to transact Senate business.\"\n\nThe Court goes on to explain:\n\nThe standard we apply is consistent with the Constitution's broad delegation of authority to the Senate to determine how and when to conduct its business. The Constitution explicitly empowers the Senate to \"determine the Rules of its Proceedings.\" Art. I, \u00a75, cl. 2. And we have held that \"all matters of method are open to the determination\" of the Senate, as long as there is \"a reasonable relation between the mode or method of proceeding established by the rule and the result which is sought to be attained\" and the rule does not \"ignore constitutional constraints or violate fundamental rights.\" United States v. Ballin, 114 U.S. 1, 5 (1892).\nIn addition, the Constitution provides the Senate with extensive control over its schedule\u2026 The Constitution thus gives the Senate wide latitude to determine whether and when to have a session, as well as how to conduct the session\u2026.\n\nFinally, the Court concluded that \"the Senate could preclude the President from making recess appointments by holding twice-a-week \u2026 sessions.\"\n\nThat is precisely what the Senate has done here. The Senate has held sessions every third day (not counting Sunday), with the most recent being Friday, Dec. 30. Under Noel Canning, this means President Obama has no recess-appointment power in the moments before the new Congress begins.\n\nInterestingly, a second way the Senate could prevent a recess appointment would be for the Senate not to adjourn at all. Per the Twentieth Amendment, at noon the previous Congress would automatically terminate by law \u2014 even if it were still in session moments before \u2014\u00a0and the new Congress would simultaneously begin. There would be no recess, and thus no opportunity for a recess appointment.\n\nThat is how the Supreme Court functions. In previous times, the Court would \"rise\"\u2014meaning end its annual term\u2014during the summer, then gavel in a new term on the first Monday of October.\n\nBut the Court no longer does so. It still stands in recess through the late summer, but never ends the official term during that time. Instead, at 10:00 a.m.\u00a0on the first Monday of each October, the chief justice gavels into session the new annual term of the Court, and in so doing, the previous term ends. There is never a moment when the Court is not functioning in one term or the other.\n\nThe Senate has its own rules, which are not the same as the Supreme Court's. But the Senate is also the ultimate judge of its own rules, and is free to work its will however it collectively sees fit. Such matters are not subject to legal challenge.\n\nEither way, it seems very unlikely that President Obama will see a third pick to the nation's highest court sitting on the bench before his successor takes the oath office as America's forty-fifth president on Jan. 20.\n\nKen Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

(2014),\" Bader states.\n\nHe wrote in 2015 at CNSNews.com:\n\nOCR's 2014 harassment guidance\u00a0generally imposes liability on institutions even if they correctly discipline those who engage in sexual harassment or sexual assault, if they do not also \"prevent its recurrence\" and \"remedy its effects,\" and it warns that even punishing the harasser \"likely will not be sufficient\" to comply with Title IX.\n\nBader continues to Breitbart News that, in a February, 2015 letter to Congress, two members of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights noted that OCR:\n\n\u2026has all too often been willing to define perfectly legal conduct as unlawful. Though OCR may claim to be underfunded, its resources are stretched thin largely because it has so often chosen to address violations it has made up out of thin air. Increasing OCR's budget would in effect reward the agency for frequently overstepping the law.\n\n\"It also is not clear that increases in OCR's caseload in recent years actually reflect much additional work,\" Bader observes. \u201cFormer Congressman John Linder has noted that OCR is extremely inefficient in handling its cases.\"\n\nBader emphasizes how the education department's \"official guidance\" policies have increased the web of bureaucracy for public schools.\n\n\"The compliance problem is exacerbated by the sheer volume of mandates\u2014approximately 2,000 pages of text\u2014and the reality that the Department of Education issues official guidance to amend or clarify its rules at a rate of more than one document per work day,\" he notes, explaining:\n\nOCR has pressured colleges and high schools to adopt unconstitutional speech codes. It also has pressured school districts to adopt veiled racial quotas in school discipline. And in sexual harassment cases, it has stacked the deck against accused students, and occasionally forced colleges to reward false allegations. It has done all these things by expanding and essentially rewriting the federal civil-rights laws Title VI and Title IX through uncodified administrative \"guidance\" and \"Dear Colleague\" letters.\n\nThe U.S. Education Department apparently fears it will be in for \"tough times ahead\" as the new Trump administration takes over in January, reports the Washington Post.\n\n\"Under President Obama, OCR has aggressively stepped up its investigation and enforcement efforts, handling a skyrocketing number of complaints even as the number of its staff has declined,\" the report says. \"The office also has issued guidance documents that have reshaped expectations for how K-12 schools and colleges handle sexual assault, deal with discipline and accommodate transgender students.\"\n\nCurrent education secretary John B. King said the number of complaints of bullying and harassment has climbed just since Election Day.\n\n\"There are too many students of color who feel afraid in school,\" he said. \"We have an obligation, all of us, to redouble our efforts to intensify our work to ensure we protect the civil rights of all students.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.5466446876525906, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1113, "FairnessVirtue": 9, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.43294683427, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 9, "mft_sum": 35, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161213020000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.14465408805031, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.1818181818199998}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/11/06/former-house-intelligence-chairman-im-100-percent-sure-hillarys-server-was-hacked/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [159, 3271, 3365, 4186, 4661, 4676, 5049, 5467]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 980, "scraper_regex": 1030}}, "headline": "Former House Intelligence Chairman: I\u2019m \u2018100 Percent\u2019 Sure Hillary\u2019s Server Was Hacked", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1030, "date": "20161106210000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 Former House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep.

In a recent piece entitled, \u201cHillary Clinton Email Case Explained,\u201d Breitbart News reported:\n\nHillary's 2008 campaign IT specialist Bryan Pagliano labored for months in a room on K Street in Washington, D.C., building the server\u00a0for Clinton to use.\nHillary Clinton kicked off her State Department career in Foggy Bottom in\u00a0January 2009 with a private Apple server, then switched to Pagliano's handcrafted server in March 2009\u2026\n\u2026Hillary Clinton went to great lengths to hide the fact that she was using a private email server. She emailed with President Obama while Obama was using a pseudonym. She kept her own State Department IT Help Desk in the dark about her secret email activities, because her private email account got flagged when she tried to send emails to her own staff. \"It bounced back. She called the email help desk at state (I guess assuming u had state email) and told them that. They had no idea it was YOU,\" Abedin told her. Clinton even paid a firm in Jacksonville called \"Perfect Privacy LLC\" to plug in phony owner names for her email network on Internet databases.\nThe server had an open webmail portal, making it easily\u00a0vulnerable to run-of-the-mill hackers. James Comey noted evidence showing hacks by \"hostile actors.\" Capitol Hill sources speak in hushed tones about the \"Russian Files,\" which are said to include information about a Russian hack. Clinton was warned of a security \"vulnerability\" on her BlackBerry on her first official trip to China, and the State Department told her to stop using it. But Clinton decided to keep using it. She told a private audience in a paid speech that\u00a0her BlackBerry\u00a0was under attack constantly by the Chinese and Russians.\nHillary Clinton had a lot of classified information on that server.\n\nBreitbart News reported that Clinton shared and posted the names of CIA-protected intelligence sources on her non-secure server, including the name of a defense attache and other agents working on issues related to Iran and the Taliban. Clinton\u2019s\u00a0email account included exact locations and travel plans for her Libyan ambassador Chris Stevens, who was killed in the Benghazi attack.\n\nThe State Department warned Clinton to stop using her Blackberry to conduct email business after the Department flagged a major security \u201cvulnerability\u201d on Clinton\u2019s first official trip to China as Secretary of State. But Clinton ignored the warning and kept using her Blackberry.\u00a0Clinton told a private audience in a paid speech:\n\nCLINTON: But, at the State Department we were attacked every hour, more than once an hour by incoming efforts to penetrate everything we had. And that was true across the U.S. government. And we knew it was going on when I would go to China, or I would go to Russia, we would leave all of our electronic equipment on the plane, with the batteries out, because this is a new frontier. And they're trying to find out not just about what we do in our government. They're trying to find out about what a lot of companies do and they were going after the personal emails of people who worked in the State Department.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.10622715950012, "HarmVice": 8, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 980, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.11222595793, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 29, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161106210000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.6363636363599996, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.9591836734693904, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/12/08/u-s-govt-china-exploiting-kashmir-tension-contain-rival-india/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "U.S. Govt: China 'Exploiting' Kashmir Tension to Contain Rival India", "wordcount_as_scraped": 555, "date": "20161208220000", "story_content": "China is increasingly providing military and economic assistance to Pakistan amid deadly confrontations between Islamabad and New Delhi over the Muslim-majority Himalayan region of Kashmir.\n\nPakistan receives more weapons from China, the world's third-largest arms supplier, than any other country, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.\n\nThe primary purpose of Beijing's assistance to Pakistan is to contain the rise of their mutual rival India, according to the most recent annual report to Congress issued by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.\n\nAlthough economically and militarily China is currently more powerful than India, the report notes:\n\nChina exploits the longstanding rivalry between India and Pakistan to ensure its own ambitions in South Asia are achieved. This strategy aims to keep India so preoccupied with its western neighbor that it will not have the ability to mount a serious challenge to China's power and influence in Asia\u2026\nChina's relationship with Pakistan has been defined by mutual animosity toward India since the early 1960s..Since then, China's increasingly sophisticated military assistance to Pakistan \u2014 particularly on missiles and nuclear weapons\u2014has been instrumental to Pakistan's ability to credibly threaten India's security.\n\nChina's assistance to Pakistan dates back to the early 1960s when China-India relations began to deteriorate over Tibet and a border dispute that included parts of the Kashmir region.\n\nPakistan and China grew closer after the 1962 Sino-Indian border war and the 1965 Ind0-Pakistani war.\n\nChina has managed to remain in the shadows of the ongoing deadly clashes between Pakistan and India along their mutual border in Kashmir.\n\nAll three countries \u2014 China, India, and Pakistan \u2014 have competing claims to the Himalayan region.\n\nChina's autonomous province of Xinjiang, home to the country's largest concentration of the Muslim Uighur minority, borders Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.\n\nThe U.S. commission reports to Congress:\n\nAlthough China has never intervened in an India-Pakistan conflict on Pakistan's behalf, its diplomatic, material, training, and intelligence support have enabled Pakistan to present a formidable military challenge to India\n\u2026\nChina's support for Pakistan is driven in large part by shared concerns about India: for China, India represents a potential challenge to China's regional dominance. For Pakistan, India represents the country's top security threat, a perception informed by their history of partition, four wars, territorial disputes, terrorism, and overall deep-seated distrust.\n\nDespite U.S. sanctions, China played an instrumental role in enabling Pakistan\u2019s ballistic missile capability in the 1980s and 1990s. Moreover, China assisted Pakistan in building its first nuclear bomb.

The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility.\n\nProsecutors have until Thursday evening to determine whether the case against the 40-year-old is strong enough for them to seek a formal arrest warrant. That would allow them to keep him in custody pending possible charges.\n\nInvestigators are trying to determine whether Amri had a support network in planning and carrying out the attack, and in fleeing Berlin. They\u2019re also trying to piece together the route he took from Berlin to Milan.\n\nItalian police have said Amri traveled through France, and French authorities said on Tuesday that he made a stop in the eastern French city of Lyon.\n\nOn Wednesday, Dutch authorities said it appeared Amri first had fled through the Netherlands, Germany\u2019s western neighbor.\n\nJirko Patist, a spokesman for the Dutch national prosecutor\u2019s office, said \u201chighly likely\u201d that Amri had been in Nijmegen, in the eastern Netherlands, during his journey from Berlin to Milan.\n\nCamera images recovered in Nijmagen \u201cfound someone we think, rather of whom we say it is highly likely,\u201d is the same person appearing in photos from Lyon in France, Patist told Netherlands public broadcaster NOS.\n\nPatist added that there was no reason to think the suspect was accompanied by anyone person while in the Netherlands.\n\nA SIM card found on the fugitive after he was shot led authorities to the Netherlands.\n\n\u201cWe can see that the SIM cards like this have been distributed in several locations in the Netherlands,\u201d he said.\n\nAmri had no phone with him in Milan, only the loose SIM card.\n\nAccording to Italian police, Amri also had a pocket knife and a few hundred euros in cash in a backpack that he was carrying when officers on a routine patrol stopped him to ask for identification in the Milan suburb of Sesto San Giovanni on Friday.\n\nHe also carried a .22 pistol that he then used to shoot a police officer, hitting him in the shoulder.\n\nThe Italian investigator said the weapon appeared to be the same one used in Germany to kill the Polish driver of the truck that was commandeered for the Christmas market attack, but that final ballistic tests were still being carried out.\n\nThe body of the Polish driver, Lukasz Urban, was returned to Poland on Tuesday, said Aldoma Lema, a spokeswoman for prosecutors in the Polish city of Szczecin.\n\nThere has been speculation over whether Urban still was alive at the time of the attack and struggled with Amri. His body was found in the truck\u2019s cab.\n\nGerman daily Bild reported Tuesday, without citing sources, that autopsy results showed Urban was shot in the head several hours before the attack and would have been dead or unconscious by that time.\n\nLema said she could not give the time of his death.

He testified that he heard someone say, \"Be careful, he has a bomb,\u201d and that he fired \"one bullet at his head to save the lives of the people at the scene.\"\n\n\"The moment I identified the danger, I acted,\" Azaria further testified. \"In the field, one second you're alive and the next second you're dead.\"\n\nIn her extensive ruling, the presiding judge in the case, Col. Maya Heller, did not accept that timeline in part because no one can be heard shouting about the explosive device in the video, which begins a full minute and fifty seconds before Azaria shot al-Sharif. Still, a civilian was identified by other witnesses as having shouted about the possibility of explosives; yet the timeline is unclear since Azaria's lawyers did not bring that civilian to testify. Also, there are many muffled voices on the video and it isn't clear what was being said.\n\nHeller did question why Azaria cannot be seen on the video warning nearby soldiers of the danger of explosives if he thought they were at immediate risk. At the same time, other military personnel at the scene as well as military experts here testified on behalf of Azaria, stating that he was justified in believing al-Sharif could have been carrying explosives and should have been viewed as a continued threat.\n\n2 \u2013 Al-Sharif was wearing a coat in mild weather.\n\n\"I was concerned because the terrorist was dressed strangely, in a furry, big, thick black coat,\" Azaria told the court.\n\nThe weather in Hebron that day was between 63.3-66.9 degrees Fahrenheit, according to weather reports. When the sun is out, it can feel even hotter. Al-Sharif was wearing a coat, which could have been used to hide an explosive device. IDF soldiers and security personnel here are trained to be on the lookout for suspicious individuals wearing jackets or coats in warm weather. Al-Sharif had already stabbed a soldier so his terrorist motivations were not in question.\n\nStill, the temperature that day cannot be considered undisputedly hot. Most civilians in the video can be seen in short sleeves, while another civilian is seen wearing a jacket. The IDF soldiers were wearing their required jackets.\n\n3 \u2013 There was a dispute about whether the terrorist was alive when Azaria killed him.\n\nAlthough the court ruled in favor of the prosecution, forensic experts testified that al-Sharif may have already been mortally wounded\u00a0when he was shot after stabbing an Israeli soldier.\n\nThe Jerusalem Post summarized the dispute thusly:\n\nThe dispute is over whether these wounds led to his death or made his death inevitable, or whether Sharif would have survived had Azaria not shot him in the head. Azaria can be convicted only if the court rules that his shot to the head was what killed Sharif.\n\nOne forensics expert, Dr. Yehuda Hiss, testified for the defense and raised questions about the autopsy carried out by Dr. Hadas Gips, who was not allowed to examine the body for 10 days due to a dispute with al-Sharif's family.\n\nJPost further reported:\n\nHiss criticized Gips' analysis as being contradicted by medical journals on what was likely to happen with Sharif's injuries from his earlier wounds. He said that scans of Sharif's wounds showed that, due to his original injuries, air that was traveling from the lungs to the heart could have caused immediate death or was about to cause his death.\n\nHe accused Gips of not performing all necessary aspects of an autopsy, listing other actions he would have taken had he performed the autopsy.\n\nIn contrast, Gips had said that such a theory for leading to Sharif's death was unlikely and unreasonable, and that there were clear signs in Sharif's body that he was alive up until the point that Azaria essentially blew his brains out.\n\n4 \u2013 Azaria operated in a highly tense atmosphere.\n\nThe incident took place in the midst of the Palestinian \"wave of terror\" of stabbings, shootings and car-rammings and IDF soldiers are one of the main targets. Hebron is particularly tense and had been the scene of multiple terrorist attacks targeting soldiers and civilians.\n\n5 \u2013 There is concern by some that Azaria's case might have been used for political purposes.\n\nInternational human rights organizations routinely condemn Israel for anti-terror activities while largely remaining silent about the use of human shields by Palestinian terrorists and the Palestinian Authority's own direct involvement in terrorist activity and anti-Semitic incitement. Still, the left in Israel has for months waged a campaign that Azaria's case must be used to send a message to the world that the Jewish state does not tolerate \"mistreatment\" of Palestinians by IDF soldiers. Supporters of Azaria are concerned that his trial may have been colored by those concerns, which were also expressed by some senior defense officials here.\n\n6 \u2013 There are disputes about what Azaria said following the shooting.\n\nA witness, identified in court documents only as T., claimed that Azaria told him right after the shooting something to the effect that \"they stabbed my friend, they wanted to kill him, so he also deserves to die.\"\n\nT. was quoted in court documents as saying, \"He was still under pressure, and I think that even he didn't really understand the gravity of his action. He said something like they stabbed my friend and tried to kill him, so he also deserved to die. \u2026 I think that Elor told the company commander [Maj. Tom Ne'eman] the same thing that he said to me, that they stabbed his friend and tried to kill him, which is why the terrorist deserved to die.\"\n\nThe ruling of the presiding judge lent considerable weight to those alleged remarks, even though T. was paraphrasing Azaria's statement.\n\nHaaretz reported on the dispute about Azaria's alleged statement:\n\nWhen first interrogated, Azaria denied that the exchange with T. had ever taken place. When the military police investigators proposed a confrontation with T., he responded somewhat differently. At the advice of his lawyer, he asked to read T.'s testimony and only then to decide whether to confront T. or not. Azaria then claimed that there was only one thing he was prepared to challenge T. on, which was that he hadn't spoken to T. before the shooting. But in court, Azaria once again claimed that he didn't recall any conversation with T. at all. When Azaria was asked if he had shot Sharif out of revenge, he chose to answer in a roundabout and evasive way, the judges wrote.\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

While this remains the most important determinant of Chinese security support to Pakistan, the rise of terrorism as a major perceived threat to China's security may be prompting a shift in this calculus as Beijing grows more concerned about Pakistan's complicated relationship with terrorist groups.\n\nTerrorist activities, primarily stemming from Pakistan and to a lesser extent Afghanistan, \"have become more frequent and high profile,\" adds the report.\n\nCiting Andrew Small, senior transatlantic fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, the commission warns of the creeping \"Islamization\" of Pakistan's military.\n\n\"According to one expert, the inability or unwillingness of Islamabad to eradicate Pakistan-linked terror threats against Chinese targets is leading some Chinese analysts to conclude that the creeping \u2018Islamization\u2019 of the Pakistani armed forces (particularly ISI) it has long supported is beginning to undermine China's strategic interests,\" it reports.\n\nThe ISI refers to Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence, which has been linked to various terrorist groups, including the Afghan Taliban. Pakistan has been accused of serving as a sanctuary for various terrorist groups by the United States, Afghanistan, India, and now China.\n\nChina, the world's third-largest arms supplier, provides more weapons to Pakistan than any other country and builds the Muslim-majority country\u2019s nuclear reactors. The communist country enabled Pakistan\u2019s indigenous ballistic missile capability and also assisted the South Asian nation in building its first nuclear bomb.\n\nMoreover, the U.S. commission notes that \"although China's relationship with Pakistan continues to be primarily based on shared security concerns, it has recently expanded to encompass economic and diplomatic components.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic terrorism threat facing China, primarily rooted in Pakistan, is reportedly intensifying.\n\nChina's autonomous province of Xinjiang, home to the country's largest concentration of the Muslim Uighur minority, borders Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and neighboring Afghanistan.\n\nAccording to the U.S. military, the Afghanistan-Pakistan region is home to the largest concentration of Islamic terrorist groups \u2014 20 of the 98 U.S. or UN-designated terrorists organizations.\n\nThe U.S. commission notes:\n\nAs the threat of extremism and terrorism facing China grows, counterterrorism has become an increasingly important facet of Beijing's engagement with South Asia. Chinese leaders have for decades been concerned about Islamic extremism and terrorism in Xinjiang, China's westernmost region and home to the majority of China's Uighurs, a mostly Muslim ethnic group.\nThe extent and nature of this threat is difficult to assess given the Chinese government's tendency to conflate and crack down on religious expression, political dissent, extremism, separatism, and terrorism. Nevertheless, open source reporting clearly demonstrates a rise in terrorist attacks in China in recent years\n\nNews outlets from India, considered a regional rival by both China and Pakistan, have accused the communist country's military of conducting regular patrols inside war-ravaged Afghanistan. China has denied the claims.\n\nNevertheless, the U.S. commission reports:\n\nChina has slowly expanded its diplomatic and security engagement with Afghanistan in recent years. China's recognition that it must shoulder greater responsibility in shaping Afghanistan's future is driven by the following factors: First, China seeks to ensure Afghanistan does not provide a safe haven for extremists who might target China.\n\nAs of early 2016, the Asian giant has reportedly pledged $70 million in military aid to Afghanistan.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 9, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.70826816558838, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 577, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.1520680897, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 12, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161209050000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.37261698440208, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2017/01/02/texas-family-suing-apple-facetime-collision-death/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 857, "scraper_regex": 49}}, "headline": "Texas Family Suing Apple Over FaceTime Collision Death", "wordcount_as_scraped": 49, "date": "20170102220000", "story_content": "Texas parents who were seriously injured and lost their 5-year-old daughter in a fatal crash on Christmas Eve in 2014 have filed a lawsuit against Apple.

On October 8 Breitbart News reported on this very gun as it was being developed by Kloepfer and he admitted that the smart gun\u2019s reader will not work if the authorized user is wearing gloves or if his fingers are dirty. Smartphone users have the same problem. And Kloepfer\u2019s fingerprint reader also failed to work if the authorized user\u2019s fingers were wet\u2013just like a smartphone.\n\nBut CBS News is euphoric because the gun is \u201crelatively reliable.\u201d And even though Kloepfer admitted the gun would not stop mass shootings, he believes his smart gun could save some lives. After all, Kloepfer says \u201cit functions almost every single time.\u201d Lost on Kloepfer and CBS are all the additional lives that could be lost when the gun does not function\u2013those represent lives that could have been saved had the victim reached for a traditional handgun that goes bang every time.\n\nMoreover, think of all the additional sexual assaults that could occur in a scenario where a firearm is only \u201crelatively reliable.\u201d Each fail could represent a horrific assault that could have ended if the victim had grabbed a classic, tried-and-true revolver.\n\nIt is interesting to note Kloepfer\u2019s admission that his gun would not stop mass shootings, because this may actually be the strongest argument against smart guns that needs to be made. In the \u201ctheory\u201d surrounding such guns, the authorized user of the weapon would be the person who passes a background check to acquire it. That would mean, the Orlando Pulse gunman\u2013who passed a background check for both his weapons\u2013would simply shoot up the place and slaughter innocents with his smart gun instead of a traditional firearm. It also would mean the San Bernardino attackers (December 2, 2016), the UCLA murder/suicide gunman (June 1, 2016), the Umpqua Community College gunman (October 1, 2015), Allison Parker\u2019s murderer (August 26, 2015), the Lafayette movie theater attacker (July 23, 2015), the Chattanooga attacker (July 16, 2015),\u00a0the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal attacker (Jun 17, 2015), the Muhammad Cartoon Contest attackers (May 3, 2014), the Las Vegas cop killers (June 9, 2015), the Santa Barbara attacker (May 23, 2014), the Fort Hood attacker (April 2, 2014), the Arapahoe High School attacker (December 13, 2013), the D.C. Navy Yard attacker (September 16, 2013), the Aurora movie theater attacker (July 20, 2012), Gabby Giffords' attacker (January 8, 2011), the Fort Hood attacker (November 5, 2009), and the Virginia Tech attacker (April 16, 2007) would have still been able to carry out their heinous acts because they all passed background checks for their weapons. The only difference would have been that they would have carried them out with a smart gun instead of a traditional firearm.\n\nIs CBS News listening? The point is clear\u2013even if smart guns worked they would not prevent evil people from carrying out evil deeds. The only thing that stops such people is an equal or greater amount of force coming at them when they try to carry out such foolishness. And that equal or greater amount of force is brought to bear by a good guy with a gun that goes bang every time, not a good guy with a gun that is \u201crelatively reliable.\u201d\n\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

McKinley said:\n\nToday, I was asked many times what the impacts of these elections would be on US-Afghanistan relations and my answer is always the same, America's long term commitment to our partnership with Afghanistan was renewed this year in Warsaw and Brussels. The US Afghan relationship will remain strong and and close because it is based not anyone election, leader or party on our common interests, our people to people ties, our shared values that so deeply rooted.\n\nOn October 21, American Brig.

The photos track the development of construction on four of the islands in the chain, which all appear to boast some kind of military asset.\n\nOn some, CSIS notes that the nature of the military assets is clear, while on others, difficult-to-identify \u201cobjects without clearly visible barrels\u201d can be seen. \u201cThese cannot be definitively identified, but are likely CIWS to protect against cruise missile strikes,\u201d the organization notes.\n\n\u201cThese gun and probable CIWS emplacements show that Beijing is serious about defense of its artificial islands in case of an armed contingency in the South China Sea,\u201d CSIS concludes, adding that these appear to be in part \u201cthe last line of defense against cruise missiles launched by the United States.\u201d\n\nChina has been developing military assets on the Spratly and Paracel island chains for years, despite the fact that these are in international waters and claimed by neighboring countries. Chinese officials have previously maintained that the facilities on these islands were strictly civilian, however, intended\u00a0to track climate change and deploy rescue missions for wayward maritime vessels.\n\nBeijing has regularly maintained that most of the South China Sea is exclusive Chinese territory due to \u201cancient\u201d claims, though six\u00a0other nations claim parts of the sea: Brunei, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. As China does not recognize Taiwanese sovereignty, it has asserted that any Taiwanese claims are actually China\u2019s.\n\nDespite the more overt military functions of its new assets in the Spratly Islands, the Chinese Foreign Ministry once again said in a statement responding to the CSIS report that its constructions are \u201cmainly for civilian use,\u201d though ominously adding, \u201cIf someone makes a show of force at your front door, would you not ready your slingshot?\u201d\n\nIn a separate statement, Reuters notes, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang referred to the military facilities as \u201cnormal\u201d and condemned freedom of navigation exercises on the part of the United States and other powers. \u201cThe Nansha [Spratly] islands are China\u2019s inherent territory. China\u2019s building of facilities and necessary territorial defensive facilities on its own territory is completely normal,\u201d he said.\n\nIn remarks earlier this week, U.S. Pacific Command head Admiral Harry Harris warned that China had become increasingly \u201cassertive\u201d in the South China Sea and that the U.S. military would inevitably have to respond to Beijing\u2019s belligerence.\n\n\"We will not allow a shared domain to be closed down unilaterally no matter how many bases are built on artificial features in the South China Sea,\"\u00a0he said in Sydney, where he also announced that a concerned Australia would allow the U.S. to fly missions out of using its most highly-developed fighter aircraft.\n\n\"I'll be blunt in saying that the global operating system that created the Indo-Asia-Pacific economic miracle is coming under pressure from revisionist powers,\" he said, adding that there was \"no room for subtlety\" in challenging\u00a0China and a \u201crevanchist\u201d Russia.\n\nThe Global Times, a Chinese propaganda outfit that often publishes some of the more militaristic and anti-American opinions\u00a0in Chinese media, immediately pounced on Harris\u2019s statements. \u201cHarris is perhaps the most senior US military leader to have regularly spoken such tough rhetoric against China in the past years,\u201d a column published following his statements argues. \u201cBecause of this high frequency, Chinese people have grown numb to his words, including his talk about how his forces must be ready \u2018to fight tonight.'\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s legitimate and reasonable for China to deploy defensive weapons on its own islands. It doesn\u2019t need to ask for anyone\u2019s permission,\u201d the\u00a0Times continues. \u201cIt is the US that has been flexing its muscles by deploying 14 F-22 jets to Japan previously and then to Australia. The Pentagon has never bothered to ask for Beijing\u2019s permission in advance.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.7510316371917702, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 675, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 1.4316377952700001, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161216070000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.22222222222222, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2016/12/02/texas-lawmakers-ink-constitutional-spending-limit/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [566, 3430, 3577]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 535, "scraper_regex": 566}}, "headline": "Texas Lawmakers Ink Constitutional Spending Limit", "wordcount_as_scraped": 566, "date": "20161202170000", "story_content": "The Texas Legislative Budget Board (LBB) adopted a constitutional spending limit on Thursday that curbs budget growth to eight percent over the next two years.\n\nUnder the restriction, spending will increase slower than personal income is projected to grow over the next two years.\n\nThe limit was adopted with a unanimous vote of the board.\n\nThe board meets on or before December 1 every year. In the meetings, it adopts an estimated rate of state economic growth and a spending limit for the next legislative session.\u00a0The 85th Texas Legislative Session begins on the second Tuesday in January of every odd-numbered year. This year the Texas Legislature convenes on January 10, 2017.\n\nThe LBB is charged with determining the estimate rate of growth of the state\u2019s economy by dividing the estimated Texas total personal income for the next two years by the estimated Texas total personal income for the current biennium. Texas law states, \u201cUsing standard statistical methods, the board shall make the estimate by projecting through the biennium the estimated Texas total personal income reported by the United States Department of Commerce or its successor in function.\u201d\n\nLieutenant Governor Dan Patrick and House Speaker Joe Straus co-chair the Legislative Budget Board.\n\nAccording to a document presented to the Senate Finance Committee by the LBB in mid-May of this year, the Texas Constitution contains four spending limits on Lone Star State elected representatives. They are a: (1) Debt limit; (2) Welfare spending limit; (3) Pay-as-you-go limit; and (4) Limit on the growth of certain appropriations. The latter is what is referred to as the \u201cSpending limit.\u201d\n\nThe LBB represented that the 2016-17 budget was within all of the foregoing limits.\n\nThe \u201cSpending Limit\u201d can be found in Article VIII, Section 22 of the Texas Constitution. It was approved by voters on November 7, 1978. The provision states that \u201c(a) In no biennium shall the rate of growth of appropriations from state tax revenues not dedicated by this constitution exceed the estimated rate of growth of the state\u2019s economy. The legislature shall provide by general law procedures to implement this subsection.\u201d\n\nTexas Government Code Chapter 316 provides the general law pertaining to the Spending Limit and it directs the LBB to establish:\n\nIt also requires that the rate of growth be defined as the growth in personal income.\n\nThe Constitutional Spending Limit applies to tax revenue that is not dedicated by the Texas Constitution. Those appropriations controlled by the limit include: sales tax; motor vehicle sales tax; franchise tax; cigarette and tobacco taxes.\n\n\"The people of Texas elected us to produce a conservative budget that ensures that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and that government growth does not exceed increases in inflation and our population. Today\u2019s vote by the Legislative Budget Board underscores our firm commitment to that belief,\u201d Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas.\n\n\"Today's vote will allow the Legislature to produce a balanced, responsible state budget,\" said House Speaker Joe Straus. \"It will also allow us to make strategic investments in priorities such as education, child protection and mental health care. The House will continue to practice fiscal discipline while addressing the core needs of our growing state.\"\n\nLana Shadwick\u00a0is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

Stock markets are booming, oil prices are on the rise again and the risks of a rapid economic slowdown in China, a major source of concern a year ago, have eased,\" Reuters' Noah Barkin writes from Davos, Switzerland, at the annual summit of the world's elite. \"And yet, as political leaders, CEOs and top bankers make their annual trek up the Swiss Alps to the World Economic Forum in Davos, the mood is anything but celebratory. Beneath the veneer of optimism over the economic outlook lurks acute anxiety about an increasingly toxic political climate and a deep sense of uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidency of Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated on the final day of the forum.\"\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald's Clancy Yeates has a piece detailing how this year's World Economic Forum at Davos\u2014at which Chinese president Xi Jinping will speak, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel will not\u2014there is a focus on the \"backlash\" voters worldwide have delivered against globalization.\n\n\"Chief executive pay has become a powerful symbol of the widening gap between the winners and losers created by globalisation, and boards must put more focus on justifying the bonuses they pay executives amid a backlash against free-market policies,\" Yeates writes. \"That is the view of the chairman of the Australian Institute of Company Directors, Elizabeth Proust, one of the Australian business leaders attending the powerful summit in Switzerland this week. The annual meeting of the global economic and political elite, in a town in the Swiss Alps, takes place against a backdrop of growing inequality in many countries, seen as a key driver for anti-establishment political shocks including Brexit and Donald Trump\u2019s win.\"\n\nThe globalists at Davos still don\u2019t seem to fully understand what is happening, as the World Economic Forum's website published a column from Robert Muggah of the Igarape Institute with a headline stating boldly: \"Populism is poison.\" He and co-author Misha Glenny, a writer and broadcaster, advocate for \"plural cities\" to defeat populism.\n\nPopulism is poison. Plural cities are the antidote, says Robert Muggah https://t.co/sJrn7oQAqN pic.twitter.com/dkywZl1526\n\u2014 World Economic Forum (@wef) January 15, 2017var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([\"embed\"]);\n\n\n\n\"If cities are to defeat populism, they need to know what it is,\" Muggah and Glenny write. \"According to Princeton's Jan-Werner Muller, at the core of populism is a profound rejection of pluralism. It is animated by two basic ideas \u2013 an opposition to diversity and a rejection of the so-called establishment. Populists contend that outsiders threaten the national way of life and that 'the people' need to exclude outsiders. The antithesis of the people is, oddly, migrants.\"\n\nPopulists aren't likely to slow their winning streak any time soon. Globalization is on the decline everywhere in the world, from Guatemala\u2014which elected a television comedian, Jimmy Morales, as its president back in late 2015\u2014to Italy, whose recent referendum led to the resignation of prime minister Matteo Renzi. Obviously, America just elected Donald Trump and the British voted to leave the European Union. French and German presidential elections in 2017 threaten to see the potential rise of ultra-populist Marine Le Pen and the possible demise of mega-globalist Angela Merkel all in one fell swoop. \n\nIt's unclear if Merkel will go down, or if Le Pen will win in France. But that we're even at this point where it's possible is remarkable in and of itself. Le Pen spent the past few days in New York City, making a surprise appearance at Trump Tower hoping for a meeting which she didn't get with the president-elect. Merkel, meanwhile, is clearly scared enough of a potential electoral loss in 2017 that she's skipping her regular appearance in Davos at the World Economic Forum so as to avoid providing populist opponents of her globalism with any ammunition heading into this year. It comes on the heels of her pledge to ban burkhas in her speech announcing she intends to stand for re-election, a complete reversal from a leading open borders advocate who's perhaps singlehandedly overseen the importation of millions of Muslims into mainland Europe including Germany.\n\nThe New York Times' Michael J. de la Merced and Russell Goldman detail how the World Economic Forum has, for decades, been the exclusive annual hang-out for the world's political, financial and cultural elites\u2014a place where they gather together, and celebrate themselves.\n\n\"The annual meeting runs on a tiered system of colored badges denoting just how important one is, or is not,\" Merced and Goldman write. \"White badges are for attendees able to attend any official event and make full use of the forum's facilities. Orange badges are reserved for the 500 journalists who cover the forum, but are not allowed at some parties. Other badges, like purple ones, denote technical or support staff and limit their holders to a few areas. If that system were not complicated enough, local hotels like the Belvedere and the InterContinental often sell their own badges to the bankers and consultants who descend upon Davos \u2014 but not the forum itself \u2014 to strike deals and chat up clients. These souls camp out at the hotels, renting rooms for business meetings by day and soiree hopping at night.\"\n\nWhile most of the official events are things like lectures, speeches, panels and discussions, the Times writers highlight some of the \"more esoteric attractions\" like \"a simulation of a refugee's experience, where Davos attendees crawl on their hands and knees and pretend to flee from advancing armies.\"\n\nThere are also lots of parties and schmoozing behind the scenes, where the elites bond together.\n\n\"There are several official cocktail receptions, but the action really lies in a galaxy of events hosted by corporations. Some are small, intimate dinners that feature the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio and Bono,\" Merced and Goldman write. \"Others are dazzling affairs: JPMorgan Chase, for example, has previously taken over the Kirchner Museum Davos for drinks with its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, and Tony Blair, the former British prime minister. Google's annual party at the InterContinental Hotel has become the hottest ticket in town. The investor Anthony Scaramucci, now an adviser to Donald J. Trump, for years has hosted a reception at the famed Hotel Europe featuring a sometimes eye-popping list of high-end Champagne and Bordeaux red wine. A more recent up-and-comer is hosted by Salesforce.com, a business software maker, whose chief, Marc Benioff, is one of the forum's most ardent boosters. Last year's Salesforce party included Mr. Benioff flying in scores of fresh flower leis and a band from Hawaii, as Eric Schmidt of Google and other tech notables danced in a corner. Several years ago, Sean Parker of Napster and Facebook fame, hosted an over-the-top gathering that featured stuffed animal heads shooting laser beams out of their eyes. And the Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska has thrown opulent gatherings at a nearby villa where the Champagne flowed freely For a nightcap, the Davos crowd traditionally retires to the Tonic Bar at Hotel Europe, sipping cocktails while the forum fixture Barry Colson leads the crowd in Billy Joel singalongs.\"\n\nAt last year's Davos, the elites were certain the people of the world would never vote for things like Brexit or Trump or the Italian referendum. In other words, all was well.\n\n\"Last year, the consensus here was that Trump had no chance of being elected. His victory, less than half a year after Britain voted to leave the European Union, was a slap at the principles that elites in Davos have long held dear, from globalization and free trade to multilateralism,\" Barkin wrote in Reuters.\n\nThis year, though, it's a much gloomier affair in Davos. These world elites have found out, thanks to voters worldwide, they're no longer the center of the universe. Financial elites are losing control on the world markets while political elites are losing control of international governments and cultural elites are seeing their star power fade.\n\n\"Trump is the poster child for a new strain of populism that is spreading across the developed world and threatening the post-war liberal democratic order,\" Barkin adds. \"With elections looming in the Netherlands, France, Germany, and possibly Italy, this year, the nervousness among Davos attendees is palpable.\"\n\nAnd now, the gloomy affair in the Swiss Alps is getting even more depressing. According to Bloomberg's Matthew Campbell and Simon Kennedy, those at Davos are even beginning to wonder if they're \"part of the problem.\"\n\n\"Did the global elite's devotion to borderless capitalism sow the seeds of a populist backlash?\" reads the subhead of a recent Bloomberg piece from Campbell and Kennedy.\n\nThe piece quotes Harvard professor and former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Kenneth Rogoff as admitting that Davos is never correct.\n\n\"A joke I've told 1,000 people in the months since leaving Davos is that the conventional wisdom of Davos is always wrong,\" Rogoff said. \"No matter how improbable, the event most likely to happen is the opposite of whatever the Davos consensus is.\"\n\nThe elites at Davos are worried as the working class folks worldwide have stormed their castles and disrupted their lovely lives, the Bloomberg writers say, and they don't find it very funny.\n\n\"The repeated failure of business and political elites to predict what's coming\u2014last year, that included the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union\u2014doesn't strike those returning this month to the Swiss Alps as very funny,\" Campbell and Kennedy wrote. \"After a year in which political upsets roiled financial markets and killed off the careers of once-dominant Davos-going politicians, the concern for delegates attending this year's meeting isn't that their forecasts are often wrong, but that their worldview is.\"\n\nPopulists shouldn't take this as proof the war is over: The globalists will always try to fight back. There's even rumblings that Party of Davos regular former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a disgraced ex-GOP leader who lost his own primary election back in 2014 to now Rep. Dave Brat (R-VA), may try for a political comeback down the road. But if past is prologue, it's unlikely these world elites will regain power and authority over the people who took their power away in the first place.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.0365520715713499, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1672, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 10, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.1570464280299997, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170115210000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 1.4354066985645901, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/2nd-amendment/2016/12/14/abc-news-obama-big-talk-little-action-guns-sandy-hook/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [994, 1194, 1692, 1760, 1818, 1888, 2459, 2546, 2626, 2779, 3022]}}, "headline": "ABC News: Obama Big Talk, \u2018Little\u2019 Action on Guns Since Sandy Hook", "wordcount_as_scraped": 548, "date": "20161215020000", "story_content": "December 14, 2016, marks four years since the heinous attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School, and ABC News is using the day to draw attention to how President Obama\u2019s emphasis on gun control has largely been coupled with failure to secure any new gun laws.\n\nThe Sandy Hook attack was carried out by a gunman who stole his firearms, killed his own mother with one of the weapons, and thereafter, went to the school and killed 26 innocents. Democrats seized on the attack as an opportunity to pass gun control. They pressed for universal background checks in Manchin/Toomey, and Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) pushed an \u201cassault weapons\u201d ban. Obama supported both measures, yet both went down in flames. This was largely because neither action would have stopped another Sandy Hook attack.\n\nSenator Joe Manchin (D-WV), after whom the gun control in Manchin/Toomey was named, admitted his bill would not have prevented the attack,\u00a0and because Sandy Hook Elementary was a gun-free zone, the fact that an AR-15 was used was not as important as the location in which the attack occurred. In other words, the gunman had more than nine\u00a0minutes inside the school without armed resistance. In that setting, with that amount of time, even a gunman armed with a rudimentary firearm, such as a revolver, could have caused unimaginable havoc.\n\nSandy Hook Parent Nicole Hockley, now co-founder of the gun control group Sandy Hook Promise, lamented the inability to pass universal background checks after the tragedy. She said that \u201cin theory,\u201d those checks were \u201cthe easiest legislation to pass,\u201d yet they could not be secured. Nonetheless,\u00a0she gives Obama, Manchin, and others \u201can \u2018A\u2019 for effort.\u201d\n\nABC News\u00a0is not passing out As for effort. Rather, the news outlet\u00a0suggests Obama talked a lot about gun control and did not deliver. It\u00a0reports, \u201cYet for all the words, Obama has made little federal progress toward what he has repeatedly described as \u201ccommon-sense gun laws.\u201d It is, the outgoing president has acknowledged, one of the biggest regrets of his time in the White House.\n\nIt is crucial to remember that the key reason for Obama\u2019s defeat in this area is that he and his fellow Democrats were pushing gun control that would not have prevented another Sandy Hook.\n\nParis, for example, has the kinds of laws Obama wanted\u2013universal background checks and bans on entire categories of firearms. Yet it\u00a0also had 130 innocents gunned down in cold blood on November 13, 2015.\n\nCalifornia has\u00a0universal background checks and strict limitations on \u201cassault weapons,\u201d yet it\u00a0also had 14 innocents shot and killed in the December 2, 2015, San Bernardino attack.\n\nWashington state has universal background checks, as well, yet it\u00a0had a mass shooting in a Burlington mall on September 23, 2016.\n\nThe bottom line is that gun control laws empower criminals and terrorists while placing law-abiding citizens in an indefensible position. The American people know this, which is\u00a0why they have rejected the gun control push by Obama and his fellow Democrats.\n\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of \"Bullets with AWR Hawkins,\" a Breitbart News podcast.

Immigration laws exist \u201cto preserve the quality of life in American communities and job opportunities for Americans,\u201d she said, adding,\u00a0\u201cIt is not just about terrorism.\u201d\n\nAnother concern about McCaul, said Vaughan, is that McCaul cannot overcome Democratic opposition even on his own committee. \u201cHe got outmaneuvered in a lot of incidents by the minority Democrats because they knew the rules better than he and his staff did,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cIf he could not even manage the procedure of getting votes on his committee, how is he going to manage a huge agency?\u201d she asked.\n\nMcCaul\u2019s office did not respond to questions from Breitbart.\u00a0\n\nMcCaul\u2019s prior focus is far distant from the broad and ambitious reform promised by Trump on August 31: \"The time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system \u2026 to keep immigration levels, measured by population share, within historical norms \u2026 to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first.\"\n\nIn a September 2016 economics speech, Trump declared that \u201cevery policy decision we make must pass a simple test: does it create more jobs and better wages for Americans?\u201d\n\nUnder President Barack Obama, the federal government annually imports at least one million legal immigrants, plus almost one million temporary\u00a0white-collar guest workers\u00a0and blue-collar guest workers for jobs sought by Americans. Those two million new foreign workers \u2014 plus the roughly eight million illegal immigrants in jobs \u2014 compete against the four million young Americans who begin looking for jobs each year. That wage-cutting competition shifts roughly $500 billion per year from wages and salaries into company profits, boosting investors and Wall Street.\n\nThe DHS is a critical agency in the management of the nation\u2019s huge annual inflow of visitors, immigrants, and guest workers, alongside the departments of Labor, Justice, and State.\u00a0\n\nMcCaul's new op-ed somewhat shifted his 2015 focus from terrorism towards illegal immigration, but still ignores Trump\u2019s promise to protect Americans\u2019 jobs and wages from legal immigration \u2014 not just from illegal migrants. \u00a0\n\n\"Donald Trump campaigned on a big promise: he would secure our border and confront the illegal immigration crisis head-on,\" McCaul says at the start of his Dec. 2 op-ed.\n\nAfter about 500 words about illegal immigration, McCaul briefly turns his attention to American workers.\u00a0\"In the meantime, we can't forget about American workers,\" he wrote.\n\nBut he immediately\u00a0shifted his op-ed back to illegal immigration, not legal immigration. \u201cWe've got to protect our economy by mandating the use of E-Verify to ensure illegal aliens are not taking away American jobs,\u201d McCaul said in the remaining part of the paragraph. The initial E-Verify system was created in 1997, and now it is used voluntarily by\u00a0a huge number of companies. But the GOP-run congress has not passed a bill to make its use mandatory whenever an employer checks the work-eligibility of a new hire. \u00a0\n\nMcCaul does mention the impact of \"visa overstays,\" \u2014 people who arrive legally but overstay their visas and often seek jobs sought by Americans. \"I will also see to it that we catch people who violate their visas by putting in place a rigorous entry-exit system to track foreigners who overstay their welcome,\" he said.\u00a0\n\nBut McCaul did not acknowledge that congressional GOP leaders \u2014 including himself \u2014 have quietly refused to fund the deployment of an entry-exit system\u00a0to track when visitors overstay, even though Congress has authorized the deployment multiple times since 1996. In 2014, roughly 480,000 foreigners visited the United States and overstayed their visas for some period of time\n\nMcCaul did briefly mention the much-criticized guest-workers programs that Trump has promised to revamp so they cannot be used to replace Americans. \"We've got to protect our economy \u2026 by re-examining foreign guest worker programs,\" said McCaul.\u00a0But McCaul's brief reference to the guest worker programs was focused in the programs' impact on the U.S. economy, not on their impact on Americans' wages and salaries, Vaughan noted.\n\nIn March 2016, Trump promised to protect Americans from the guest worker programs, such as the H-1B program, which outsources at least 650,000 white-collar jobs to foreign guest workers living in the United States: \u201cI will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program,\u201d he said \u201cNo exceptions.\"\n\nIn August 2016, Trump laid out his pro-American immigration policy in an Arizona speech:\n\n\nThe truth is, our immigration system is worse than anyone realizes. But the facts aren't known because the media won't report on them, the politicians won't talk about them, and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up.\nToday you will get the truth.\nThe fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful politicians. Let me tell you who it doesn't serve: it doesn't serve you, the American people.\nWhen politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following: amnesty, open borders, and lower wages.\nImmigration reform should mean something else entirely: it should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.\n\u2026\u00a0 most illegal immigrants are lower-skilled workers with less education who compete directly against vulnerable American workers, and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they will ever pay in\u2026\nWe will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet.\nWe will ensure that E-Verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law, and will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country.\nImmigration law doesn't exist just for the purpose of keeping out criminals. It exists to protect all aspects of American life \u2013 the worksite, the welfare office, the education system and much else. That is why immigration limits are established in the first place. If we only enforce the laws against crime, then we have an open border to the entire world.\n\u2026 The time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals \u2026 [including] to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first.\n\n\nRead the full text here.\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 9, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.16731512546539, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1313, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 14, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 7, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 12.280468938699999, "HarmVirtue": 13, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 44, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 7, "mft_max": 44, "mft_sum": 98, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161206180000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 7.46382330540746, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 8.909090909089999}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/01/08/chicago-police-board-chair-need-federal-help/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 501, "scraper_regex": 550}}, "headline": "Chicago Police Board Chair: Windy City Needs Federal Help to Turn Tide on Crime", "wordcount_as_scraped": 550, "date": "20170109040000", "story_content": "During a January 7 interview on NPR, Chicago Police Board Chairwoman Lori Lightfoot said Chicago cannot end the city\u2019s violence alone \u2014 they need federal help.\n\nChicago\u2019s Lightfoot \u201calso chairs Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s Police Accountability Task Force.\u201d\n\nAccording to NPR, Lightfoot said:\n\nWe need to have more federal gun prosecutions in Chicago. Our federal partners from the U.S. attorney\u2019s office, the ATF, the FBI need to be much more invested in this overall strategy. Chicago Police Department cannot tackle this issue by itself.\n\nLighfoot\u2019s statement came less than a week after President-elect Donald Trump tweeted:\n\nChicago murder rate is record setting \u2013 4,331 shooting victims with 762 murders in 2016. If Mayor can't do it he must ask for Federal help!\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017\n\n\n\nThink about it \u2014 Chicago saw over 4,300 shootings for the year and nearly 800 murders, yet the left greeted Trump\u2019s tweet with disdain. That disdain was epitomized by Nicole Gonzalez Van Cleve, who used a CNN op-ed to claim:\n\nAs with many of the President-elect\u2019s tweets, we are forced to speculate as to the content of that federal \u201chelp,\u201d but certainly Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric gives us plenty of evidence to understand his approach to criminal justice policy and more broadly, his views of people of color. Thus far, he has proposed a crackdown on communities that have suffered gravely from violence as well as a crisis of confidence in policing. This tough-on-crime strategy is fueled by Trump\u2019s own ignorance of the communities most impacted by violence and his inability to account for the political and social causes that create violence.\n\nMaybe Van Cleve should have consulted Lightfoot before belittling Trump\u2019s offer of federal help. Had she done so, she would have seen that Lightfoot also mentioned the problems resulting from a lack of confidence in policing. But Lightfoot suggested these problems cannot be used as an excuse to continue down a path which obviously isn\u2019t working:\n\nIn our history in this country, the police have been used as a bludgeon against communities of color, particularly black folks in the segregated South and frankly in the North in enforcing Jim Crow laws. We know that history, so this is not an easy and delicate topic. But it\u2019s one that we have to dive in, we have to embrace because I said before I\u2019m 100 percent convinced that if we don\u2019t take steps in each other\u2019s direction to try to address this strained and fractured relationship, those communities that are most in need, those people that are most desperate for quality and effective policing, they\u2019re going to be further victimized by the failure in that relationship.\n\nA quick aside \u2014 If Lightfoot and Van Cleve really want to be honest about the past, they should be sure to point out that Democrats were the authors of Jim Crow and the authors of southern segregation. These things, along with gun control, were part of the Democrats\u2019 plan for communities of color.\n\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of \"Bullets with AWR Hawkins,\" a Breitbart News podcast.

The funding battle over sanctuary cities and other jurisdictions has intensified and expanded to \u201csanctuary campuses.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives in the U.S. Congress are fighting back, and state governments are gearing up for fights.\n\nAfter the President\u2019s\u00a0election in November, colleges and universities started declaring their educational institutions to be\u00a0\u201csanctuary campuses\u201d and \u201csafe spaces\u201d for illegal aliens, and they have been issuing resolutions that would actually prohibit campus police from cooperating with Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Students at Sanford University in November were one of the first to march and demand that the university be used as a shelter for illegal aliens facing deportation, reported Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cThe controversy has only heightened with Trump's election,\u201d \u00a0Baltimore County (Maryland) Executive Kevin Kamenetz said during an interview on Full Measure with Sharyl Attkisson\u00a0Sunday. \u201cThere have been demonstrations at more than a dozen colleges and universities. At least nine of them have declared themselves to be sanctuary campuses \u2014 promising various levels of non-cooperation with U.S. authorities to protect their illegal immigrant students.\u201d\n\nBreitbart Texas reported on January 3rd that\u00a0Representative Andy Harris (R-MD) introduced the \u201cFederal Immigration Law Compliance Act of 2016\u201d (FILCA). He did so along with co-sponsors \"from California to New York, to Florida,\u201d according to his website.\n\nHarris\u2019 bill prohibits any entity from receiving\u00a0federal\u00a0funding that \u201cdoes not comply with a lawful request for information or detainment of an alien made by an officer or employee of the Federal government who is charged with enforcement of the immigration laws from receiving additional funding.\u201d\u00a0If passed, the law would apply to any entity, including institutions of higher learning. These institutions would be forced to comply with all lawful requests made by ICE or forego federal funding.\n\n\"Congress has the responsibility to protect the rule of law in our country and provide for the safety of our citizens. We need to focus on protecting American citizens and those who are in this country legally, instead of providing shelter for those who have violated our immigration law and entered this country illegally,\" Rep. Harris said in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. According to the Congressman, his\u00a0bill would explicitly authorize \"federal immigration authorities to make requests for information regarding illegal immigrants of any institution or entity receiving federal funds.\"\n\nU.S. Representative Duncan Hunter (R-CA) recently introduced legislation that would remove billions in federal funding from universities unless they cooperate with federal immigration authorities. The bill would require the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to keep tabs on which institutions of higher education were creating an immigration fortress for illegal immigrants. Federal funds for financial aid and loans for students would no longer be available.\u00a0Hunter is the congressman who, as reported by Breitbart News, personally took down\u00a0a painting being displayed in the Capitol complex depicting police officers as pigs violating the civil rights of minorities and blacks in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nThe California congressman filed a bill in December that would take away Title IV funding from universities and colleges that provide in-state tuition to illegal immigrants, as reported by Breitbart Texas. Duncan\u2019s\u00a0No Funding for Sanctuary Campuses Act\u00a0removes\u00a0federal funding from any college or university that gives a taxpayer-supported public benefit of in-state tuition. \"It is the sense of the Congress that providing the public benefit of in-state tuition to an alien who lacks lawful immigration status in the United States creates an incentive for illegal immigration and encourages and induces aliens to come to, enter,\" the bill expressly states.\n\nThe responsive actions to the sanctuary policy battle by the congressmen and others follow action by a Texas representative, John Culberson (R-Houston), who worked with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to enforce existing law. The U.S. law requires \"100 percent\" compliance with federal immigration requests sent to state and local law enforcement jurisdictions, Breitbart Texas reported in November.\u00a0\"Sanctuary cities and other jurisdictions will now have to choose between protecting illegal aliens and receiving federal law enforcement grants,\" Culberson told Breitbart Texas at the time.\n\nIn early January, Pennsylvania Representative Lou Barletta introduced a bill which would defund sanctuary jurisdictions that protect illegal immigrants by not cooperating with immigration officials. Barletta told Breitbart Texas in an interview this past week, \u201cNot one cent. These mayors, sheriffs, and state leaders are thumbing their noses at federal immigration law. The only way to stop them is to hit them in their pocketbooks.\"\n\nState officials are also taking aim at sanctuary policies. In the Lone Star State, Texas Governor Greg Abbott has vowed to cut funds for any sanctuary city or campus.\u00a0Moreover, as reported by Breitbart Texas\u2019 Bob Price, \u00a0\u201cA showdown is looming in the Texas Legislature over in-state tuition benefits for the children of illegal immigrants as the two top leaders of the state's legislative bodies are at odds on the issue.\u201d The speaker of the Texas House, Joe Straus (R-San Antonio) believes the current law allowing in-state tuition for illegal immigrants is \u201cperfectly acceptable.\u201d The Lieutenant Governor, who presides over the Texas Senate, strongly opposes the law. Moreover, Texas State Senator Charles Perry (R-Lubbock) pre-filed a bill in November that would require local governments in the state to uphold current immigration laws.\n\nLana Shadwick\u00a0is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

If that\u2019s true\u2013if more guns concentrated results in more killings\u2013then why do the states with the loosest gun laws have the lowest murder rates?\n\nTucker pointed to \u201cVermont, Wyoming, Maine, and Idaho,\u201d but Horowitz interjected to say \u201cthat\u2019s not true\u201d based on the fact that there are higher murder rates in some states with looser gun laws. Horowitz was pointing to exceptions to the rule and attempting to use those exceptions to overturn the rule when Tucker replied, \u201cI\u2019m not arguing that there is a direct correlation between looser gun laws and lower murder rates. I\u2019m merely arguing that gun control doesn\u2019t make us safer.\u201d\n\nTucker said gun control\u2019s impotency is \u201cpretty obvious\u201d based on the homicide numbers in Chicago during 2016 and he asked Horowitz how can he continue to push gun control in light of the Chicago failure.\u00a0Horowitz gave a convoluted answer full of little bits of information that he finally tied together by saying, \u201cWe really believe the evidence is showing that, in fact, a group of gun violence prevention laws, in fact, do lower the homicide rate.\u201d\n\nA quick aside\u2013On January 2, 2017, Breitbart News reported:\n\nChicago has played host to decades of gun control experiments, including an all-out handgun ban from 1982-2010.\u00a0Yet 2016 witnessed 779 homicides in the city, and over 9 out of 10 of those were firearm-related. And even after the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit struck down\u00a0Illinois' ban on concealed carry in December 2012, city leaders fought to make implementation of concealed carry as difficult as possible. For example, on September 15, 2013,\u00a0American Thinker reported that Mayor Rahm Emanuel was fighting to block off sections of the city where concealed carry permit holders would be barred from carrying guns for self-defense.\nThese and other gun controls ultimately do one thing\u2013they make it difficult for law-abiding citizens to acquire and carry the guns they need for self-defense, while doing nothing to curtail the behavior of criminals, who will always acquire and carry the guns they use in crime.\nFast-forward to 2016 and Chicago's gun-control legacy\u2013779 homicides, more than 9 out of 10 of which were committed with a firearm.var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([\"embed\"]);\n\nNow the handgun ban, the ban on concealed carry, and the fight against allowing freedom of movement for concealed carriers were all part of a group of laws that Democrats in Chicago trusted to the lower the homicide rate. Instead, the homicide rate rose. In fact, it surged, and this is evident to everyone except those who do not want to see it.\u00a0Therefore, after Horowitz re-espoused his belief that \u201ca group of gun violence prevention laws\u2026do lower the homicide rate,\u201d Tucker pointed to the thousands of shootings in Chicago last year\u2013and the nearly 800 homicides\u2013and said, \u201cWhat gun laws would have prevented that?\u201d\n\nHorowitz responded by blaming Chicago gun crime on guns \u201cfrom other states.\u201d He named \u201cWisconsin, Mississippi, and Indiana\u201d as states that are flooding Chicago with guns and said the solution is to expand universal background checks to all states.\n\nTucker said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard this argument but, New York City has seen a dramatic drop in gun crime, right?\u201d\n\nHorowitz said, \u201cRight, and they have great gun laws.\u201d\n\nTucker then pounced, \u201cBut it\u2019s right south of Vermont, which has the laxest gun laws in America. You can get in a car and drive up there. So why isn\u2019t that the same?\u201d\n\nHorowitz exact response: \u201cWell, well, cause, first of all, New York, New York, it\u2019s the same thing as Illinois where, where the crime guns are coming from out of state\u2013but New York lives in a much safer neighborhood, right, you have to go quite some distance to get a firearm.\u201d\n\nTucker said, \u201cReally?

The forefront. That bombing campaign was an unmitigated disaster, contributing to the collapse of state structures in Libya and the division of the country into three (at least) warring parts, and leading to a situation where hundreds of thousands of Libyans had to flee to Tunisia while many more risked the savage journey to Europe in order to escape the clutches of Islamist radicals who filled some of the gaps left by the end of Gaddafi rule.\"\n\n\nHe added: \"Sorry, no.

Instead, the aim is to \"end the occupation\", and on this basis it secured its funding,\" Simons writes.\n\nIt appeared, therefore, that these former soldiers, some of whom draw salaries from Breaking the Silence, were motivated by financial and political concerns to further a pro-Palestinian agenda. They weren't merely telling the truth about their experiences. They were under pressure to perform.\nIndeed, I later discovered that there have been many allegations in the past that members of the organisation either fabricated or exaggerated their testimonies.\n\nHonestReporting.com asked why the New York Times failed to acknowledge that Rachel Kushner wrote her article with a clear agenda.\n\n\"Given that Kushner was exposed to only one side of the issue due to the involvement of Breaking the Silence, it explains why she would not have spoken to anyone from the Jerusalem municipality that bears responsibility for Shuafat,\" the article reads.\n\nThe watchdog cites Israeli journalist Avi Issacharoff who said that even local residents of Shuafat estimate the number of weapons held illegally by people in the camp to be in the thousands.\n\n\"The level of crime is also unusual compared to any other place in Israel or the West Bank,\" Issacharoff notes.\n\nThe refugee camp is also known as a \"terror stronghold,\" and according to Israeli security sources is home to a significant number of terrorists who have carried out attacks against Israel.\n\nKushner notes that several of the \"young assailants\" responsible for stabbing and other attacks in the recent surge of Palestinian violence have come from the camp. She describes a bizarre scene at a barbershop run by a group of youths who share the family name Alqam. She recounts their \"collective joy\" at being there.\n\n\"We were all ecstatic,\" she writes, describing how her interpreter was \"playfully coerced [into receiving a] beard trim, on the house\" while she and the boys \"shouldered up for selfies, put on our sunglasses and posed.\"\n\nThe ostensible purpose of describing such a scene was to convey, as she notes in the very next paragraph, \"how wonderful it was in the Shuafat camp. How safe I felt.\"\n\nLater on in the article Kushner writes how after arriving back home to America she had looked up the name Alqam and came across reports that \"two Alqam boys, cousins who were 12 and 14, had been accused of stabbing, with a knife and scissors, an Israeli security guard on a tram in East Jerusalem.\" While she writes that she is unsure of whether they were related to the boys in the barber shop, another New York Times article, published shortly after the terror attack, includes interviews with several members of the extended Alqam family in the camp.\n\nThe article notes that at first, members of the Alqam family \"expressed similar doubts\" about Israeli reports of the attack. It goes on to say that even after irrefutable video evidence was released of the Alqam boys carrying out the attack, \"there was no sign of contrition in the refugee camp, nor any indication that the adults might restrain their children.\"\n\nTaken together, HonestReporting.com notes that the Jerusalem municipality and the Israeli police may be \"loathe to put their lives at risk to give services\" to the refugee camp \u2013 one of Kushner\u2019s chief grumbles. It further notes that \"the camp is largely serviced (evidently not very well) by UNRWA,\" the United Nations' agency for Palestinian refugees.\n\n\"We already know that the New York Times presents a one-sided view of Israel and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But to publish an article like Rachel Kushner's without the transparency that professional journalism requires is highly problematic,\" the article concludes.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.04032278060913, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 959, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 9, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.64317543809, "HarmVirtue": 6, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 33, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161206160000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.4410844629822703, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.0}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/12/05/government-report-blames-tolerance-regressive-cultures-segregation/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1896, 3018, 3034]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 652, "scraper_regex": 686}}, "headline": "Government Report Blames \u2018Tolerance\u2019 of 'Regressive Cultures' for Segregation", "wordcount_as_scraped": 686, "date": "20161205150000", "story_content": "More pressure should be put on migrants to integrate, as \"regressive religious and cultural ideologies\" are taking root as the UK struggles to cope with the pace and scale of immigration and becomes increasingly segregated, a government report has said.\n\nThe extensive review, by cohesion adviser Dame Louise Casey, recommends \"robust\" measures such as actively promoting the English language and a new \u201coath of integration\u201d enshrining British values for those who hold public office.\n\nDame Louise claims that complacent politicians and religious bosses have failed to act decisively for 15 years, as too many were \"worrying about being labelled racist\" or \"hoping it might change\".\n\nConsequently, she found whole towns have changed \"out of all recognition\" because of mass migration and that some Muslim communities, in particular, have fostered \"regressive\", sexist, and harmful ideologies.\n\nThe report represents a signification change in rhetoric from ruling elites, as the blame and responsibility for ending segregation is placed on migrants, rather than mainstream British society being expected to adapt to newcomers and foreign cultures.\n\n\nExcellent report out by Dame Louise Casey on migration and pace of change.

It's the misogyny and patriarchy that has to come to an end, and leaders that are Muslim and not Muslim need to unite,\" Dame Louise\u00a0told the BBC.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHer report points out that \"economic inactivity levels remain unusually high among women from Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnic groups \u2013 57.2 per cent are inactive in the labour market compared with 25.2 per cent of White women and 38.5 per cent of all ethnic minority women\".\n\nRegarding future immigration, the importance of British values should be emphasised early on, she said. \"Increased integration expectations are to be set out earlier in the immigration process.\"\n\n\"We need more effort to be put into integration policies to help communities cope with the pace and scale of immigration and population change in recent years\", Dame Louise added.\n\nThe report was commissioned by former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron, but was welcomed by senior Labour Party MP Chuka Umunna, who recognised the problems it raised in a statement this morning.\n\n\"The fact people live parallel lives in modern Britain has been swept under the carpet for far too long and deemed too difficult to deal with, which has left a vacuum for extremists and peddlers of hate on all sides to exploit,\" he wrote.\n\nHowever, speaking about record immigration levels into the UK on Sky News this morning, the party's immigration spokesman Diane Abbott would not say numbers were too high, insisting Labour did not \"in principle, believe in setting targets\".", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 15, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.34173679351807, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 652, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.4387474966300005, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 9, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 15, "mft_sum": 39, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161205150000, "FairnessVice": 3, "pct_mft_words": 5.9815950920245395, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.54545454545}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/11/01/sen-harry-reid-aims-to-criminalize-politics-because-of-fbi-investigation/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [819, 1957, 2687]}}, "headline": "Sen. Harry Reid Aims to Criminalize Politics over FBI Investigation", "wordcount_as_scraped": 682, "date": "20161101170000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) is accusing FBI Director James Comey of violating federal law. That\u2019s leading senior elected officials to express alarm over what they call an attempt to criminalize law enforcement.\n\nFBI agents discovered 650,000 emails to and from Huma Abedin\u2014Hillary Clinton's closest aide and confidant\u2014when those agents examined a computer as part of a federal child pornography/pedophile criminal investigation of Abedin's husband, disgraced former Rep. Anthony Weiner. At the same time, at least four FBI field offices\u2014Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, New York City, and Little Rock, Ark.\u2014were also investigating possible law-breaking and corruption (\"pay for play,\" etc.) with the Clinton Foundation.\n\nWhen Comey announced he had\u00a0reopened the criminal investigation into Clinton's emails, the Far Left threw out its glowing praise of Comey from the summer (such as House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi's extolling Comey, saying, \"We are privileged in our country to have him be director of the FBI\"), and is now excoriating him as a Republican political hack (news that would shock everyone involved with Republican Party politics).\n\nBut Senate Minority Leader Reid took this to a new level, accusing Comey not only of being political, but of breaking federal law. Reid alleges that Comey violated the Hatch Act, which makes it illegal for a federal officer to use the powers of the government to support or oppose a particular candidate.\n\nThe Hatch Act was designed to prevent federal officials from abusing their power to deliberately interfere in a federal election.\n\n\"Once again, Harry Reid is going over the top,\" says Ken Blackwell, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Human Rights Commission and senior elected official, one of the most prominent and respected Republican leaders of the past quarter-century.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s husband Bill Clinton \u00a0won the White House in 1992. Days before that election, Justice Department investigator Lawrence Walsh went public with an indictment of Reagan Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger regarding Iran-Contra, casting a shadow on President George H.W. Bush right before Election Day.\n\n\"Clinton supporters didn't run to the cameras back then to condemn a federal law enforcement investigator making such an announcement as people were getting ready to vote when the shoe was on the other foot,\" Blackwell quipped.\n\n\"This is just the latest episode in the criminalizing of politics,\" Blackwell continued. \"In this case, Comey had shocked Republicans by not recommending indictments in July. It's absurd to say that when the evidence shows\u00a0he needs to reopen a criminal investigation that somehow he's breaking the law by doing his job to enforce the law.\u201d\n\n\"It's Comey's job as head of the FBI to investigate possible violations of federal criminal law,\" Blackwell added. \"No candidate is above the law.\"\n\nSaying that the FBI cannot examine possible evidence that any candidate\u2014including a presidential candidate\u2014has broken the law, would essentially mean police agencies should not treat those investigation subjects the same way any private citizen would be treated. It suggests that powerful elites in this country don't have to follow the same laws that ordinary Americans must follow. The narrative that establishment elites should be held to the same standards as everyday Americans has been a central thrust of Donald Trump's campaign.\n\n\"No candidate is 'too big to jail,'\" Blackwell explained. \"Having worked closely with U.S. presidents, I can tell you that the power radiating from the Oval Office is staggering in its scope.\"\n\nWhen there's a possibility that a person within reach of acquiring such massive power is in fact a criminal, he continued, \"every American should want law enforcement to do its job and investigate that possibility before you make that person the most powerful person in the world.\"\n\n\"Even the White House is backing Comey on this,\" Blackwell concluded. \"Reid needs to rein in his rhetoric before criminalizing politics becomes so toxic that we get the kind of political corruption I had to confront in some countries we don't want to emulate when I served our nation as an ambassador.\"\n\nKen Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

In the case of so-called sanctuary cities, it also manages to overwhelm our otherwise well-honed commitment to the rule of law.\n\nNext year, Travis County will welcome a new sheriff, Sally Hernandez, into office. The sheriff-elect has taken a careless stance on immigration in that she has fervently and publically rebuked her predecessor's policy of cooperating with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, when it requested that the sheriff's office hold inmates so that they might be removed from the country.\n\nWere we to take the sheriff-elect's campaign promises at face value, Austin would be the first Texas municipality to fully qualify as a \"sanctuary city.\"\n\nThe sheriff-elect defends her radical departure of existing law by attempting to wrap immigration enforcement in a swath of social justice causes. She doesn't think, for instance, that \"you solve the criminal justice process by deporting them.\" Likewise, she calls ICE's policies \"discriminatory\" and has urged for a more \"progressive\" approach to \"treat everybody fairly and equally.\"\n\nNever mind that ICE's current deportation standards originated in the Obama Administration which, at least since 2011, has chiefly focused its enforcement effort at undocumented immigrants convicted of the most violent and heinous crimes.\n\nPopular attacks aside, the government has little interest in breaking up families; nor do they seek to deport victims who bring incidents of misconduct to the attention of authorities.\n\nHernandez's reasoning is one of ideology, not facts. It advances a narrative that lauds the appearance of compassion towards immigrants but never truly confronts the policy's substance or how non-compliance can hurt the very audience that sanctuary cities are said to help.\n\nHad Hernandez done so, she would have realized that sanctuary cities are the policy equivalent of a dead end. Nothing moves forward. Not public safety. Not the rule of law. Certainly not the men, women, and children who thirst for the American Dream but have had the forbearance to pursue it through appropriate means.\n\nIndeed, our nation enjoys a proud history of lawful immigration. You might even call it our country's cultural backbone. And you would be hard pressed to find a constituency on either side of the political aisle who wants that tradition to stop.\n\nSanctuary cities, however, implicate different concerns.\n\nExit polls in the last presidential race showed that President-elect Trump won a higher percentage of the Hispanic vote than the Republican Party's two previous nominees. He secured that margin even though the experts had anticipated that his rhetoric against sanctuary cities and illegal immigration would hobble him in the Hispanic community.\n\nThe results are hardly a surprise when you actually take the time to learn about what matters to voters. According to that same exit poll, voters understood that lawlessness hurts immigrants who seek to enter the country legally since it makes it more difficult, more expensive, and more time-consuming to navigate the process.\n\nThe United States is a generous nation, but policymakers are unlikely to widen the entranceway if the halls are already crowded.\n\nIn addition, by cutting holes into the federal government's enforcement fabric, sanctuary cities imperil public safety. Dangerous criminal elements now know that if deported, they have a safe place to land upon reentry\u2014places like Denver, Seattle, New York City, Philadelphia, Austin.\n\n\"Kate's Law,\" named for murder victim Kate Steinle, mandates prison terms for those with multiple deportations and is a response to San Francisco's sanctuary city policies, which fails to provide for the protection of its citizens.\n\nEven here in Texas, where sanctuary cities have yet to gain full traction, residents have suffered from repeat offenders able to exploit holes in our immigration laws. Nicodemo Coria-Gonzalez was deported multiple times, only to return and commit a series of rapes in the Austin area. He's a prime example of the criminal element which will be emboldened by the sheriff-elect's renegade policies.\n\nWe cannot allow individuals to avoid justice and accountability. We cannot allow sanctuary cities to harbor these criminals. We cannot allow city officials to skirt the law at their whim.\n\nThis upcoming session, the Texas Legislature will make ending sanctuary cities a top priority. Already, several bills have been filed to that effect, including S.B. 4, which would allow law enforcement to investigate a suspect's immigration status as well as demand that municipalities implement immigration laws already on the books.\n\nGovernor Greg Abbott has endorsed the sentiment behind these efforts, promising \"to sign a law that bans sanctuary cities.\" He also tweeted, \"I\u2019ve already issued an order cutting funding to sanctuary cities\" in the meantime.\n\nLt. Governor Dan Patrick has echoed with his own support: \"No city in Texas should be allowed to ignore the law. We will end this practice once and for all this session.\"\n\nSanctuary cities argue for keeping illegal immigrant families together, yet they ignore that Kate Steinle's family is forever shattered. Americans overwhelmingly understand that one of our first duties as a nation is to protect our citizens.

But owners may not be expecting overnight relief \u2013 many recognize it will take time to see what the administration\u2019s plans are, and what it will accomplish.\n\nBusiness owners were considerably more optimistic about 2017 in a survey taken shortly after the election. Forty-six percent of the 600 questioned in the Wells Fargo survey said the operating environment for their companies would improve next year; that compares to 30 percent two years ago, after the last congressional elections. Just over half the owners said actions that Trump and Congress will take next year will make their companies better off. Twenty-six percent said the government\u2019s actions would have no effect, and 17 percent said their businesses would be worse off.\n\nNick Braun expects his pet insurance business to benefit because he thinks consumers will feel more comfortable about buying nonessentials like health coverage for their pets.\n\n\u201cI truly believe that 2017 will not only be a great year for our business, but the U.S. economy in general,\u201d says Braun, whose company, PetInsuranceQuotes.com, is based in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nBraun thinks promised changes to the health care law will be one factor encouraging consumers to spend on things that aren\u2019t their top priorities. He\u2019s also hoping that changes to the law will make it easier for him to buy insurance for his six staffers, which he provides even though the law doesn\u2019t require him to. He says he\u2019s had to change carriers several times because many insurance companies haven\u2019t wanted to write policies for small businesses.\n\nSome companies that cater to other small businesses see the hopefulness in their customers, and it\u2019s infectious.\n\n\u201cThe election does give me more optimism than I would have had otherwise,\u201d says Kurt Steckel, CEO of Bison Analytics, which does software consulting. Bison\u2019s inquiries from prospective clients, small companies that are looking to expand, have nearly doubled since the election.\n\nSteckel is also upbeat about an overhaul of the health care law. He says the cost of his small group insurance rose sharply when the law went into effect, and he had to stop offering coverage to his 10 staffers. He says if insurance were to become more affordable, he\u2019d restore coverage.\n\nAmong the other laws and regulations that small business advocacy groups want to see eliminated or changed are the Department of Labor\u2019s overtime rules that were scheduled to go into effect Dec. 1, but were put on hold by a federal court in Texas. Trump\u2019s nominee for labor secretary, fast-food company CEO Andy Puzder, opposes the regulations.\n\n\u201cThe decision to appoint Puzder as labor secretary is a big indication that there\u2019s going to be a significant rollback of Obama administration initiatives,\u201d says James Hammerschmidt, a labor and business lawyer with the firm Paley Rothman in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nFederal laws and regulations are only part of the requirements that small businesses must comply with \u2013 state and local governments in some parts of the country have more stringent laws and rules. For example, while the federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, many states and some cities have a higher minimum, with plans to raise it to as much as $15.\n\n\u201cSmall business owners whose companies are located in more progressive jurisdictions or operate across local or state borders will have to deal with a patchwork of local and state employment laws that may be difficult, time-consuming and likely aggravating to navigate,\u201d Hammerschmidt says.\n\nMany owners may be cautious in the first half of 2017 while they wait to see what the government does, particularly with health care, says Walt Jones, owner of a management consulting business, SEQ Advisory Group, whose clients include small companies. He also expects owners who do business with the government wait to see if federal agencies increase the number of contracts they award to small companies.\n\nJones is optimistic that Trump\u2019s pledge to improve the country\u2019s roads and other parts of its infrastructure will mean more government contracts, and in turn, more business for his company.\n\n\u201cAs long as the administration sticks to the promises he (Trump) made during the campaign, I definitely see opportunities for small businesses,\u201d Jones says.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.37614679336548, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 807, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.4629485789400003, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161228150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.9826517967781898, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/12/22/trump-demands-u-s-veto-un-security-council/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [2399, 2677, 3701]}}, "headline": "Trump Demands Obama Veto UN Security Council Resolution on Israeli Settlements", "wordcount_as_scraped": 591, "date": "20161222150000", "story_content": "President-elect Donald J.

As Breitbart News reported last week, several other countries were also considering various resolutions aimed at declaring Israeli settlements illegal.

Much of the area was to have been an Arab state according to a UN plan passed in 1947, but the surrounding Arab states went to war against Israel, and Jordan occupied the territory until 1967. The Palestinians consider all Israeli development across the 1949 armistice line \u2014 including in East Jerusalem, which was annexed by Israel shortly after winning the Six Day War in 1967 \u2014 to be illegal.\n\nThe Obama administration has adopted a version of the Palestinian position on the issue, referring to Jewish neighborhoods in Jerusalem that happen to be across the \u201cGreen Line\u201d as \u201csettlements.\u201d\n\nTrump has\u00a0promised to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from the coastal city of Tel Aviv \u2014 where most western embassies are \u2014 to West Jerusalem, which is entirely on sovereign Israeli territory and is home to the Israeli Knesset (parliament), the High Court, and much of Israel\u2019s national\u00a0government.\n\nIsrael considers both East and West Jerusalem to be one city. The Old City is on the eastern side, and was off-limits to Jews during the period of Jordanian occupation, which also saw the ancient Jewish neighborhood of the city largely destroyed.\n\nTrump\u2019s nominee for U.S. Ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, reportedly favors the Israeli position.\n\nAccording to NBC News, Israel\u2019s UN Ambassador Danny Danon said: \u201cIt is absurd that at a time when thousands are being massacred in Syria, the Security Council is devoting time and energy to convene and discuss condemning the only true democracy in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nIn the past, the U.S. has vetoed such resolutions at the Security Council, but the lame-duck Obama administration has suggested it will not do so, in a parting shot at the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 and at Trump.\n\nJoel B.

On the Colombian border, many Venezuelans in Western T\u00e1chira state do not look to stay: they cross the border whenever possible to buy food in neighboring C\u00facuta, Colombia. Dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s attempts to shut the border \u2013 including the expulsion of Colombian nationals in raids using what Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos described as \u201cnazi ghetto tactics\u201d \u2013 largely failed.\n\nThe Brazilian border, less populated and boasting a much more lush forest terrain, has been more difficult to secure. There, the\u00a0Washington Post estimates that 10,000 Venezuelans are crossing into Brazil on a monthly basis, most looking to buy food and medicine.\u00a0The booming markets in previously sleepy Pacaraima prompted Maduro to respond in the same way he did to C\u00facuta: shutting the border, claiming it a necessary measure against black market business.\n\nUnlike in Colombia, the Brazilian government is struggling to aid the flood of Venezuelans on its border.\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0reported last month that doctors working on the Venezuelan border are rapidly running out of supplies, morgues are overwhelmed with the bodies of the terminally ill looking for a last chance, and bordering\u00a0Roraima state was forced to declare a state of emergency.\n\nBrazilian officials, like their Colombian counterparts, have responded to the problem by urging Venezuela\u2019s socialist government to change its repressive policies. \"The immigration issue can only be fixed when you deal with the problem at the origin, not at the \u00addestination,\" Brazilian immigration official Gustavo Marrone lamented to the\u00a0Post.\n\nFurther north, in Mexico, Venezuelans are increasingly seeking work permits, or at least jobs. More Venezuelans sought work permits in Mexico in the past year than any other group, including Americans, Spaniards, Chinese, and Cubans, according to a report published in Mexican media in July. The number of migrants seeking work permits increased 20 percent between May and June 2016 alone.\n\nVenezuelans are now among the most populous applicants seeking asylum in the United States, as well. Pew reported in August that more than\u00a010,000 Venezuelans sought to move to the United States between October 2015 and June 2016, a 63 percent increase from the number in the same period a year before. Throughout the fiscal year 2016, the number of asylum requests from Venezuela increased\u00a0168 percent. And they are not choosing the obvious Latin American migrant destinations as homes, either; of particular note appears to be the burgeoning Venezuelan community in Utah.\n\nThose\u00a0the Utah\u00a0Daily Herald spoke to who moved to Utah were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (LDS), a minority in Venezuela. Just as they chose to use their religious identity as a compass, so, too, are Venezuelan Jews increasingly flocking to Israel to remake their lives. More than double the number of Venezuelans moved to Israel in 2015 than did in 2012, according to the\u00a0Washington Post.\u00a0\"I feel hopeful in Israel; it's a country filled with social innovation and opportunities,\" one of these migrants,\u00a0Reisy Abramof, told the\u00a0Post.\n\nVenezuelan nationals moving to the United States, Pew notes,\u00a0\u201chave higher levels of education than Hispanic immigrants overall\u201d and tend to be fluent in\u00a0English more often; similar statistics are not available for migrants to Israel, though the difficulty of traveling so far and the strict Israeli immigration laws may indicate a similar pattern exists. This may belie that poor Venezuelans appear to be fleeing the country as much as the better economically situated.\n\nMiami\u2018s El Nuevo Herald reported last week on a destination that appears to be taking in more of these Venezuelans: the Dominican Republic, where 170,000 Venezuelans moved to in 2016.\u00a0Many of those interviewed, the report notes, were once socialists. \u201cWe are a rich nation,\u201d lamented one Venezuelan while selling arepas, a type of corn bread, on a Dominican street. \u201cThis is an embarrassment. I never wanted to leave my country.\u201d\n\nStill more Venezuelans have taken to another Caribbean country: Trinidad and Tobago. The dual island nation\u2019s officials note that the actual\u00a0number of Venezuelans entering the country on tourist visas has dropped by half, while the number of Venezuelans living in the country appears to be increasing, a sign of increased illegal immigration. \u201cThe government\u2019s concern is that this deficit [of tourist visas] is entering illegally to stay,\u201d an expert tells\u00a0El Confidencial.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 17, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.817986965179441, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 847, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.8446954889, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170106010000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.5419126328217203, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/01/16/obamas-wet-foot-dry-foot-repeal-leaves-cubans-stranded-airports/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e1": [432, 801, 3000, 3590], "\u00a0": [507, 901, 915, 1194, 1218, 3011, 3019, 3034, 3093, 3151, 3601, 3615, 3936], "\u00f3": [423], "\u00e9": [929, 2627], "\u00fa": [428, 3927], "\u00ed": [3024, 3606, 3614]}}, "headline": "Report: Airport Officials Detain Cubans with Legal Visas in \u2018Wet Foot/Dry Foot\u2019 Chaos", "wordcount_as_scraped": 707, "date": "20170117040000", "story_content": "Activists helping Cuban-American families in Miami say that Cubans landing in the United States with legal tourist visas are being detained and deported following President Barack Obama\u2019s repeal of the \u201cwet foot/dry foot\u201d immigration policy this month.\n\n\u201cThese Cuban travelers have tourism visas.

Cuban tourism visas do not grant a specific amount of time a tourist can remain in the United States; that decision is made by a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol official at their discretion upon the individual entering the country.\n\nPresident Obama repealed a separate executive measure commonly known as \u201cwet foot/dry foot\u201d earlier this month. That decree allowed for all Cuban nationals who touch U.S. soil to be automatically considered legally present in the United States. The end of \u201cwet foot/dry foot\u201d was intended to affect Cubans who took to the high seas attempting to escape the communist dictatorship on makeshift vessels. It remains unclear why the end of this policy has triggered the scenario occurring to individuals with legal tourist visas this weekend in Miami International Airport, though those affected appear to be Cubans who notify Customs and immigration authorities that they intend on invoking the Adjustment Act to stay in America. Others were detained simply for mentioning the act.\n\n\u201cI asked if the Cuban Adjustment Act was still around and [the immigration official] shrugged,\u201d a 73-year-old Cuban woman who declined to give her name told Miami\u2019s Am\u00e9ricaTeVe this weekend. \u201cThey sat me there from the morning until 10PM without food,\u201d she lamented. \u201cThey kept shifting us from room to room without telling us what happened.\u201d\n\nThe woman says she slept on the airport floor overnight and was finally freed when authorities were convinced she was not lying about coming to America to celebrate her birthday with her son.\n\n\n\nS\u00e1nchez told\u00a0Miami\u2019s\u00a0Mart\u00ed Noticias\u00a0that he saw another case of an old man detained for making\u00a0a comment that appeared suspicious to an airport officer.\u00a0Authorities allegedly stripped a man of his tourist visa after asking him whether he feared staying in the United States, to which he replied with some confusion, \u201cwhy would I fear that?\u201d\n\n\u201cSome [older Cubans] who have gotten out say that authorities are pressuring them, saying, \u2018if you want to stay, we have to take you to a detention center\u2019 and those with advanced age think \u2018if you\u2019re going to throw me in jail just send me back,'\u201d S\u00e1nchez told\u00a0Mart\u00ed.\n\nMart\u00ed\u00a0estimated that one hundred Cubans were stranded overnight on Saturday at Miami International Airport as airport officials did not allow them to meet their families and exercise the rights of their tourism visa.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s announcement of a new policy legitimizing the communist government of dictator Ra\u00fal Castro\u00a0triggered a large increase in the number of Cubans seeking refuge in America. According to U.S. Customs, the number of Cubans allowed to stay in the United States increased by nearly 10,000 between 2014, when President Obama first announced the \u201cnormalization\u201d process, and by 13,000 between 2015 and 2016, when President Obama visited Cuba and enjoyed Castro\u2019s hospitality at an exhibition baseball match.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 21, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.31958770751953, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 694, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 6.19517274087, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 21, "mft_sum": 41, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170117040000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.9077809798270895, "mft_mean": 3.72727272727}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/01/23/iraq-freed-caliphate-cubs-proud-islamic-state-jihadis/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [851, 1629, 1867, 1888, 2580, 3864, 4860]}}, "headline": "Iraq: Freed \u2018Caliphate Cubs\u2019 Still \u2018Proud to Be\u2019 Islamic State Jihadis", "wordcount_as_scraped": 780, "date": "20170123190000", "story_content": "Children formerly captive under the Islamic State remain committed to the jihadist ideology into which they have been brainwashed, posing a threat to the Kurdish communities receiving civilians liberated from Islamic State-held areas in Iraq.\n\nThe Kurdish outlet Rudaw reports on attempts in the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) territory of northern Iraq to keep civilians safe from the \u201cCaliphate cubs,\u201d many of whom spent months being indoctrinated in Islamic State terrorist training camps. In Duhok, a Kurdish-held city near the Islamic State territory of Mosul, authorities have relegated teen minors who vow allegiance to the Islamic State to its prisons.\n\n\"Sixty-eight juveniles [since last year] have been held prisoner in our jail,\" Duhok\u2019s head of juvenile detention,\u00a0Zaki Salih Musa, told Rudaw. He notes that these children are not all Arab Muslims; many are Kurds, and some are Yazidis who renounced their religion for Islam. The Islamic State considers Yazidis \u201cdevil worshippers,\u201d claiming their supreme god, Melek Taus, is a representation of Lucifer. Yazidis believe that the angel known in the West as Lucifer served his penance in hell and has returned as a representative of God before humanity.\n\nMusa tells Rudaw that paramount among concerns that officials have regarding these minors is that they have been trained to be proud of the Islamic State and continue to kill throughout their lives. \"Those who have been arrested on charges of terror are not feeling remorseful and they are still proud of being ISIS,\u201d he tells the outlet.\u00a0Musa says the situation is unprecedented for him: \u201cI have been working in this reforms center for 15 years, all the arrestees have had expressed regret for their crimes,\u201d except the \u201cCaliphate cubs.\u201d\n\nThe Islamic State has used \u201ccubs\u201d at\u00a0the forefront of its\u00a0propaganda efforts, releasing videos that depict both teens and toddlers committing gruesome murders, with jihadis vowing to the West that the Islamic State will continue to exist for generations to come. The group has released \u201ctraining\u201d as well as \u201cexecution\u201d videos, showcasing terrorist training camps in which children recite the Quran, learn how to shoot, and make improvised explosive devices (IEDs).\n\nThere is no concrete estimate of the number of children the Islamic State has captured and brainwashed, though individual cases of mass abduction indicate that number has surpassed one thousand in the past three years. As recently as last Thursday, local Iraqi outlets reported that\u00a0Islamic State terrorists abducted as many as 150 children from Tal Afar, northern Iraq.\n\n\"The Islamic State is training children that were abducted from Tel Afar, Yazidi families and Mosul's families to kill civilians and security members using booby-trapped vehicles and explosive belts,\" Iraq\u2019s State of Law Coalition member Nahla al-Hababi told reporters. Mass graves found throughout Iraq and Syria indicate that not all children went forcibly, and many were killed for refusing to convert to Islam or fight alongside the terrorist group.\n\nChildren do not only serve as executioners in controlled Islamic State settings; the group forces them to fight in battle against Kurds, Iraqi soldiers, and other coalition members. An estimated 300 children, believed to be Syrian \u201ccubs,\u201d were killed in battle in the first two weeks of the operation to liberate Mosul, the second-largest city in Iraq and the Islamic State\u2019s regional capital.\n\nThe Islamic State aims to create an oppressive, sharia-governed government for Sunni Muslims only. Its goals are not only military, but social, and as such, it has implemented a number of tactics designed to destroy other civilizations. Abducting Kurdish and Yazidi children and forcing them to fight for the jihadi cause is one of them. In its\u00a0targeted genocide against the Yazidi people, abducting women and girls and forcing them into sex slavery remains a main vehicle of oppression.\n\nFor years, the Islamic State has operated a Yazidi sex slave market in Iraq, raiding villages, abducting the women and girls, and selling them for as little as ten cigarettes. The women are then systematically raped by their \u201cowners\u201d and often sold and re-sold, and getting pregnant in the process.\n\nRepeatedly raping and impregnating Yazidi women is meant to guarantee that, should the women return to their conservative communities, they will be seen as \u201cunmarriageable,\u201d their children the product of rape by Muslim men. Women and girls who escaped the Islamic State were subjected to \u201cvirginity tests\u201d upon their return, for the information of prospective suitors. This has led many Yazidi survivors to illegal abortions, ostracism, and suicide.\n\nTo combat the Islamic State\u2019s campaign against Yazidi society, the head of the religion, Baba Sheikh\u00a0Khurto Hajji Ismail, issued a statement in 2014 urging communities to accept former sex slaves as members of their community.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.33496332168579, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 744, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 8, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.35256162083, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 1, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170123190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.16666666666667, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/news/the-latest-indonesia-earthquake-death-toll-rises-to-102/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1117, "scraper_regex": 1215}}, "headline": "The Latest: Indonesia earthquake death toll rises to 102", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1215, "date": "20161208050000", "story_content": "MEUREUDU, Indonesia (AP) \u2014 The Latest on a magnitude 6.5 earthquake in Indonesia\u2019s Aceh province (all times local):\n\n___\n\n11:10 a.m.\n\nA spokesman for Indonesia\u2019s National Disaster Mitigation Agency says the death toll from Wednesday\u2019s earthquake has risen to 102, spread across three districts in northern Aceh but concentrated in Pidie Jaya near the epicenter.\n\nSutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference Thursday that 136 people are severely injured and more than 600 have light injuries.\n\nThe death toll \u201cprobably will increase,\u201d he says, despite the agency only counting one person as officially missing. \u201cA joint rescue team is still continuing to search for the victims.\u201d\n\n___\n\n10:15 a.m.\n\nHajj Yusri Abdullah, owner of a shop in Meureudu town\u2019s crumpled market, says he isn\u2019t holding out much hope survivors will be found as backhoes and rescuers, worked on the rubble.\n\nHe says nearly two dozen bodies were pulled from the market debris on Wednesday including a group of eight made up of a newlywed couple and family members holding an ornate celebration known as Antar Dara Baro.\n\nLocal TV reported that about 40 shop houses in the market collapsed.\n\nNearly 100 people died in the shallow and powerful quake that struck northeast Sumatra before dawn on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\n8:00 p.m.\n\nSearch and rescue efforts after Indonesia\u2019s earthquake are being hampered by power blackouts and rain, but officials hope they can continue at night to some extent.\n\nAiyub Abbas, chief of Pidie Jaya district which took the brunt of the earthquake, says efforts are focusing on locations where victims are believed to be trapped. \u201cThe search this night depends on the location and the weather conditions,\u201d he says.\n\nThe army chief in Aceh province has said the quake killed 97 people and only four have been pulled from the rubble alive.\n\nA disaster mitigation agency official says there are about 10 locations where searchers believe people are buried.\n\n___\n\n7:25 p.m.\n\nThe Indonesian Red Cross says it\u2019s mobilizing aid for earthquake survivors from Aceh\u2019s provincial capital, Banda Aceh, and the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, with an initial priority on clean water and sanitation.\n\nThe charity\u2019s head of disaster management, Arifin Hadi, says five water trucks have already been sent into areas worst hit by the quake, where it has 100 people on the ground.

They never would use the money to fix things.\u201d\n\nHowever, not everyone agreed with the criticism of\u00a0Almena. A cat owner named Nikki Kelber, 44, who lived in the \u201cGhost Ship\u201d and narrowly escaped the fire with her feline suggested to the\u00a0Times that\u00a0Almena was being unfairly blamed for the fire.\n\nAccording to\u00a0the Sacramento Bee, the death toll in Friday\u2019s fire has risen to 36 as of Monday, and could rise further still.\n\nEight victims have been identified and their names released. Among them was Draven McGill, a 17-year-old at San Francisco\u2019s\u00a0Ruth Asawa School of the Arts.\n\nThe others\u00a0identified thus far\u00a0are Cash Askew, 22, of Oakland, David Cline, 35, of Oakland, Nick Gomez-Hall, 25, of Coronado, Sara Hoda, 30, of Walnut Creek, Travis Hough, 35, of Oakland, Donna Kellogg, 32, of Oakland and Brandon Chase Wittenauer, 32, of Hayward.\n\nFollow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope\u00a0@AdelleNaz", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 17, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.55191254615784, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 662, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.7863442113, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161205230000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.32326283987915, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.0}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2017/01/25/trumps-major-investigation-voter-fraud-look-like/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a7": [3723]}}, "headline": "What Trump's 'Major Investigation into Voter Fraud' Could Look Like", "wordcount_as_scraped": 790, "date": "20170125220000", "story_content": "Partisan outrage and media curiosity swirled anew early Wednesday morning when President Trump announced on Twitter his decision to charge his administration with investigating \"voter fraud\", potentially leading to reforms made in the future.\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer was careful to note in his Wednesday briefing that any \"investigation\"\u2013regardless of the form it takes\u2013would not be limited to the recent 2016 Election and focus more broadly on issues related to outdated voter records where people had died, moved or became ineligible.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) quickly threw cold water on the announcement by castigating Trump for wanting to \"investigate something that can clearly be proven to be false,\" Roll Call reported. The former Speaker of the House added that she felt sad for the new White House occupant, noting that she \"even prayed for him\". Republican National Lawyers Association Executive Director Michael Thielen disagreed, arguing in a statement that Democrats \"deny reality\", but grants that America's decentralized system of elections and current integrity controls largely make voter fraud \"hard to catch and hard to prosecute.\"\n\nFor what may appear to be a herculean research task, there exists clear precedent for how a Trump Administration could move forward. The most direct avenue to study weaknesses in voter registration systems would be for the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department to return to its practice of enforcing Section 8 of the National Voter Registration Act against counties and states that allow their records to fall into disrepair. The federal law requires local jurisdictions to create uniform and nondiscriminatory measures that remove dead, relocated, and otherwise ineligible voters from the rolls. When research demonstrates that a state is apparently failing the task, the DOJ has the option to bring a suit to force a correction. The Bush Justice Department made multiple examples of states in this manner when jurisdictions in Missouri, Arkansas, Indiana, Maine, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania were not properly maintaining records.\n\nAs the DOJ record shows, the changeover to the Obama DOJ exhibited an abrupt halt to such activity, leaving nonprofit organizations like the Public Interest Legal Foundation and the American Civil Rights Union to bring similar cases when the feds refused. These groups found that 141 counties across the United States had more registered voters than residents aged 18 and up. Shortly before Trump's announcement, the organizations inked a settlement with one Mississippi county that would begin to clean its records after showing greater than 110 percent registration there. Without a DOJ willing to loom large over states in apparent violation, nonprofits will be slow to enforce federal laws on their own without budgets comparable to the Civil Rights Division.\n\nThe Trump Administration also has the option to empanel a commission in the mold of Carter-Baker, which in 2005 set out 87 recommendations for election reform that most notably argued photo voter identification rules should be passed either on a federal or individual state levels, according to The Washington Post. The duo also found that at the time, 46,000 New York City residents maintained dual voter registrations in various Florida counties. In response, the Commission stressed that states adopt updated standards to compare data that would better identify duplicate voter registrations.\n\nA Trump Justice Department can also revive enforcement of a criminal statute that apparently was missing from former Attorney General Eric Holder's law books: 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973i(e). Twice, the Obama DOJ declined to prosecute cases where individuals voted more than once in a single federal election despite national media coverage. A Democrat candidate for Maryland's First Congressional District, Wendy Rosen, resigned from the race after her pattern of double voting in Florida and Maryland came to light in September 2012, according to The Washington Post. The Baltimore Sun later reported a plea agreement in state court was made in 2013. Shortly after the 2012 Election, Cincinnati voter Melowese Richardson admitted to casting multiple ballots to help President Obama's re-election chances in front of a local television camera. State prosecutors brought appropriate charges while a U.S. Attorney did not. Breitbart News later reported that Ms. Richardson was labeled a hero for voting rights by the Ohio Democratic Party in 2014.\n\nWhether \"millions\" of noncitizen voters cast ballots or not in the 2016 Election will likely prove a mystery since federal and state laws do not currently require proof of citizenship when registering to vote or verification after the fact. If states follow Kansas' lead and enact such reforms, the level of uncertainty surrounding this question will likely reduce to zero in future elections.\n\nLogan Churchwell is a founding editor of the Breitbart Texas team.

Some of those headlines were a bit more cautious, such as the\u00a0Jerusalem Post\u00a0reporting that the State Department team resigned \u201cin a possibly coordinated walkout.\u201d\n\nAs it turns out, that \u201cwalkout\u201d was coordinated by the Trump administration:\n\nBreaking: Four top @StateDept Mgmt officials all fired by Trump admin, part of effort to \"clean house\" \u2013 officials tell @eliselabottcnn\n\u2014 Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) January 26, 2017\n\n\n\nFrom CNN\u2019s full story on the matter:\n\nAll four, career officers serving in positions appointed by the President, submitted letters of resignation per tradition at the beginning of a new administration.\nThe letters from the White House said that their resignations were accepted and they were thanked for their service.\nThe White House usually asks career officials in such positions to stay on for a few months until their successors are confirmed.\n\u201cAny implication that that these four people quit is wrong,\u201d one senior State Department official said. \u201cThese people are loyal to the secretary, the President and to the State Department. There is just not any attempt here to dis the President. People are not quitting and running away in disgust. This is the White House cleaning house.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese positions are political appointments, and require the President to nominate and the Senate to confirm them in these roles. They are not career appointments but of limited term,\u201d said State Department spokesman Mark Toner. \u201cOf the officers whose resignations were accepted, some will continue in the Foreign Service in other positions, and others will retire by choice or because they have exceeded the time limits of their grade in service.\u201d\n\nThe \u201centire senior management\u201d team suffering this \u201cmass\u201d obliteration consists of Assistant Secretary of State for Administration Joyce Anne Barr, Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs Michele Bond, Ambassador Gentry O. Smith of the Office of Foreign Missions, and most notably Undersecretary for Management Patrick Kennedy, who tried to drag the FBI into Hillary Clinton\u2019s cover-ups.\n\nKennedy has also been accused of playing\u00a0a role in the Benghazi disaster, although the State Department\u2019s internal review \u201cdownplayed\u201d his role in the \u201cdecision-making that led to the inadequate security posture in Benghazi,\u201d as the\u00a0Washington Examiner\u00a0recalls. The\u00a0Examiner\u00a0also notes his \u201cyou can\u2019t fire me, I quit\u201d retirement was announced yesterday, so treating it like big news today is somewhat disingenuous.\n\nThe Trump campaign said that Kennedy had to go, and called (in vain, of course) on Hillary Clinton to speak out against him, as well. This is not some shocking walkout by a defiant Resistance speaking truth to power \u2013 it is President Trump fulfilling a campaign promise on his fourth day in office.\n\nAlso, while most news reports described the four outgoing officials as holding their offices under both Republican and Democrat administrations, to promote the impression they were nonpartisan fixtures of the bureaucracy who just couldn\u2019t handle the arrival of President Trump, that is really only true of Kennedy, and he was only in position for two years\u00a0before the Obama administration began. Joyce Barr was appointed in 2011, while Michele Bond and Gentry Smith were appointed in 2015.\n\nThe Hill\u00a0reports that these four joined \u201ca number of other officials who have departed since President Trump took office last week,\u201d but goes on to cite only two names: Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security Gregory Starr, who retired, and Bureau of Overseas Building Operations Lydia Muniz.\n\nCNN notes that Starr only came out of retirement in 2012, and planned all along to retire at the end of the Obama administration, even if Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election.\n\nThe American Foreign Service Association also shot down the narrative\u00a0about mass resignations: While this appears to be a large turnover in a short period of time, a change of administration always brings personnel changes, and there is nothing unusual about rotations or retirements in the Foreign Service. Indeed, both are essential to the development of a steady stream of experienced leaders ready to assume critical roles at State.\n\n\u201cGiven the talent available in our diplomatic corps, we expect that the new Secretary will have no trouble finding the right people at State to fill out his senior leadership team,\u201d the AFSA added, referring to Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson, who still awaits a final confirmation vote.\n\nThe\u00a0New York Daily News\u00a0falsely implied Tillerson\u2019s visit to the State Department on Wednesday actually prompted the \u201cwalk-outs\u201d that didn\u2019t happen, adding another prime clipping to the day\u2019s scrapbook of Fake News.\n\nAll of these folks are entitled to their opinions, just like anyone else, and if they are profoundly displeased by the election of Donald Trump, they are free to say so. The American people are equally entitled to wonder if the State Department should have so many partisan officials, and to look back on the long record of scandals and cover-ups in the Obama State Department as justification for a vigorous house-cleaning.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.82608699798584, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 845, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.62114131819, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170126230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.72189349112426, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/11/05/african-nations-reject-appointment-un-gay-rights-envoy/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3135, 3145, 3168, 3176, 3183, 3199, 3763, 3774, 4315]}}, "headline": "African Nations Reject Appointment of UN Gay Rights Envoy", "wordcount_as_scraped": 659, "date": "20161105230000", "story_content": "A coalition of 54 African states submitted a resolution Friday calling for the suspension of the UN's new LGBT investigator, noting that gender identity and sexual orientation have no place in international human rights instruments.\n\nIn late September, the UN Human Rights Council named Professor Vitit Muntarbhorn of Thailand to the new role, charging him with investigating discrimination of LGBT persons worldwide. The African nations have challenged the legality of the appointment, asking that his mandate be put on hold.\n\nMuntarbhorn has been tasked with assessing implementations of existing international human rights law, identifying best practices and gaps, and raising awareness of violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI). Critics suggest that his very mandate will constitute interference with the laws of many UN countries.\n\nSeventy three countries worldwide, and almost 40 percent of all UN member states, have anti-sodomy laws on their books. In Africa alone, 33 states have laws making homosexual acts a crime, including Uganda, Nigeria, Sudan and Mauritania.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the African countries, Botswana's ambassador told a General Assembly human rights committee Friday that African nations \"are alarmed\" that the Human Rights Council is delving into national matters and attempting to focus on people \"on the grounds of their sexual interests and behaviors.\"\n\nAmbassador Charles Ntwaagae said that the Council had no business looking into \"sexual orientation and gender identity,\" which are notoriously absent from the United Nations charter document, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\n\"Those two notions are not and should not be linked to existing international human rights instruments,\" said Ntwaagae. The UN has never adopted an official position regarding putative rights of gender identity or sexual orientation, though it does guarantee the rights of life, liberty, security, property and equal protection to all persons without distinction.\n\n\"We therefore call for the suspension of the activities of the appointed independent expert pending the determination of this issue,\" said Ntwaagae.\n\nThe Africa group claimed that a focus on homosexual rights also takes attention away from other issues of \"paramount importance,\" such as racism and the right to development.\n\nThe draft resolution questioning the legality of Muntarbhorn's mandate will be put to a vote on Tuesday. If adopted it would then need to be voted upon later this year by the General Assembly.\n\nAfrican leaders have often complained of attempts by Western nations to impose their values on other countries, accusing them of \"cultural imperialism.\"\n\nWhen President Barack Obama visited Africa in 2015, he made the LGBT agenda one of the centerpieces of his message, comparing discrimination of gays in Africa to the treatment of blacks in America prior to the civil rights movement.\n\n\"As an African American in the United States I am painfully aware of what happens when people are treated differently under the law,\" the\u00a0president\u00a0said.\n\nAccording to an\u00a0article\u00a0in the\u00a0New York Times,\u00a0however, Obama's full-court press for homosexual rights in Africa backfired, resulting in increased hostility toward gays rather than greater acceptance.\n\nImmediately after his visit, a number of Africa's political and religious leaders lashed out at the president, requesting that he learn to respect Africa's values rather than imposing his own.\n\n\"In the same way that we don't try to impose our culture on anyone, we also expect that people should respect our culture in return,\" said Theresa Okafor, a Nigerian activist.\n\nCardinal John Onaiyekan, the Catholic\u00a0Archbishop\u00a0of Abuja Diocese in Nigeria, said that the position of Catholics against homosexual behavior is irrevocable and that the Church will continue to maintain its stand against gay marriage.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we are living in a world where these things have now become quite acceptable but for the fact that they are acceptable doesn't mean that they are right,\" he said. \"The Catholic Church considers itself as carrying the banner of the truth in the world that has allowed itself to be so badly deceived.\"\n\nFollow Thomas D.

Ambassador John Bolton, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, discussed with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow the Russian election-hacking story and the possibility that it was a \"false flag\" operation.\n\n\"A 'false flag' in intelligence parlance is an operation mounted by a foreign intelligence service where they deliberately leave clues that point to another country,\" Bolton explained. \"In other words, if you're, for example, staging a coup d'etat, you leave weapons and uniforms from a country that supports the incumbent regime, to make it look like it's just an internal battle, rather than the opponents. If it were an American-backed coup, we'd leave AK-47s, in the Cold War days, and Russian uniforms, rather than giving them M-16s and American uniforms. It's something that's intended to show that what looks obvious on the surface may not be the case.\"\n\n\"My question here, which I have not yet heard answered since this first came up over a month before the election, is why the intelligence community \u2013 which disagrees on many, many things \u2013 is so absolutely certain this is the Russians, rather than somebody else,\" he asked. \"Look, I fully believe that Vladimir Putin's Russia is capable and willing to try and disrupt America's elections. I don't have any illusions about them. But I don't see that they've established in public yet, the Obama administration, what the proof of it is.\"\n\n\"If I may just clear up one thing that some in the press deliberately obfuscated, from something I said the other day: I have never believed, never believed, that it was the Obama administration that hacked the DNC, or the RNC, or Podesta. I never said it. I think something I said was confused and distorted, so let me clear that matter up,\" Bolton said.\n\nWhen Marlow proposed that stories about him accusing the Obama administration of running a false flag operation were a prime example of \"fake news,\" Bolton quipped, \"Well, Heaven forbid the media ever engage in that! I just thought it was lazy and incompetent on their part, but you know, I'm just repeating myself. It's par for the course.\"\n\n\"The false flag I was asking about was whether it was another foreign service or someone else,\" he reiterated. \"Now, look, none of us outside the classification system can really say for certain, but I'm just asking why it was so quick in the intelligence services, before the election, not just to leak out, but to say publicly they thought it was the Russians.\" \n\n\"And so I think this is something that congressional committees should look at,\" Bolton advised. \"I think that Mike Pompeo, who I certainly hope will be confirmed as CIA director, will look at it inside the CIA. Let's get this out there because it's corrupting and politicizing the incredibly important work that all intelligence agencies do. If our people lose confidence in them because of yet another episode, under President Obama, of politicizing intelligence, it's going to do us grave harm.\"\n\nMarlow noted that current media coverage of the election-hacking story acts is completely ignorant of the history of politicized intelligence in the Obama administration, as though such skulduggery were\u00a0unheard of since 2009.\n\n\"Yeah, politicization of the intelligence agencies only takes place in Republican administrations. It never takes place under Democrats,\" Bolton said sarcastically. \"This is just another example of the hopeless bias of the mainstream media. I'm afraid \u2013 as I say because I've been, in various government jobs, an avid consumer of intelligence, and I found it incredibly important to enable me to do the various jobs that I've had. So the risk of it being politicized is a most serious risk that all Americans should be concerned about.\"\n\nMarlow pointed out that no actual evidence for the claim of Russian hacking, intended to benefit Donald Trump in the 2016 election, has yet been presented to the public, and the claims leaked to the media by some intelligence officials have been disputed by others.\n\n\"I'm not arguing that, at least in public, any information should be released or declassified that might compromise intelligence sources and methods,\" said Bolton. \"I think that's something we need to be a lot more respectful of than the Obama administration ever was. But I do think when you have senior officials in the intelligence community speaking publicly, that just simply taking what they say on faith is not good enough.\"\n\n\"We had this extraordinary development last night, reported on Fox News, that leaders of four members of the intelligence community had refused to have their surrogates appear at a hearing this morning before the House Intelligence Committee on this subject of Russian hacking,\" he noted. \"It was, I think, DNI, CIA, FBI, and perhaps one other, just refused to show up \u2013 NSA, perhaps \u2013 before Devin Nunes' committee.\" \n\n\"Maybe they're too busy preparing to brief the members of the Electoral College, as a lot of Democrats have been asking for, too,\" he speculated, with another dash of sarcasm. \"I think people should watch how that plays out because it suggests that maybe they don't entirely have their political act together. All the more reason to have them up to testify.\"\n\n\"If I may just say one other thing on that, too: I don't believe intelligence services should put their analyses through a smoothie machine so that they all agree on everything,\" Bolton added. \"I don't think members of Congress, policy makers, and the executive branch of the American public should ever be disturbed if different agencies come to different conclusions. I think they should present their evidence and their arguments to policymakers, and policymakers can then make up their mind who's made the better case.\"\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\u00a0to 9:00 a.m.\u00a0Eastern.\n\nLISTEN:\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.8155338764190696, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 931, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.9708621262400001, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 17, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161215200000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 1.82599355531686, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.54545454545}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/12/14/watch-british-muslims-gather-show-strength-demand-caliphate/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1012, 1025, 1444]}}, "headline": "WATCH: British Muslims Gather in Show of Strength to Demand Caliphate", "wordcount_as_scraped": 515, "date": "20161215150000", "story_content": "Over a thousand British Muslims took to the streets of London on Tuesday in a show of force, blocking off a central London square to call for a caliphate while the crowd chanted \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019.\n\nWe need a Caliph who will clean up these streets / Who will smack up armies and who will back beef [fighting]. / Backhand your missiles back to your land, that\u2019s the plan. / World domination at hand.

The building has lain empty since May 2012 when the Syrian ambassador to the UK was expelled by the British government.\n\nThe crowd, mostly drawn from mosques across London, was largely self-segregated with many of the women wearing Islamic clothing.\u00a0 It soon grew to block off the entire road, with many in the crowd waving what looked to be the Taliban flag, while others were handed placards made by Hizb ut-Tahrir Britain, which calls for the reestablishment of a caliphate. It is not clear who organised the demonstration.\n\nFollowing prayers, a series of speakers addressed the crowd, talking for over an hour amidst constant interruption in the form of cheers of support.\n\nAsim Qureshi, director of the Muslim rights group CAGE, which has been linked to extremism, laid the blame for the situation in Aleppo at America\u2019s door, saying: \u201cNever forget who is the problem here.\n\n\u201cWhen they say \u2018look, America is the one who is going to come and help you in this\u2019, then we have to remind them.

They\u00a0also know that we mark Easter to celebrate Jesus\u2019s death and resurrection which conquered death and gives us forgiveness for our sins. And there is so much more good news from his life and work \u2014 conquering politics, for one!\n\nWhether they voted or not, most\u00a0Americans had a deep emotional investment in this year\u2019s election \u2014 so much so that families, friendships, and even church communities were torn apart by politics.\n\nI attended a \u201cUnity Forum\u201d at my church that allowed people to vent their frustrations about the election and its aftermath. One of the very first people to speak was a woman who said that if her brothers and sisters in Christ had voted for Donald Trump, she had lost respect for them.\n\nIt got even uglier from there.\n\nI listened to the fights and tears and accusations, and I chimed in clumsily at the end of\u00a0the night with\u00a0some encouragement \u2014 which I hope to refine here, not just for my local church but for all believers.\n\nOur world is becoming increasingly tribal \u2014 us vs. them. Lobbing bombs from our camp at theirs. The hope for\u00a0E pluribus unum seems to be receding, with no innocent parties. And this year may, indeed, have proven that ideal\u00a0impossible for men to accomplish on their own.\n\nSo, do we throw our hands up and just retreat to the woods? Not at all \u2014 but we can stop worrying about the outcome of elections.\u00a0That idea, I\u2019m certain, is already popular among Trump fans \u2014 who make up many of Breitbart\u2019s\u00a0readers.\u00a0Trump supporters at my church gave many exhortations for Hillary voters to trust in God and overcome their fear.\n\nBut the flipside of that message is:\u00a0we don\u2019t have to put our hope in the outcome, either.\n\nAnd this is the easier sin. It\u2019s almost a clich\u00e9 to say, \u201cThe government is going against everything I believe, but I know that God is in control.\u201d\u00a0It is much, much harder to remember God\u2019s kingdom when we are fixated on and trusting the work of a government that we think will make life better.\n\nIn Jesus\u2019s time, some Jews expected the Messiah to be a political or military leader \u2014 a revolutionary who would overthrow the Roman empire. Yet he, as a carpenter who didn\u2019t live to 40, accomplished\u00a0so much more than that.\n\nJesus brought a new, otherworldly kingdom (John 18:36) \u2014 one that exists\u00a0today within and across the world\u2019s nations (Luke 13:29, 17:20-21) and will someday become the only authority in the world, with Jesus as both its King (Revelation 1:5) and Priest (Hebrews 4, 5). If we put our faith in a manmade nation \u2014 in our land, in our race, in a document like the Constitution, or a president \u2014 that faith will result in nothing, since all these things are not just guaranteed but prophesied to come to an end (Daniel 2, Revelation 21).\n\nSo how do we become part of this kingdom? God\u2019s word says we must be \u201cborn again\u201d \u2014 a concept that is very hard to explain since it is, in one sense, one size fits all, but radically different in the particulars for every single person.\n\nIn John chapter 3, before\u00a0the famous sixteenth verse,\u00a0Jesus discusses this new kingdom with a prominent Pharisee named Nicodemus. He reveals\u00a0two things: No one can\u00a0see\u00a0the Kingdom of God (v. 3) unless they are born again, and no one can\u00a0enter\u00a0the Kingdom of God (v. 5) unless they are born of water and the Spirit.\n\nAgain, this is a very difficult thing to explain, and I certainly can\u2019t do it in 900 words. If you want to know more about it, I urge you to ask a Christian about it \u2014 face to face, if possible. American Christians love people who ask us questions! It\u2019s much easier than broaching the subject ourselves.\n\nAs for the nations where we find ourselves today, what does the Bible say about how much we should be involved in politics? It says we are to live as foreigners and exiles (1 Peter 2:11)\u00a0within them, and we are to respect their laws and authority (Romans 13, Titus 3).\n\nOurs is a representative government, so we should be informed and involved through voting and activism, but\u00a0whatever the outcome of those efforts, our hope is in a different nation \u2014 the only lasting kingdom.\n\nThere are many causes where we can work to advance the Kingdom of God, and those will intersect with political activity. I\u2019m certainly not discouraging anyone\u2019s involvement in that. But, knowing what Jesus has accomplished, why\u00a0get so worked up about a country\u2019s affairs that we hate our neighbors, in direct contradiction of God\u2019s own commands?\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t just to scold or pretend like I have this figured out and other people don\u2019t. I need this reminder \u2014 because I,\u00a0too, judge my brothers and sisters over politics! This is a message of freedom. We are free from worry. We are freed from following\u00a0the minutiae of political schemes and conflicts, free from constant outrage, free from guilt by association, free from vengeance against those who hurt us, free from fearing those who kill the body.\n\nChrist gives us liberty from all these things, and if you feel burdened by them today, I hope and I pray your Christmas celebration overcomes them.\n\nEzra Dulis is Deputy Managing Editor for Breitbart News.

In November, 2014, for example, he declared that:\n\nSometimes we get attached to our particular tribe, our particular race, our particular religion, and then we start treating other folks differently. And that, sometimes, has been a bottleneck to how we think about immigration.\u00a0 If you look at the history of immigration in this country, each successive wave, there have been periods where the folks who were already here suddenly say, 'Well, I don't want those folks' \u2014 even though the only people who have the right to say that are some Native Americans.\n\nObama\u2019s decision to shut down the path for migrating Cubans \"is the obvious corollary of Obama's normalizing relations with Cuba,\" said Krikorian. \"This should have been part of the original [2014 U.S-Cuban] deal \u2026 but better late than never,\u201d he added.\u00a0\n\nKrikorian supports the shutdown, partly because Cuban migration has increased the supply of low-wage labor, and so reduced Americans\u2019 wages. The greatest impact was seen in 1980, when a massive movement of Cubans into Miami sharply reduced wages for unskilled Americans, including African-Americans\n\nMenendez \u2014 who worked with Obama to pass the 2013 \"Comprehensive Immigration Reform\" bill that would given work-permits to roughly 33 million foreigners in 10 years \u2014 also blamed Obama's foreign policy for the Cuban migration shutdown.\n\n\"The Obama administration seeks to pursue engagement with the Castro regime at the cost of ignoring the present state of torture and oppression, and its systematic curtailment of freedom,\" said Menendez. \n\nSome left-wing groups agree with Obama\u2019s decision to favor the Cuban dictatorship over Cuban migrants.\n\nGeoffrey Thale, at the left-wing Washington Office on Latin America, also endorsed the shutdown while also supporting greater immigration from Cuba.\u00a0\"The Obama Administration has taken a positive step toward a more sensible Cuban immigration policy, one that ends preferential treatment for Cubans compared with others who arrive without visas,\" said his statement.\n\n\nCubans have been seeking entry into the United States primarily because of economic stagnation at home. The U.S. embargo is one of many factors that has contributed to that stagnation, and so WOLA and many colleagues have recommended to the Administration that it should both end preferential treatment for Cubans and increase the number of visas available to Cubans who pursue regular immigration routes.\"\n\n\nSimilarly, an author at the American Immigration Council recently promoted a pending bill that would shut down the path. \"As our country moves closer to normalizing relations with Cuba, the calls to re-examine our Cuba policy will only continue to grow. Instead of waiting until the last minute to act, Congress should begin looking at this issue now,\" the article said.\n\nDuring Obama's terms in office, he has allowed a growing inflow of migrants from Central Americans and Cuba. \n\nSince 2012, for example, he allowed more than 350,000 migrants from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to apply for asylum. \n\nSince 2012, more than 100,000 Cubans have also claimed asylum under the 1966 anti0communist law that first set up the Cuban pathway. \n\nAccording to Pew Research Center, \u201cOverall, 43,159 Cubans entered the U.S. via ports of entry in fiscal year 2015, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data obtained through a public records request. This represents a 78% increase over the previous year, when 24,278 Cubans entered. And those 2013 numbers had already increased dramatically after the Cuban government lifted travel restrictions.

Paul Ryan (R-WI). The House Speaker says that, rather than revamping faulty U.S trade policy, the solution for America's manufacturing woes is simply to enact \"comprehensive tax reform.\"\n\nIt's a view shared by other GOP stalwarts, including Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), and the Club for Growth's David McIntosh. According to McIntosh, tariffs and trade wars would make the U.S. economy \"tank again.\" Instead, the prescription to him is obvious: \"Tax cuts and deregulation.\"\n\nHere's the problem with this predictable, longstanding GOP remedy for our trade problems: It just won't work.\n\nThe foreign trade stratagems put in place to hinder America's exports have simply grown too voluminous and complex to surmount simply by lowering the corporate tax rate and cutting regulations.\n\nChina's illegal export-boosting policies are a prime example, although Beijing is far from alone in the trade cheating category. Since its 2001 entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), China's trade surplus with the United States has climbed by $284 billion.\n\nWhy? Because Beijing has based its export-led growth on predatory practices such as currency manipulation, massive subsidies, and large-scale dumping of industrial commodities like steel. Significantly, these tactics violate Beijing's WTO and IMF commitments. But, to date, the United States simply hasn't found the political will to enact the broad array of policies needed to counter Chinese cheating.\u00a0 The occasional WTO lawsuit is hardly an adequate response.\n\nIt would be humorous, if it weren't so distressing, to hear otherwise intelligent Republicans warn of a coming trade war\u2014when the United States has already been suffering the ill effects of one-sided attacks for the past 40-plus years.\n\nCertainly, the recent toll is obvious\u2014with millions of U.S. manufacturing jobs lost to China and other competitor nations since 2001. And so it's strange that House Republicans would fear reprisal when so much damage has already been inflicted, and it is the U.S. that needs to retaliate to preserve its manufacturing base.\n\nThere is one area, however, where Republicans may finally be seeing the proverbial light, and that involves the issue of a Value Added Tax (VAT). Currently, the United States is the only major industrialized nation not to employ a VAT system. As a consequence, foreign VAT taxes not only impose a surcharge on U.S. exports to a VAT country but also subsidize that country's producers with rebates for their own exports. They do so legally under trade rules, while America has chosen to take it on the chin rather than respond.\n\nNotably, these foreign VAT systems amount to a stealth tax on American-made goods. And, when combined with the egregious currency manipulation and rampant subsidies practiced by countries including China and Japan (which also employ VATs), it builds an enormous protective wall against U.S. exports.\n\nThe challenges posed by the current, tilted VAT system seem to have finally reached even\u00a0ardent free-traders like Paul Ryan, though. The House speaker's recent Blueprint for Tax Policy, co-authored with Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX), recognizes that America's \"major trading partners raise a significant portion of their tax revenues through value-added taxes.\" The two conclude that the overseas VAT system imposes a \"unilateral penalty on U.S. exports\" while also providing a \"unilateral subsidy\" on imports.\n\nThis realization is a major step forward for Republicans: Ryan, Brady, and others finally grasp the competitive advantages bestowed by a VAT system and understand that the U.S. must counter it to be competitive in world markets.\u00a0 Specifically, their blueprint calls for a consumption-based, border-applicable tax/rebate system allowing the United States to \"counter the border adjustments that our trading partners apply in their VATs.\"\n\nCorrecting the VAT inequity won't solve all of the challenges facing U.S. exporters, but it's a significant start\u2014and one that can help to bring revenue into the federal treasury without saddling domestic businesses. Of course, there are already howls that the Republican proposal may be illegal under WTO trade rules, but these should not deter the Republicans from moving forward. Let's legislate now, then litigate later at the WTO, if necessary.\n\nRyan and his colleagues should be commended for forward thinking. The next step for the Republican Congress and President Trump is to design, pass, and sign legislation codifying the initiative. With potentially sweeping changes afoot in U.S. competitiveness policy, it's entirely possible that such a tax system could be enacted, along with other measures\u2014with penalizing currency manipulation chief among them\u2014to rebalance trade flows, advantage U.S. manufacturers, and fulfill the president-elect's promise to restore lost middle class jobs.\n\nKevin L.

That's not what Santa Fe is about.\"\n\nThe State of New Mexico has gone back and forth on its position on cooperating with immigration officials. In 1986, then-Governor Toney Anaya declared the state to be a sanctuary state, according to SanctuaryCities.info, a website that tracks such jurisdictions. That decision was reversed in 2011 by Governor Susana Martinez, a former prosecutor.\n\n\u201cI did an executive order within minutes after I was sworn into office in 2011,\u201d Gov. Susana Martinez said during a visit to Ruidoso, New Mexico in July 2015, the Ruidoso News reported. \u201cI said there will not be any sanctuary city. Our police officers will ask where someone is from, especially if they are being arrested and put in jail for crimes, because that needs to be considered by a judge. Are you a flight risk or a danger to the community and would you return to court for proceedings to determine whether you are culpable for some offense you are accused of?\"\n\nThe City of Santa Fe had previously passed a sanctuary city resolution in 1999. Knowing the City is at risk of losing federal funding, it is attempting to strengthen its position. \"This resolution puts us in a more defensible (legal) position than current sanctuary policies,\" said retired attorney Jim Harrington. Harrington has done volunteer work for\u00a0Somos un Pueblo Unido, the Albuquerque newspaper reported. Harrington told the reporter the U.S. Supreme Court has restricted how the federal government can use funding cuts to enforce policy.\n\nUnder existing law, the Department of Justice (DOJ) can already move quickly to not only cut off future law enforcement grants to the city\u2013it can recoup past grants for any period of time the municipality was not 100 percent compliant with federal immigration law, according to U.S. Representative John Culberson (R-TX).\n\nCulberson spent most of 2016 working with DOJ officials to enforce 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373, a law that passed in 1996 to require local and state jurisdictions to cooperate with immigration officials or risk losing federal funding, Breitbart Texas previously reported. \"The law requires cooperation with immigration officials 100 percent of the time,\" Culberson said in an exclusive interview with Breitbart Texas in November.\n\nThe DOJ Office of Inspector General certified the top 10 sanctuary jurisdictions last year and notified that they would not be eligible to apply for DOJ law enforcement grants for the coming year unless they change their policies. The current list of sanctuary jurisdictions to be defunded includes: the entire states of California and Connecticut; Orleans Parish in Louisiana; \u00a0New York City; Philadelphia; Cook County, Illinois; Miami-Dade County, Florida; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and Clark County, Nevada.\n\nThe grant process begins this month.\n\n\"I had to stand on their 'air hose,'\" Culberson explained referring to Congress' power to cut a federal agencies' funds. \"For those on the top-ten list, it is done.\"\n\nThe actions of the defiant Santa Fe City Council could move New Mexico's capital city onto that list as well.\n\nBob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

The reef is already home to a lighthouse, Reuters notes, but it \u201cis completely submerged at high tide.\u201d The dredging project appears designed to change this.\n\nThe Reuters report notes that, while Vietnam\u2019s government did not respond to a request for comment on the new construction, China responded with another warning against Vietnam developing its sovereign territory. China, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said, has\u00a0\u201cindisputable sovereignty over the Nansha [Spratly] islands, including Riji [Ladd] reef.\u201d \u201cWe urge the relevant countries to respect China\u2019s sovereignty and rights, end their illegal occupation and illegal operations, and not take any actions that may complicate the situation,\u201d he added.\n\nChina claims most of the South China Sea, including the territories of Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines, Brunei, and Malaysia, as well as waters off the coast of Indonesia\u2019s Natuna Island. In July, the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague found China\u2019s claims in the region invalid, and its massive island-building projects in the Spratly and Paracel Islands illegal. China responded by vowing to ignore the Hague completely.\n\nThat case,\u00a0Philippines v. China, was the product of the foreign policy of former Philippine President Benigno Aquino. His successor, Rodrigo Duterte, has actively rejected the fight to protect the sovereignty of his country in the South China Sea, instead calling Chinese President Xi Jinping a \u201cclose friend\u201d and temporarily banning Philippine fishermen from using the nation\u2019s sovereign waters at China\u2019s behest (China later lifted its restriction on Philippine fishing in the region).\n\nIn light of Manila\u2019s pivot, Vietnam has emerged as the most formidable challenger to China\u2019s colonization of the region. While both nations are run by their respecting Communist Parties, Vietnam has made clear it will continue to exercise its sovereignty over the territory China claims as its own. In August, shortly after reports of Chinese hackers placing pro-China South China Sea messages on Vietnam\u2019s airport screens, satellite evidence revealed that Vietnam had moved rocket launchers into the disputed territory.\n\nChina has responded to the growing resistance to its presence in Vietnamese waters by issuing false statements that\u00a0Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc supports their military projects in the South China Sea. Vietnamese officials denied China\u2019s claims.\n\nIn November, the\u00a0Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) published satellite images\u00a0showing the expansion of Vietnamese runways in the region, which would now allow the Vietnamese air force to employ more of its capabilities against any potential Chinese threat.\u00a0\"These new facilities can easily accommodate the Vietnamese air force's PZL M28B maritime surveillance aircraft and CASA C-295 transport planes,\u201d CSIS reported at the time.

Rees Shapiro\u00a0declaring\u00a0that our latest Ohio State University jihadi, Abdul Razak Ali Artan, \"stunned the community\" with his \"terrorist-style attack, again highlighting festering tensions about Islam and Muslim immigrants in U.S. society.\"\n\nTerrorist-style? He pulled off exactly the kind of attack the Islamic State has been encouraging, taking its inspiration from the Palestinian \"knife intifada\" and the truck massacre in Nice, France, but it's only \"terrorist-style,\" not bona fide terrorism? \u00a0And would it be unforgivably bold to suggest those \"tensions\" would stop \"festering\" if we had fewer jihad enthusiasts attempting to rack up jihadi points?\n\nThe Post\u2019s crack team of Mr. Magoo reporters\u00a0\u2014 Shapiro, plus Abigail Hauslohner, Susan Svrluga and Matt Zapotosky \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u00a0next inform us that FBI officials on Wednesday said \"they believe Artan's attack was inspired by the Islamic State and the radical Al Qaeda [U.S. born] Anwar al-Awlaki, [propagandist] fueling concerns about self-radicalized terrorists and the almost impossible task of detecting and preventing such attacks on U.S. soil.\"\n\nBut he wasn't exactly \"self-radicalized\" if Anwar al-Awlaki helped radicalize him, was he?\n\nThis \u201cself-radicalized\u201d shtick is the media narrative that Breitbart News National Security Editor Dr. Sebastian Gorka and former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton complained about in recent Breitbart News Daily interviews: jihadism as a kind of computer virus, contracted by otherwise normal people who stumble across the wrong web pages, and become accidentally infected. \n\nBolton sarcastically compared the supposed accidental-radicalization process to spontaneous human combustion, which supposedly killed the rock band\u2019s drummer in the satirical movie, Spinal Tap.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBut there\u2019s a rational reason for this Spinal Tap shtick: If progressives pretend radicalization occurs instantly and accidentally, progressives absolve themselves of the need to study the radicalization process seriously and honestly. That unwanted study would be problematic because it would show that some religions do good and some religions cause harm, and that reality would embarrass progressives as they ally with imported Islamists against the Christian political voters that reluctantly ally with the GOP.\n\nArtan seems to have convinced most people he met during his time at OSU that he was quiet and soft-spoken, but we still need to know a lot more about his background before asserting, or implying, that he was a good kid who went nuts because he tripped over an al-Awlaki DVD a few months ago.\n\nHis Facebook page included a photo of him giving the one-finger ISIS salute, whose significance was missed by those who work diligently to not study what the Islamic State actually says to its recruits. It's interesting how almost all media outlets ignore this photo and use the one of Artan sitting on a bench and looking thoughtful. (You can catch a glimpse of the ISIS-salute picture in this NBC News post, but even there, it's been cropped to make it hard to see what he's doing.)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reporters are also entirely willing to broadcast claims by local Muslims that they never met the guy, didn\u2019t know anything about him and gee whiz, never discussed Islam\u2019s aggressive commandments with their Facebook-using, finger-wagging neighbor infected by Sudden Jihad Syndrome.\u00a0\n\nHorsed Noah, executive director of the\u00a0Abubakar Assidiq Islamic Center in west Columbus \u2026 \u00a0learned that not only was Artan a Muslim but also among the mosque's 2,000 congregants from the area's Somali community. \"That shocked everyone,\" Noah said, noting that he did not know Artan, whose family lived a half-mile from the mosque \u2026\nAs co-presidents of the Muslim Student Association, Ohio State seniors Maliha Masood and Nabeel Alauddin also expressed fears of a possible backlash against the Islamic community \u2026\u00a0Artan was not a member of the MSA, Alauddin said, and none of the student leaders knew him.\u00a0\n\nThe Post\u2019s experts even regurgitated the Islamic groups\u2019 standard get-out-of-responsibility card \u2014 a truncated segment of text from the Koran, found at 5:32:\u00a0\n\nKader is a volunteer with one outreach program called \"Ask a Muslim,\" regularly meeting with curious members of the community to discuss Islam. He hands out pamphlets with a verse from the Koran reading \"whoever kills an innocent human being it shall be as if he has killed all mankind,\" and headlined with a simple message: \"Islam is not a religion of extremism.\"\n\nBut even a quick review of that text shows that it is not commandment for peace, but Allah\u2019s personal gangland-style threat against Jews:\u00a0\n\nBecause of that, We decreed upon the Children of Israel that whoever kills a [Muslim] soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land \u2013 it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one \u2013 it is as if he had saved mankind entirely \u2026 [5:33]\u00a0Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive upon earth [to cause] corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land.\n\nThe media also seems remarkably incurious about the presence of a mosque near Ohio State, the Masjid Omar Ibn El Khattab mosque, that was linked to an al-Qaeda cell with over a dozen members. It hasn't been determined if Artan attended services there, but it seems like the sort of detail the press would speculate about if almost any other \"hate group\" was involved in an act of violence. (Who can forget ABC News' Brian Ross promptly searching the local Tea Party rolls for anyone with the same name as the Colorado movie shooter?)\n\nEven after attempting several murders with a car and knife, Artan is still framed by the Washington Post as the victim of unreasoning hatred, not an agent of it. The Washington Post quotes Ohio State junior Kevin Stankiewicz calling him a \"thoughtful, engaged guy, a Muslim immigrant who wanted to spread understanding and awareness while expressing muted fears that U.S. society was becoming insular and fostering unfair stereotypes of his people.\"\n\nKnife jihad rampages are a poor choice for dispelling \"unfair stereotypes\" of violence.\n\nThe media is usually willing to indulge Muslims\u2019 claims that each attack is someone else\u2019s fault. So a self-described friend of Artan's named Ameer Kader told the Washington Post he was \"suspicious about official accounts of the attack that correlate Artan's motivation for the assault with his religious views,\" complaining that \"they always label Muslims and terrorists together,\" which is \"unfair and a problem.\"\n\nArtan himself has been widely quoted from an August school newspaper interview, where he said, \"If people look at me, a Muslim praying, I don't know what they're going to think, what's going to happen.\"\n\nHe then accused the media of putting a \"picture\" of Muslims in people's heads that makes them \"feel uncomfortable,\" and said he was \"kind of scared right now.\" Probably not as scared as the young woman he ran at with a knife after declaring \"I'm going to kill you,\" and bellowing a \"war cry\" the media has still not seen fit to render for us.\n\nMost of the mainstream media has, in fact, labored mightily to avoid giving any impression of Muslims other than peace-loving citizens whose religion absolutely forbids violence against the innocent. As with coverage of Artan himself, media and government bend over backwards to assure us that Islam has nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.\n\nIf you want to see what an actual media witch hunt against innocent religious people looks like, check out what liberals are currently doing to Chip and Joanna Gaines of HGTV. Coverage of Islam is 180 degrees the opposite of that. (In fact, the odds of anyone cooking up a hit piece on the gay marriage views of a mosque are near-zero, even when the imam has a close personal relationship with an individual who has actual government power.)\n\nNothing good has ever come from requiring people to believe something that contradicts the evidence of their eyes and ears. The amount of jihadi violence perpetrated and thwarted in the United States since 9/11 is not a figment of their imaginations.\n\nThe Washington Post article on the aftermath at OSU is dangerously close to the grim jest about \"Muslims Fear Backlash From Tomorrow's Terrorist Attack\" headlines. People are legitimately concerned that the media, and government, could endanger their lives by withholding vital information about terror threats to keep the \"Religion of Peace\" narrative alive. If there really is an unfair perception problem, the media made it worse by overcompensating for it.\n\nFor instance, how many media outlets have reported the full text of the Facebook post Artan put up before launching his attack? Jake Tapper of CNN is one of the very few who did:\n\nLaw enforcement official tells @ShimonPro this is text from a Facebook post believed to be by suspect in OSU attack pic.twitter.com/31S6MPjNTu\n\u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) November 29, 2016\n\n\n\nThere's an awful lot of coherent Islam in that post, complete with orthodox exhortations for Muslims to ignore prominent Muslims who disagree with al-Qaeda and ISIS\u2019s formalistic theology. Artan seems to have done a lot of Koranic research for a young man who supposedly \"self-radicalized\" overnight. If the Washington Post\u2019s team is doing a follow up, it might ask local Islamic clerics to show that their deity does not make jihad to protect other Muslims against the United States a personal obligation \u2014\u00a0fard ayn \u2014\u00a0for individual Muslims. [Rule 1 for these interviews; ask for the precise Koranic verses. Rule 2: If the Imam quotes 5:32, he\u2019s hiding something.]\n\nThe media\u2019s unwillingness to treat seriously the jihad problem is self-serving, cowardly and destructive \u2014 because it feeds the Muslim hardliners\u2019 narrative that all of their problems are caused by others \u2014 hint, hint, it\u2019s not the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, see here \u2014 and the cure to their problems is to follow the pitiless dictates of Allah\u2019s seventh-century rulebook.\n\nWhile we're searching for liberal accomplices in his radicalization, we should ask some hard questions about the culture of campus grievance. It turns out that Artan was taking a ridiculous class called \"Crossing Identity Boundaries\" that effectively required students to become angry social activists in order to score a passing grade.\n\nAs a post at Reason revealed on Thursday, Artan was working on an assignment to \"find a dozen examples of microaggressions on social media and explain which identity groups were the victims\" at the time of his death. It would have accounted for 15% of his grade.\n\nNourishing a young man's sense of grievance, alienation, and persecution in this way makes him far more vulnerable to the siren song of ISIS, and other radical groups in the case of non-Muslims. So Abdul Razak Ali Artan didn't \"self-radicalize.\" He was taking courses on how to be a good little radical from Ohio State University, the establishment media and American\u2019s most famous example of vibrant Muslim diversity, Anwar al-Awlaki.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 23, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.65085792541504, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 1, "wordcount": 1754, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 24, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 8.25522624345, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 1, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 9, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 4, "mft_max": 24, "mft_sum": 75, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 3, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161205060000, "FairnessVice": 4, "pct_mft_words": 4.27594070695553, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 6.818181818180001}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/jerusalem/2016/11/01/protests-moroccan-fishmongers-death-echo-arab-spring-trigger/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Protests Over Moroccan Fishmonger's Death Echo Arab Spring Trigger", "wordcount_as_scraped": 623, "date": "20161101110000", "story_content": "(AFP) \u2013 The gruesome death of a fishmonger in Morocco last week has triggered the country's largest protests in years, stirring memories of the death of a Tunisian vendor in 2010 which is often regarded as the spark that set the Arab Spring in motion.\n\nThousands of Moroccans took to the streets in a northern city on Monday protesting for the fourth day over the death on Friday of Mouhcine Fikri, who was crushed in a garbage truck after a confrontation with police who confiscated his produce.\n\nFikri's death in the Rif \u2014 an ethnically Berber region long neglected under the former king and at the heart of a 2011 protest movement for reform \u2014 has triggered outrage in other cities, including the capital Rabat.\n\nThousands attended his funeral in Al-Hoceima on Sunday after an image of his inert body \u2014 head and arm sticking out from under the lorry\u2019s crushing mechanism \u2014 went viral on social media.\n\nThe gruesome picture was splashed across the front page of newspapers on Monday alongside photos of the protests \u2014 in Al-Hoceima as well as in smaller Rif towns, but also in Casablanca, Marrakesh and Rabat.\n\n\u201cMorocco is in shock. The horrific death of the fish seller has caused tears in the Rif and outrage among Moroccans,\u201d the daily Akhbar Alyoum said.\n\nLarge-scale protests are rare in Morocco, where the king still holds ultimate sway. Five years ago the authorities calmed Arab Spring-style protests in 2011 with reforms, spending and tougher security while leaders in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya were swept from power.\n\nBut in recent days, a frenzy of angry postings on social media and protest chants have blamed the Makhzen, a term used to describe the royal establishment.\n\n\u201cProtests will continue until all the responsible for that crime are punished,\u201d said Al-Houssine Lmrabet, one of the protests organizers. \u201cWe also want guarantees that this will not happen again.

I wasn\u2019t an extremist back then, was I?\n\nAnd before I trotted into the Sky studios for Murnaghan during my leadership bid, the organisation\u2019s own (dreadful) reporter Beth Rigby stopped me in the make-up room to beg me for information about the UKIP leadership race.

But more interestingly, you can see how the establishment is attempting, scrambling even, to close ranks on news organisations like Breitbart.\n\nIn the past few days, blog-sites like the Indy100, tied to the Independent website, published a list of \u201cfake news\u201d sites. Breitbart was one of them. Which is bizarre when the Independent issues more corrections and apologies per year than Breitbart ever has. They had to add a right-of-reply on an article they wrote about me a few weeks ago, and indeed asked me to write an op-ed for their paper as recently as late October (I never did).\n\nAnd it seems the phrase \u201cfar right\u201d, which has floated around for some time \u2014 pushed by George Soros-funded groups like Hope not Hate and the Southern Poverty Law Center \u2014 is not strong enough anymore. Apparently, now, I am an ultra!\n\nAgain, news to me. And if Beth Rigby had any interest in being a real journalist she would have been on the front lines with me at the \u201cCrush Trump\u201d rally in New York which was organised by self-professed hard-left \u201cultras\u201d \u2014 fans of the New York Cosmos football team \u2014 who were being stirred up by a hard-left, UK-based \u201cAnti-Fa\u201d activist and marketing man.\n\nWhen I was first interviewed by Dermot Murnaghan, he declared immediately afterwards: \u201cI really enjoyed that!\u201d\n\nAgain, fast-forward a few weeks and the veteran Sky News presenter humiliated himself by pursuing a bizarre line of questioning against me down the line from Washington, D.C. My crime? Not being able to find a crisp, Royal British Legion poppy in Midtown Manhattan to sport during my meeting with President-elect Donald J. Trump.\n\nAnd today the Times declares Breitbart to be an \u201cextremist\u201d website.\n\nWas I an extremist when their reporter Billy Kenber\u00a0was\u00a0harassing my family while I ran for UKIP leader?\n\nWas I an extremist when their correspondents bumped into me on the street in Westminster and asked to take me to lunch to talk about the future of UKIP?\n\nAnd was I an extremist when one of their reporters \u2014 probably their only decent one to be honest \u2014 interviewed me over four pints of beer outside the Westminster Arms for three hours? Or when their Sunday equivalent did the same just a few days later, bringing along their photographer to snap pics of me with my favourite ale? Doesn\u2019t sound very extreme, does it?\n\nAnd it would appear their readers aren\u2019t fooled either.\n\nRemember, the Times is behind a paywall so people writing comments have already somewhat endorsed the paper\u2019s credibility with their wallets. But even they aren\u2019t convinced. Under the latest hit-piece, comments include:\n\n\u201cIs calling a news outlet \u201cracist, anti-Semitic and misogynist\u201d a way of trying to stop us reading it?

It marked his most significant victory since an uprising against his family\u2019s four-decade rule began in 2011.\n\nThe announcement was made via an army statement broadcast on Syrian state TV shortly after the last four buses carrying fighters left through the Ramousseh crossing.\n\n\u201cThanks to the blood of our heroic martyrs, the heroic deeds and sacrifices of our armed forces and the allied forces, and the steadfastness of our people, the General Command of the Army and the Armed Forces announces the return of security and stability to Aleppo,\u201d an army general said in the statement.\n\nWestern Aleppo erupted in heavy celebratory gunfire, with Syrian TV showing uniformed soldiers and civilians shouting \u201cAleppo, Aleppo!\u201d and \u201cGod, Syria and Bashar only!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo more east and west, Aleppo is back for all Aleppans,\u201d said the Syrian TV correspondent, surrounded by people waving Syrian flags.\n\nFor Syria\u2019s opposition, it was a crushing defeat that signaled the start of a new struggle to forge a way forward.\n\nAhmad al-Khatib, an opposition media activist who left the city before the siege, said the fall of Aleppo was a date \u201cwe\u2019ll never forget and we will never forgive.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet the world bear witness that Bashar Assad has killed and displaced and destroyed Aleppo, and he celebrates in his victory over the blood and offspring of Aleppo \u2026 with the agreement of the Arab and Western nations,\u201d he posted on Twitter.\n\nThe ancient city had been divided into rebel and government parts since 2012, when rebels from the countryside swept in and took hold of eastern districts. That set the stage for more than four years of brutal fighting and government bombardment that laid waste to those neighborhoods.\n\nThe army statement said the victory in Aleppo is a \u201cstrategic transformation and a turning point in the war on terrorism and a deadly blow to the terrorist project and its supporters.\u201d\n\nIt was a further incentive to keep fighting to \u201ceradicate terrorism and restore security and stability to every span of the homeland,\u201d it added.\n\nEarlier in the day, Assad said his forces\u2019 achievements in Aleppo are a \u201cmajor step on the road to wiping out terrorism\u201d and ending the civil war.\n\nThe rebel evacuations were set in motion after a months-long siege and Russian-backed military campaign. Years of resistance were stamped out in a relentless campaign over the past month that saw hospitals bombed, bodies left unburied and civilians killed by shells as they fled for safety.\n\nThe campaign targeted all remaining hospitals, knocking them out of service. Medical and food supplies ran out and fighters were left demoralized and abandoned by their regional allies.\n\nUnder a deal brokered by Russia and Turkey, tens of thousands of residents and fighters began evacuating to opposition-controlled areas in the surrounding countryside, a process that took a week.\n\nMore than 35,000 fighters and civilians were bused out, according to the United Nations. The ICRC said in a statement that more than 4,000 additional fighters were evacuated in private cars, vans and trucks since Wednesday.\n\nThe departure of the last convoy Thursday was a humiliating defeat for the opposition.\n\nThe rebels\u2019 hold in Aleppo was a major point of pride, and at times the city seemed to be an invulnerable part of what was once a growing opposition-held patch of territory in the north.\n\nThe divided northern city has paid dearly as a central theater of the war. In the past month alone, hundreds of civilians were killed by intense bombardment of rebel-held zones.\n\nA photo of 5-year-old Omran Daqneesh \u2014 confused and covered in dust and blood as he sat in an ambulance after being rescued in August from the rubble of a building \u2014 became a haunting image in the unforgiving struggle.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Philip Issa and Bassem Mroue in Beirut contributed reporting.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 5, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.83870983123779, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 659, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 19, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 5.29306422837, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 19, "mft_sum": 41, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161223030000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 6.22154779969651, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.72727272727}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/12/23/fake-news-4-websites-that-rushed-to-blame-trump-supporter-for-mississippi-church-arson/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [783, 1123, 1373, 1667, 1778, 1874, 2495, 3125]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 804, "scraper_regex": 550}}, "headline": "FAKE NEWS: 4 Websites That Rushed to Blame Trump Supporters for Mississippi Church Arson", "wordcount_as_scraped": 550, "date": "20161224010000", "story_content": "Following the November arson attack against a black church in Mississippi, several mainstream media outlets attempted to paint the crime as a racially-motivated attack by a Donald Trump supporter.\n\nDespite lacking a large amount of evidence for their claims, which were largely based on \u201cVote Trump\u201d grafitti painted onto to the church and the n-word found shortly before, the outlets continuously pushed the narrative of a Trump-induced hate crime.\n\nLittle did they know that the attack was actually allegedly perpetrated by Andrew McClinton, a black man who was a member of the church he torched.

Those charges collapsed\u00a0after Jewish leaders and Breitbart employees described Bannon as staunchly pro-Israel and a fighter of anti-Semitism, with the ADL itself conceding on Thursday that it is \"not aware of any anti-Semitic statements made by Bannon himself.\"\n\nBannon, Breitbart's former executive chairman, was named by President-elect Donald Trump\u00a0last week as chief strategist of\u00a0the new White House administration.\n\nGreenblatt in November 2014 was appointed head of the ADL, coming straight from the Obama administration, where he served as Director of the White House Office of Social Innovation and Civic Participation.\n\nGreenblatt's official ADL bio\u00a0shows\u00a0little documented experience in combating anti-Semitism.\n\nGreenblatt was an ADL intern while a graduate student at Tufts University, but the Forward newspaper reported\u00a0that his \"professional life took him to other directions.\"\n\nContinued the paper:\n\nHe managed real estate and later co-founded a socially conscience business venture, Ethos Brands, which sold bottled water while donating part of the profits to clean water programs. The company was later sold to Starbucks and Greenblatt became a vice president of the giant coffee shop conglomerate. He later served as head of GOOD media company and founded the not-for-profit All for Good, an Internet platform connecting volunteers with organizations seeking help. Greenblatt also taught social entrepreneurship at UCLA.\n\nSoros ties\n\nUntil his appointment as head of\u00a0Obama's Office of Social Innovation and Civic Participation, Greenblatt served as Director of the Impact Economy Initiative at the George Soros-funded Aspen Institute.\n\nCuriously, that role is not mentioned in Greenblatt's ADL bio, which simply states that he is \"a member of the 2006 class of Henry Crown Fellows at the Aspen Institute.\"\u00a0 The Fellowship describes itself as seeking to \"develop the next generation of community-spirited leaders, providing them with the tools necessary to meet the challenges of business and civic leadership in the 21st century.\"\n\nBesides funding from Soros, Aspen has hosted Soros on numerous occasions, including one reportedly clandestine summit aimed at devising\u00a0a strategy to defeat George W. Bush in the 2004 election.\n\nThe Aspen Institute's official mission statement is nondescript. It says the organization seeks to:\n\nSpark intellectual inquiry and exchange, connecting new concepts to timeless values.\nCreate a diverse worldwide community of leaders committed to the greater good.\nProvide a nonpartisan forum for reaching solutions on vital public policy issues.\n\nLike Aspen's generalized mission statement, Greenblatt described what he meant by \"Impact Economy,\" the namesake of the Aspen division that he directed, in general terms. He stated in a 2011 interview that \"Impact Economy\" focuses on \"national competitiveness, social impact and environmental benefit\u2026 a phenomenon that encompasses a wide range of sectors including community enterprises and clean tech as well as new fields such as affordable living and ethical brands.\u201d\n\nDiscover the Networks reports on Aspen's mission thusly:\n\nEncompassing a broad range of issues, many of AI\u2019s policy-work programs are rooted in the belief that the United States is a nation whose history amounts largely to an unbroken narrative of injustice; that government intervention frequently represents the best remedy for social and economic problems; and that America\u2019s deep-seated \"structural racism,\" while \"harder to see than its previous incarnations,\" is just as likely as its forerunner to \"perpetuate racial group inequity.\"\n\nIndeed, the term \"structural racism\" is a major theme on Aspen's website.\u00a0And it has been the theme of numerous Aspen publications and events. A closer look may help explain Greenblatt's institutional background at Aspen as it relates to his perspective on issues of racism.\n\nAspen defines \"structural racism,\" which it contends continues to impact the U.S., as:\n\nA system in which public policies, institutional practices, cultural\u00a0representations, and other norms work in various, often reinforcing ways to perpetuate\u00a0racial group inequity. It identifies dimensions of our history and culture that have allowed\u00a0privileges associated with \"whiteness\" and disadvantages associated with \"color\" to endure and\u00a0adapt over time. Structural racism is not something that a few people or institutions choose to practice. Instead it has been a feature of the social, economic and political systems in which we all\u00a0exist.\n\nAn Aspen blog post regarding the Institute's \"Roundtable on Community Change\" contends:\n\nFrom both historical and contemporary standpoints, whites have possessed advantages in all of the principal opportunity domains for a long time, including education, employment, housing, health care, political representation, and media influence. It has accumulated into an understanding among whites (and perhaps others) that \"whiteness is the 'default setting' for race in America\" and that it is the \"assumed color\" of our nation.\n\nAspen's roundtable suggested the use of a \"structural racism lens\" to understand the following concepts:\n\nThe racial legacy of our past.\nHow racism persists in our national policies, institutional practices, and cultural representations.\nHow racism is transmitted and either amplified or mitigated through public, private, and community institutions.\nHow individuals internalize and respond to racialized structures.\n\nThe roundtable concluded it is \"important to challenge the American ideals of equal opportunity and meritocracy by considering the following\":\n\nThe notion of the \"fairness of the system.\"\nConsider where we, as individuals, fit into and help sustain structural racism, especially in the media and popular culture.\nReflect on the role that social service, community development, or philanthropic organizations play in the maintenance of racial inequity.\n\nSoros's Open Society Foundations has provided numerous grants to the Aspen Institute totaling at least $515,000.\n\nIn August 2004, Soros reportedly attended \"a clandestine summit meeting\" that \"took place at the Aspen Institute, in Colorado's Rocky Mountains. The participants, all Democrats, were sworn to secrecy\" and, according to the New Yorker, included Soros and four other billionaires who \"shared a common goal: to use their fortunes to engineer the defeat of President George W. Bush in the 2004 election.\"\n\nIn 2006, National Review Online reported:\n\nSoros, through his Open Society Institute, provides support for the Aspen Institute, which runs various activities in support of its stated mission of \"foster[ing] enlightened leadership and open-minded dialogue.\" Among these activities are its \"Justice and Society Seminars,\" which often have federal judges as participants. The Aspen Institute has waived the steep seminar fee (currently up to $6,950) for participating federal judges, and also has covered their expenses for travel, lodging, and meals.\n\nSoros himself spoke at a July 2004 Aspen event titled \"America's Role in the Fight Against Global Poverty.\"\n\nIn August 2006, Aspen hosted Soros again for a speech about his book released that year, titled, The Age of Fallibility: Consequences of the War on Terror.\n\nJim Spiegelman, Aspen's director of communications, formerly served as \"special assistant\" to Soros, Spiegelman's Aspen bio notes.\n\nSoros-funded J Street\n\nGreenblatt, meanwhile, stirred controversy for remarks he made about Israel at a speech earlier this year to J Street, the Soros-financed liberal Middle East activist organization.\n\nJ Street has been critical of Israeli anti-terror operations, considers Israeli settlements an \u201cobstacle to peace,\u201d and strongly supported the Iran nuclear deal labeled by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a threat to Israel's very survival.\n\nThe pro-Israel Zionist Organization of America compiled some of Greenblatt's most controversial statements at the J Street speech alongside ZOA's \"concerns\u201d about those statements.\n\nZOA says Greenblatt \"wrongly blamed 'both sides' for acts that are the sole responsibility of Palestinian Arabs and their leaders.\"\n\nThis was a response to Greenblatt\u2019s statements:\u00a0\"We must be on guard for those\u2026 who place blame on one side instead of putting forward solutions that acknowledge the role and responsibility of both sides\" and \"both sides need more investment and less intifada, more business and less boycott, more help and less hate.\"\n\nZOA contended that Greenblatt \"falsely accused fellow Jews of 'Islamophobia' and 'marginalizing Palestinians' and claimed that the 'Palestinian narrative' is 'legitimate.'\"\n\nGreenblatt stated at the J Street dinner: \"We should not stand idly by when those in our community exhibit Islamophobia or deny the rights of the marginalized, Palestinian or otherwise. So, when it comes to striving for a two state solution, it's critical for two parties to meet halfway.\u00a0 Both sides need to acknowledge the legitimacy of the other's narrative.\u00a0 We need equal pressure for equality.\"\n\nThe ZOA noted that the \"Palestinian narrative\" consists of the \"false claim that Jews living on Jewish land are 'occupiers' that 'stole' their own land from 'Palestinian' Arabs.\u00a0 The 'Palestinian narrative' also falsely claims that Jerusalem and the Temple Mount are Islamic holy places that Jews are 'defiling,' and that Jews have no connection to Jerusalem.\"\n\nThe ZOA argued Greenblatt \"falsely implied that Israel does not protect Arab citizens' rights today, and instead portrayed protecting Arab citizens\u2019 rights as a future aspiration for which activists must fight.\"\n\nGreenblatt stated: \"We want to see Israel as a democratic country that acknowledges\u00a0[sic] and protects\u00a0[sic] the rights of all its citizens, Ashkenazi and Sephardic, Sabra and immigrant, Jew and Arab.\"\n\nThe ZOA further protested:\n\nIsrael in fact already protects the rights of all its citizens, including its Arab citizens.\u00a0 Israeli Arabs vote in Israeli elections; serve as doctors, lawyers and top judges in Israel; and even sit as members of the Israeli Knesset, despite supporting Israel's enemies. Israeli Arab MK's have visited and comforted families of Arab terrorists who murdered Jews,\u00a0joined the IHH flotilla to break the Israeli blockade of arms shipments to Hamas,\u00a0urged Islamist terrorist group Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah to fight Israel, and supported the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers.\n\nThe ZOA wrote that Greenblatt \"encouraged criticism of Israel as to why there is no \u2018two\u2013state solution\u2019\" whole ignoring that the Palestinians rejected offers of a state in 1937, 1947, 2000, and 2008, and have refused to even come to the bargaining table in recent\u00a0years.\n\nThe ZOA was referring to\u00a0Greenblatt's statement: \"Looking back [after the hopes of Oslo], some disagree about what happened or how we get to that two-state solution. We can \u2013 and should \u2013 have a robust debate. We can criticize and argue with our brothers and sisters in Israel, and with their government. I know I do. I know ADL does.\" Greenblatt also said: \"We can seek to support Palestinian self-determination.\"\n\nJerusalem Post columnist and veteran international Jewish leader Isi Leibler protested not only Greenblatt's statements on Israel, but the ADL chief's attendance at a J Street event, which Leibler feared would provide legitimacy to the controversial organization.\n\nThe negative impact of Greenblatt's overtures to J Street should not be underestimated. This is a crucial period in Israel-US relations. For one of the wealthiest Jewish establishment bodies to shower praise on an organization with a consistent track record of undermining and demonizing Israel and to call for its inclusion in the \"big tent\" will surely serve to encourage Obama to exert pressure against Israel in the last months of his tenure.\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

It calls for \u201ca bi-partisan effort in Congress to enact comprehensive immigration reform and provide these DREAMers, along with other undocumented immigrants, a path to citizenship.\u201d\n\nAccording to the El Paso Times, the resolution passed on December 20, the school board\u2019s last meeting before the district closed for winter break. Said President Dori Fenenbock: \u201cNo one understands this issue more than a community like El Paso here on the border.\u201d She called the resolution \u201can important opportunity for us to lead out.\u201d\n\nTrustee Susie Byrd said\u00a0the resolution was necessary because El Paso had a history where border agents patrolled near the district's Bowie High, pulling over teachers and students outside a campus that sits across from the U.S.-Mexico border. She also said: \"Because of the Trump message\u2026\u201d noted the Times.\n\nBorder Network for Human Rights Policy Director Robert Heyman applauded\u00a0the resolution. He estimated tens of thousands of illegal immigrants live in El Paso and called the board \u201ctorchbearers.\u201d\n\n\"When we've seen a great deal of nativism and xenophobia and racism around the country, I think it's vitally important that institutions such as school boards and local governments reaffirm that we as a community are welcoming, inclusive and we're working to advance the best interests of all the people who live here, work here and go to school here,\" Heyman told the board, the El Paso Times reported.\n\nSchool district general legal counsel Jeanne Cezanne \u201cCezy\u201d Collins emphasized, though, the resolution was a \u201cphilosophical statement\u201d of the board and not an order for district officials to take action.\n\nIt is not clear if other Texas public schools have declared sanctuary district status. Austin ISD floated a similar resolution, KEYE reported\u00a0in June although it seems to have\u00a0stalled. El Paso ISD trustee Trent Hatch suggested they partner with other Texas border districts but the\u00a0El Paso Times\u00a0indicated neighboring Ysleta and Socorro school district representatives said they had not even broached the topic of \u201csanctuary\u201d resolutions.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in the same situation as we are,\u201d he said: \u201cIf we\u2019re going to lead, let\u2019s lead. But let\u2019s don\u2019t stick our neck out if the state of Texas is not going to agree with it.\u201d\n\nIn Texas, mainly colleges declared themselves \u201csanctuary campuses\u201d including the University of Texas at Austin, Texas State University at San Marcos, University of North Texas, and Texas Women\u2019s University. The border-based University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV)\u00a0demanded \"sanctuary\" status although President Guy Bailey disagreed, pointing out that neither the state nor feds \"give us any indication that there was an interest in deporting these students or harming them.\"\n\nRecently, Governor Greg Abbott threatened to cut state funding in response to public state colleges pushing sanctuary campus agendas.\u00a0Last year, he\u00a0signed\u00a0into law the toughest border security bill of any U.S. state. Abbott\u00a0since\u00a0called for the end of sanctuary cities, saying they will \"no longer be tolerated in Texas.\"\n\nOther states\u00a0have sanctuary school districts. In February, the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD)\u00a0voted to ban Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from setting foot on any of their campuses without district permission. Following the Trump presidential win, and in response to widespread student walkouts on four consecutive school days, the LAUSD\u2019s board passed another sanctuary resolution as a\u00a0show of support to safeguard student data and protect, students, family members, or school employees who may be \u201cadversely affected by any future policies or executive action\u00a0that results in the collection of any personally identifiable information,\u201d\u00a0KPCC reported.\n\nPortland\u2019s public school board passed a similar resolution in November. It limited access to school records and classrooms,\u00a0according to the Oregonian. In December,\u00a0Santa Fe Public Schools became New Mexico\u2019s first sanctuary school district.\n\nDespite fears,\u00a0the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) prohibits schools from turning over student immigration status to federal agents. Additionally, Breitbart Texas reported\u00a0on the\u00a01982 U.S. Supreme Court ruling\u00a0Plyler v. Doe, which protects K-12 illegal immigrant minors from discrimination and requires public schools to educate these students.\n\nFollow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on\u00a0Twitter.\n\nEl Paso ISD Resolution to Support DREAMers and Families by BreitbartTexas on Scribd\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 23, "AuthorityVice": 4, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.6230529546737671, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 859, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 6.442370078740001, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 7, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 23, "mft_sum": 51, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161229160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.937136204889411, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 4.63636363636}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/jerusalem/2016/12/25/netanyahu-slams-obama-for-allowing-un-resolution-claiming-western-wall-is-occupied-territory-to-pass/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [239, 1592, 2449, 3078, 3731]}}, "headline": "Netanyahu: UN Resolution Claims Western Wall Is \u2018Occupied Territory\u2019", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1080, "date": "20161225140000", "story_content": "TEL AVIV \u2013 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slammed President Barack Obama for allowing the UN to \u201cgang up\u201d on Israel by passing a \u201cdisgraceful\u201d UN resolution that labels\u00a0the Western Wall and Jewish Quarter in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City occupied territory.\n\n\u201cThe resolution determines that the Jewish Quarter is occupied territory. It determines that the Western Wall, the Kotel, is occupied territory. There is no greater absurdity than that,\u201d Netanyahu said Saturday evening at a Hannukah lighting ceremony for IDF soldiers and veterans and victims of terror.\n\nKnesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein (Likud) also attacked the Obama administration, saying, \u201cThe UN, whose chief [outgoing Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon] only recently admitted is an organization biased against Israel, made an absurd decision because of the lack of leadership the U.S. has demonstrated over the last few years.\u201d\n\nEdelstein added, \u201cIf the Western Wall and Ramot [in Jerusalem] are occupied territories, then the UN must determine that New York should be immediately returned to the Indians.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu said that the \u201cdistorted and disgraceful\u201d resolution was \u201cthe last straw,\u201d but vowed that Israel would \u201covercome\u201d it and \u201creevaluate all of our ties to the UN within a month.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister further announced that he had already cut nearly $8 million in funding for five UN institutions he deemed \u201cparticularly hostile\u201d towards Israel.\n\nNetanyahu also recalled the Israeli ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal, two of the countries that proposed\u00a0Friday\u2019s UN Security Council anti-settlement resolution along with Venezuela. He also cut all Israeli government aid to Senegal, saying, \u201cThose who work with us will gain, because Israel has a lot to offer the nations of the world. But those who stand against us will lose, because there will be a diplomatic and economic price for their actions against Israel.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister also canceled an official visit to Israel by Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman in protest of Ukraine\u2019s vote in favor of the resolution.\n\nNetanyahu decried Obama for reneging on his own past policies regarding anti-Israel resolutions at the UN.\n\n\u201cAll of the U.S. presidents after [Jimmy] Carter met the American commitment not to try and dictate to Israel at the Security Council conditions for a final-status agreement. And yesterday, in complete contradiction to\u00a0this commitment\u2014including a specific commitment made by President Obama himself in 2011\u2014the Obama administration carried out a disgraceful anti-Israel underhanded move at the UN.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu argued that \u201cnot only does the resolution not promote peace, it pushes it further away.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu said it was \u201cabsurd\u201d that the Obama administration and UN Security Council chose to \u201charass the only democracy in the Middle East, the State of Israel\u201d while \u201chalf a million people are being massacred in Syria, tens of thousands are slaughtered in Sudan and the entire Middle East is going up in flames.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister also claimed\u00a0that the U.S. had a direct hand in drafting the resolution and re-introducing it at the UN after a similar resolution presented by Egypt was shelved on Thursday.\n\n\"We have no doubt that the Obama administration initiated it, stood behind it, coordinated its versions and insisted upon its passage,\" he said at Sunday\u2019s weekly cabinet meeting.\n\nHe vowed to \u201ccancel\u201d this resolution \u201cjust as we rejected the [1975] UN resolution that equated Zionism with racism,\" noting that \u201cit took a while, but that decision was canceled. It\u2019ll take time, but this decision will be canceled as well,\u201d adding that the way to do so will not be through \u201cconcessions\u201d but\u00a0through Israel and its \u201callies standing firm.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister announced that the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump said it would embark \u201con an all-out-war against this resolution.\u201d\n\n\u201cI spoke to many American leaders yesterday. I was happy to hear from the American congressmen\u2014Democrats and Republicans alike\u2014that they will fight this resolution with all means at their disposal,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy friends, we are entering a new era that, as President-elect Trump said yesterday, is coming much sooner than most think. In this new era, there will be a steep price to pay, a much steeper price to pay, for those who try to harm Israel. And this price will be exacted not just by the United States, but also by Israel.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to find a silver lining, Netanyahu said the resolution may have the effect of improving ties with countries around the world who side with Israel.\n\n\u201cIt recruits our many friends in the United States and elsewhere in the world who tire of the UN\u2019s hostile treatment of Israel, and they plan to bring to a change at the UN,\u201d Netanyahu said.\n\n\u201cHere on the eve of Hanukkah, I stand next to the modern-day Maccabees\u2014IDF soldiers and wounded soldiers. I salute you and say this clearly: Light will banish the darkness. The spirit of the Maccabees will come out on top,\u201d he concluded.\n\nDeparting from decades of U.S. policy regarding Israel at the UN \u2013 including, until now, the policy of the Obama administration itself \u2013 the U.S. decided to forego its automatic veto and abstained from voting on the resolution. The resolution declares all settlements illegal under international law and demands that Israel immediately cease construction in eastern Jerusalem, the West Bank and other territories captured in the 1967 defensive war.\n\nEarlier in the day, an Israeli official said that Washington\u2019s decision to abstain \u201cwas President Obama\u2019s final ploy. This is an act that exposed the administration\u2019s true face.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow it is easier to understand what we\u2019ve been dealing with over the past eight years,\u201d the official continued. \u201cThis move was expected. Prime Minister Netanyahu warned it might come. There were also discussions in the cabinet about it.\u201d\n\nEnergy Minister Yuval Steinitz slammed Obama for \u201cabandoning\u201d Israel \u201cto the anti-Israeli trend in the UN.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t an anti-settlement resolution, it was an anti-Israel resolution,\u201d Steinitz told Israeli news site Ynet.\n\nJustice Minister Ayelet Shaked (Bayit Yehudi) also condemned the Obama administration for being \u201ccowardly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a very pathetic move. The Obama administration had a lot of time and many years to influence Israel, and hurting Israel like that in [the administration\u2019s] last month is a cowardly act in my opinion,\u201d she said.\n\nMeanwhile, Education Minister Naftali Bennett said the resolution was the direct result of the \u201cOslo policy of concessions and withdrawals.\u201d He called for Israel to apply Israeli law and full sovereignty over the main West Bank settlements.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.31718063354492, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1033, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 7, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.2599641626599998, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161225140000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.4201355275895495, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/12/15/report-40000-pro-assad-christians-aleppo-fear-return-rebels/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [752]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 704, "scraper_regex": 742}}, "headline": "Report: 40,000 Pro-Assad Christians in Aleppo Fear Return of Rebels", "wordcount_as_scraped": 742, "date": "20161215090000", "story_content": "The estimated 40,000 Christians in Aleppo are not among the civilians who are dreading the fall of the city to the Russia and Iran-backed regime of dictator Bashar al Assad, according to a charity group that helps persecuted Christians.\n\nThese Christians instead reportedly fear the return of the rebels to Aleppo, particularly the jihadi coalition known as Jaish Al Fatah, or 'Army of Conquest,' that includes the likes of the Syrian al-Qaeda branch formerly known as the Nusra Front before it became Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (Front for the Conquest of the Levant).\n\nJaish Al Fatah has been \"heavily involved\" in the battle for Aleppo and the persecution of Christians in the city, claims\u00a0the charity group Barnabas Fund.\n\nUntil recently, Aleppo city had been roughly divided between Assad regime control in the west and rebel control in the east since 2012.\n\nThe Russian government and the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which uses a network of ground sources to monitor the ongoing civil war in Syria, have declared that the Assad regime is now in control of Aleppo.\n\nRussian-backed Assad forces and their Iranian-allied counterparts operating on the ground have been accused of \u201cgenocide\u201d against civilians in the former rebel stronghold of eastern Aleppo.\n\nNevertheless, the Barnabas Fund reports:\n\nChristians fled the persecution that the rebel fighters brought to that area [eastern Aleppo] of the city long ago. On Saturday (6 August) rebel forces succeeded in breaking the Syrian army's stranglehold on the main supply route into Aleppo, but as a result the bombing has only intensified.\nThe Christians now have to face a new fear: that Islamist rebels will gain ground and they will again find themselves in rebel-held territory, where they will become targets, both for their faith and their support of the Syrian government.\n\nChristians and Muslims in the Middle East lived peacefully with each other for hundreds of years. However, when jihadist groups such as the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) and al-Qaeda invaded Iraq and Syria in 2014, the terrorists ordered Christians to either leave, convert, or pay a subjugation tax.\n\nISIS has been accused of carrying out genocide against the Christians and other ethno-religious minorities in Iraq and Syria.\n\n\"It is like going back 1,000 years seeing the barbarity that Christians are having to live under. I think we are dealing with a group which makes Nazism pale in comparison and I think they have lost all respect for human life,\" explained Patrick Sookhdeo, founder of Barnabas Fund in 2015. \"Crucifying these people is sending a message and they are using forms of killing which they believe have been sanctioned by Sharia law. For them what they are doing is perfectly normal and they don't see a problem with it. It is that religious justification which is so appalling.\"\n\n\"We are facing terrorist action in the whole geography of Syria,\" Rev. Ibrahim Nseir, pastor of the National Evangelical Synod of Syria and Lebanon and the Presbyterian Church in Aleppo, told Fox News from the ISIS de-facto Syrian capital of Raqqa in May. \"They are destroying our churches, killing and kidnapping Christians, stealing our homes and our businesses.\"\n\nIraq and Syria are considered the cradle of human civilization and the Christian faith.\n\n\"It was on the road to Damascus that the Apostle Paul experienced his conversion to Christianity, and Syria remains one of the few sacred locales where the language of Aramaic \u2013 the language of Jesus \u2013 can still be heard,\" noted Fox News.\n\n\"In the 1920s, Christians \u2014 mainly Greek Catholic and Greek Orthodox \u2014 made up nearly a third of the Syrian population,\" it added. \"By the time civil war erupted in 2011, Christians in Syria numbered just 2.2 million, or less than 10 percent of the nation's population.

Mystery has surrounded the abduction of the young woman who had seemed to vanish \u2014 her phone, headphones and strands of her hair found by a mailbox down the road from their family home on the day of her disappearance.\n\nFamily, friends, law enforcement and strangers showed up to help search for the woman as police\u00a0began investigating what exactly happened.\n\nA GoFundMe campaign raised approximately $50,000 to aid in the search for the young mom.\n\nThen came Cameron Gamble. Gamble calls himself an international kidnapping and ransom consultant, and was retained by an anonymous donor according to his own account. Mr. Papini said in the interview with 20/20 that the anonymous contributor contacted him and suggested the use of Gamble as a different way of trying to rescue his wife.\n\n20/20 reported that Gamble is a former U.S. Air Force senior airman who now trains military, law enforcement and private citizens on \"how to evade and escape capture.\"\n\nKeith Papini was willing to try almost any suggestion. \"There was no idea or thought that if I think could work, that I was not going to try.\" He didn't let skeptics \u2014\u00a0like the local sheriff, according to the interviewer \u2014 dissuade him.\n\nWith the husband's consent, 12 days into Sherri Papini's disappearance, Gable posted a video online in which he spoke to the camera, addressed the kidnappers and offered a ransom for Sherri Papini's return.\n\nWhen Mrs. Papini wasn't returned by November 23, Gamble posted a second video to the Internet in which he again addressed the kidnappers, saying that the time for them to collect their ransom had passed and an increased reward amount would now be offered to any member of the public who found Sherri. \"I wanted to make it so tempting that the abductor's own mother would have turned him in,\" Gamble told 20/20.\n\nThen, on November 24, early Thanksgiving morning, Keith Papini received\u00a0a call to his cell phone that he missed, followed by a call to his home phone that he picked up only to hear, as he describes it, his wife screaming on the other end of the phone. A sheriff responding to a holiday traveler's 9-1-1 call about a woman on the side of the road led the deputy to Sherri. He was there with her when she was finally able to make the call to her husband.\n\nA San Diego private investigator who volunteered in searching for the young woman told 10 News in a Friday evening report that aired after the 20/20 special that he believes the abduction was related to human trafficking.\n\nAn account of Sherri's release detailed in the 20/20 report described a shackled woman who\u00a0was pushed out of a car onto the side of a road. She was said to then have taken a bag off her head; run to try and find\u00a0help at a house, then a building; then tried to stop motorists. Finally, a woman saw her, pulled off the road and called 9-1-1. Radio transmissions from first responders described Sherri as \"heavily battered\" and the cause, \"It is going to be some sort of an assault.\"\n\nShe had been found in Yolo County, California, 150 miles from her home in Redding.\n\nKeith Papini said officers warned him of her condition and that she had been \"branded.\" He described intense bruising and bumps on her face, and said her long hair had been chopped off. The already slim woman had lost 15 percent of her body weight in 22 days.\n\nThe report identified four possible scenarios police may be investigating. One is that it was a local crime possibly involving a sex offender in the area. All leads in connection with that\u00a0theory failed to produce results.\n\nTheory two was that the couple carried out a hoax. Mike Mangas of KRCR-TV in Redding told 20/20 that he could not believe someone would\u00a0have been\u00a0beaten so severely just for money.\n\nTheory three was that Sherri was abducted for the purpose of sex trafficking. Gamble suggested that the branding is indicative of this and that it would be done to \"mark a girl.\" Others have suggested the brutal treatment of Sherri may not fit the sex trafficking theory and pointed to a different potential motive.\n\nTheory four was that a cult abducted her. Brad Garrett, an ABC News crime expert and former FBI profiler, suggested 22 days of intense physical agony and mental torture was used to try and break her will. If that is the case, more people could be in the group's captivity now.\n\nThe law enforcement investigation into Sherri Papini's 22 day disappearance is ongoing.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.672969818115231, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 822, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.53243423222, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 15, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161204140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.82481751824817, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.36363636364}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/01/05/police-chicago-victims-parents-received-taunting-messages/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Police: Chicago Torture Victim\u2019s Parents Received Taunting Messages", "wordcount_as_scraped": 901, "date": "20170106040000", "story_content": "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Four black people were charged with hate crimes Thursday in connection with a video broadcast live on Facebook that showed a mentally disabled white man being beaten and taunted, threatened with a knife and forced to drink from a toilet.\n\nThe assault went on for hours, until Chicago police found the disoriented victim walking along a street, authorities said.\n\nThe suspects, who were jailed, can be heard on the video using profanities against white people and President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nPolice spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said investigators initially concluded that the 18-year-old man was singled out because he has \u201cspecial needs,\u201d not because he was white. But authorities later said the charges resulted from both the suspects\u2019 use of racial slurs and their references to the victim\u2019s disability.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that the suspects were trying to extort something from the victim\u2019s family, police said. The man\u2019s parents reported their son missing Monday and told authorities they later received text messages from people who claimed to be holding him captive.\n\nThe victim was a classmate of one of the attackers and initially went with that person voluntarily, police said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s traumatized by the incident, and it\u2019s very tough to communicate with him at this point,\u201d police Cmdr. Kevin Duffin said.\n\nExcerpts of the video posted by Chicago media outlets show the victim with his mouth taped shut and slumped in a corner of a room. At least two assailants are seen cutting off his sweatshirt, and others taunt him off camera. The video shows a wound on the top of the man\u2019s head. One person pushes the man\u2019s head with his or her foot.\n\nA red band also appears to be around the victim\u2019s hands. He was tied up for four to five hours, authorities said.\n\nThe victim does not appear to make any attempt to defend himself or to escape his attackers. He is a suburban Chicago resident described by Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson as having \u201cmental health challenges.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was never a question whether or not this incident qualified as being investigated as a hate crime,\u201d Johnson said. But \u201cwe need to base the investigation on facts and not emotion.\u201d\n\nThe case heightened political tensions on social media, with some conservatives suggesting it was linked to the Black Lives Matter movement. Police said there was no indication of any connection.\n\nThe incident began Dec. 31, when the victim and one of the suspects, 18-year-old Jordan Hill, met at a suburban McDonald\u2019s to begin what both the victim and his parents believed would be a sleepover, police said.\n\nInstead, Hill drove the victim around in a stolen van for a couple of days, ending up at a home in Chicago, where two of the other suspects lived, detective Cmdr. Kevin Duffin said.\n\nThe victim told police what began as playful fighting escalated, and he was bound, beaten and taunted with racial slurs and disparaging comments about his mental capacity.\n\nA downstairs neighbor who heard noises threatened to call police. When two of the suspects left and kicked down the neighbor\u2019s door, the victim escaped. A police officer later spotted the obviously disoriented man wandering down a street.\n\nThe man was bloodied and wearing a tank top that was inside-out and backward. He had on jean shorts and sandals, despite freezing weather, officer Michael Donnelly said.\n\nMost hate crimes are connected to the victim\u2019s race, but hate-crime charges can be sought in Illinois if a victim\u2019s mental disability sparked an attack, though it is rare.\n\nIn addition to hate crimes, the four were charged with kidnapping, aggravated battery and aggravated unlawful restraint. Three were also charged with burglary. It was unclear whether any of the suspects had attorneys. They were to appear in court Friday.\n\nFamily members of the victim spoke briefly to reporters Thursday at a suburban hotel but declined to comment on the allegations or the investigation.\n\nNeal Strom, who is acting as a family spokesman, told The Associated Press that the victim has had \u201cprofound emotional and physical disabilities throughout his life.\u201d He did not elaborate.\n\nThe grandmother of a young woman associated with the video said the granddaughter she raised from infancy is \u201cnot this person.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so upset, my head is about to bust open,\u201d said Priscilla Covington of Chicago. \u201cI don\u2019t know if someone influenced her \u2026 She had her ups and down. (She) was a good person. I\u2019m so confused.\u201d\n\nIn Washington, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the beating demonstrated \u201ca level of depravity that is an outrage to a lot of Americans.\u201d He said he had not yet spoken to President Barack Obama about the attack in the president\u2019s hometown.\n\nCook County prosecutors identified the suspects as Brittany Covington and Tesfaye Cooper, both of Chicago, and Hill, of suburban Carpentersville. All are 18. A fourth suspect was identified as 24-year-old Tanishia Covington, also of Chicago.\n\nThe video emerged at a time when police dealings with Chicago\u2019s black community are being closely watched. Less than a year ago, the nation\u2019s third-largest police force was sharply criticized by a task force for using excessive force and honoring a code of silence.\n\nThe department has also been the subject of a long civil-rights investigation by the Justice Department, which is expected to report its findings soon.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 19, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -10.129310607910199, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 871, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 5.35052326166, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 19, "mft_sum": 34, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170106040000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.90355912743972, "mft_mean": 3.0909090909099994}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/12/20/glenn-beck-samantha-bee-teaming-fight-trumpism/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [80, 277, 295, 369, 435, 2384, 2680, 2837, 3124, 3165, 3245, 3260, 3314, 3325, 3333, 3773, 3795, 3837, 3846, 3914, 3997, 4030, 4035, 4047, 4058, 4077, 4089, 4107, 4137, 4217, 4262, 4354, 4363, 4377, 4388]}}, "headline": "Samantha Bee Unites with \u2018Changed\u2019 Glenn Beck to Fight \u2018Trumpism\u2019", "wordcount_as_scraped": 737, "date": "20161220200000", "story_content": "Talk radio host\u00a0Glenn Beck and left-wing late night host Samantha Bee are ramping up their efforts to provide \u201cnonpartisan\u201d pushback against the incoming Donald Trump administration.\n\nOn Monday\u2019s episode of Bee\u2019s\u00a0Full Frontal, she\u00a0sat down with Beck, and the two supposedly diametrically opposed TV stars\u00a0discussed how they plan to unite to fight \u201cTrumpism.\u201d\n\n\n\nSporting\u00a0ugly Christmas sweaters, Beck and Bee began their \u201chealing\u201d process by sharing what each of their respective audiences believes about the other\u2019s.\n\n\u201cMy audience would like to stab you relentlessly in the eye,\u201d Beck joked.\n\n\u201cMy audience wants to kill me for normalizing a lunatic like yourself,\u201d Bee responded.\n\nBee nonetheless said that \u201cmuch of Glenn\u2019s message has changed\u201d and said TheBlaze founder, to her apparent chagrin, \u201cseems to be a deeply sincere and decent person.\u201d Bee commended Beck for taking heat from conservatives when he came out publicly against Trump, and again when he provided toys and food to the children of illegal immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\u201c[I] tried to teach my audience, \u2018They\u2019re children!'\u201d Beck told Bee. \u201cYes, you can be against illegal immigration, but they\u2019re children, and they\u2019re here, and they\u2019re humans.\u201d\n\nBee offered an explanation for Beck\u2019s appearance on her show.\n\n\u201cI think that our future is going to require a broad coalition of nonpartisan decency. It's not just individual people against Donald Trump; it's all of us against Trumpism,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI agree,\u201d Beck replied. \u201cAs a guy who has done damage, I don't want to do any more damage. I know what I did. I helped divide. I'm willing to take that. My message to you is: Please don't make the mistakes I made. And I think all of us are doing it. We're doing it on Facebook, we're doing it on Twitter. We tear each other apart and we don't see the human on the other side.\u201d\n\nBeck joked with Bee that he is a \u201ccatastrophist\u201d and informed her that she has become one too, rattling off a series of doomsday events that they both agree could come to pass during a Trump presidency.\n\n\u201cDo you believe there's a chance we fall into a dictatorship under Donald Trump?\" asked Beck. \"Do you believe there's a chance we lose our freedom of speech and press under this president?\"\n\nBee\u2019s realization that she and Beck were \u201cbecoming allies,\u201d threw the\u00a0comedienne into a \u201cChristmas crisis.\u201d\n\nBeck also said Bee is just like he was, and said he believes that she cares about bringing positive change.\n\nLater, Beck and Bee literally reached out to each other and began holding hands.\n\n\u201cOur skins are touching,\u201d Bee cringed.\n\nThe bizarre bit ends with\u00a0Bee gifting Beck a \u201cStrange Bedfellows\u201d cake of the pair lying together in a bed. The two then take turns eating each other\u2019s cake head.\n\nTheBlaze founder\u2019s\u00a0appearance on the TBS late night show came about a week after Bee joined Beck\u2019s news program for an hour-long discussion about how much they both fear Trump.\n\nFor Beck, however, Monday night\u2019s was the latest stop on his months-long \u201capology tour.\u201d\n\nThe conservative pundit has been busy\u00a0rebranding his image. In September, Beck\u00a0penned a heartfelt message of support and \u201cempathy\u201d for Black Lives Matter in a\u00a0New York Times\u00a0op-ed. As Breitbart reported, \u201c[i]n early November, a\u00a0New Yorker\u00a0profile\u00a0of Beck explained that he had \"rethought some things\" after listening to a recent speech by Michelle Obama that he praised as \"the most effective political speech I have heard since Ronald Reagan.\" The article described Beck as a \"Black Lives Matter supporter\" and quoted him praising the president he once harshly criticized, declaring that Barack Obama made him \"a better man.\"\n\nA supporter of Ted Cruz\u2019s White House bid, Beck has called\u00a0President-elect Trump\u00a0a \u201cdanger to the republic.\u201d Beck has also\u00a0compared\u00a0White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon to Nazi propagandist\u00a0Joseph Goebbels.\n\nAs Breitbart previously reported, \u201c[d]uring the campaign, [Beck]\u00a0regularly described Donald Trump\u00a0as a\u00a0Hitler-like\u00a0psychopath\u00a0with supporters he\u00a0compared to\u00a0Nazi Brownshirts.\u00a0The former radio shock jock's\u00a0disdain for Trump reached a crescendo in April, when he donned swim goggles and\u00a0rubbed his face in a bowl of crushed Cheetos\u00a0to see if he could \u2018look like Donald Trump.'\u201d\n\nWatch the video of the full segment above.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFollow\u00a0Jerome Hudson\u00a0on Twitter\u00a0@jeromeehudson", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.2285012006759601, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 1, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 705, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.9750509984, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 2, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161220200000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.97872340425532, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/12/07/historian-craig-shirley-pearl-harbor-december-7th-linchpin-history-america/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [9698, 9711]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1485, "scraper_regex": 1620}}, "headline": "Historian Craig Shirley on Pearl Harbor: 'December 7 Is the Linchpin of History for America'", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1620, "date": "20161207220000", "story_content": "Historian Craig Shirley, author of December 1941: 31 Days that Changed America and Saved the World, joined SiriusXM host Matt Boyle on Wednesday's Breitbart News Daily to commemorate the 75th anniversary of Pearl Harbor.\n\n\"December 7th is the linchpin of history for America,\" Shirley declared. \"On December 6th, America was kind of a tired and run-down country, with no real national mission other than trying to get out of the Great Depression. By December 8th, we had become revolutionized and revitalized as a young and vibrant country, with a national mission that later translated into the mission to defeat Soviet Communism. But first, we had to the Empire of Japan and Nazi Germany.\"\n\nLISTEN:\n\n\n\n\"It's really quite remarkable. You know, you think about all the things \u2013 whether the space program, or John Kennedy's presidency, or Ronald Reagan's presidency, or Dwight Eisenhower's presidency \u2013 all of them stem directly from Pearl Harbor,\" he mused. \"Had Pearl Harbor not existed, these men would not have been President of the United States. We might never have landed on the moon. There would be no United Nations. There would be no internationalism or neoconservatism, or Bush, or any of those other things which all have, in some way, derived their policies and their programs from December 7th and the aftermath of December 7th. So it is the pick-lock of history.\"\n\nShirley set the stage for the attack by noting \"there had been, historically, a good, warm relationship between Japan and the United States.\"\n\n\"Japan had been a closed society for three decades, until Matthew Perry, Admiral Perry, sailed into Tokyo Harbor in the 1850s and began an open-door \u2013 not the open-door policy, but an open-door policy. From that time forward, there had been strong trade relations, strong cultural relations, strong educational relations between Japan and the United States,\" he recalled. \"They were our ally in World War I. They were on our side against the Germans. When the end of the Sino-Japanese War took place in 1905, President Roosevelt, Teddy Roosevelt, negotiated the peace talks, for which he won the Nobel Peace Prize, and the Japanese felt that Roosevelt had bent over backwards to see their point of view in the war, so they always had warm affection for Teddy Roosevelt, and hence the United States.\"\n\n\"We began to diverge after World War I,\" he continued. \"A shogunate culture, a very militaristic, macho shogunate culture begins to take root in Japan, and they start to build up their war machine. They almost revert back to the Dark Ages in many ways: Women don't have rights. It's a manly culture. It's a macho culture. It's a very bullish, arrogant culture.\"\n\n\"We also passed laws restricting Asiatic immigration into the United States, and then we passed restrictive trade bills, and then we passed the Neutrality Acts of the 1930s,\" Shirley added. \"So by the 1930s, we're barely talking to each other, and it's not very warmly. And, of course, Japan, to feed its expansionist military, needs natural resources, and we're an impediment to that. Our fleet in the Pacific is an impediment to their expansionist policies.\" \n\n\"So there's only one solution, which is one massive stroke to decapitate all the British and American military presence in the central and western Pacific, and that's what they did on December 7, 1941,\" he said.\n\nHe described that day as a typical Sunday morning. \"Some people are going to church. Some people are sleeping off hangovers. One guy I knew was on the deck of the Nevada. He's a Navy seaman. He was on KP duty and was peeling potatoes, when all of a sudden, 150 Japanese airplanes drop out of the sky with what they referred to as the 'giant meatball' on the side, the big red painting on the side of the planes. He has nothing in his hands except for potatoes, and as these planes are whizzing by, he's throwing potatoes at these Japanese bombers and fighters, trying to do something, trying to do some sort of damage.\"\n\n\"We were completely unprepared. We were completely asleep. No anti-aircraft fire, no guns, no ship movement, no nothing. We were just completely naked in the morning sun, left exposed to be decimated by the Japanese,\" Shirley said.\n\nHe noted that communications in 1941 were not what they are today, but people still found out about it within minutes, \"either through the radio broadcasts or later through newspapers that were rushed out a couple of hours after the attack, very thin newspapers that announced the attack.\"\n\n\"They found out gossiping over the fence with their neighbors or in church: 'Did you hear about the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor?' So everybody was pretty much up to speed,\" he said. \"They didn't have the details. A lot of rumors took hold, and a lot of things people got wrong, but they understood that Japan had attacked America at Pearl Harbor. That they understood. And America's resolve changed instantly. We changed instantly from an isolationist country to an internationalist country, at least in terms of going to war with Japan.\"\n\n\"There's no resistance whatsoever. There's no pacifists. There's no leftists. There's not one editorial, not one columnist, only one member of Congress \u2013 Jeannette Rankin, a Republican from Montana \u2013 votes against our entry into the Pacific war. It passed the House with just her, overwhelmingly obviously, and it passes the Senate 83 to nothing, with no objections whatsoever. Within only several hours after Roosevelt asked Congress for a declaration of war does he get one, and he signs it, and he says, 'This is it,' and he realizes now the United States is plunging into a war that they desperately wanted to avoid,\" Shirley said.\n\n\"Everything changes in America,\" he said. \"We stop announcing ship movements and troop movements. We get used to blackouts. We get used to roadblocks. Japanese nationals begin to be rounded up. All reserves are canceled. Everybody's to go back into their uniform, which they'd been wearing civvies most of the time. Gas rationing starts to take hold quickly, food rationing, sugar rationing, coffee rationing. Scrap metal drives, paper drives, rubber drives all take place very, very quickly after December 7th, and the nation is transformed within a matter of days and weeks after December 7th.\" \n\n\"The arsenal of democracy is such that within three weeks of December 7th, Ford Motor Company, along with Fisher Auto Body and Goodyear Tire, stops producing cars \u2013 which by the way, Washington told people are complaining about Trump manipulating businesses. FDR manipulated and directed every business in America for four years,\" he observed. \"Washington told Detroit, 'You are no longer to build new cars,' and Detroit said okay. So Detroit starts churning out fabricated B-24 and B-25 bombers made out of the parts of new cars that were going to be made.\" \n\n\"Kelvinator in Chicago, which made coffee pots and things like that \u2013 everybody. Children became part of the war effort, with victory gardens and scrap drives, and old people by saving grease, which was used for the treads on tanks. Everybody contributed in some way, shape, or form to the war effort,\" Shirley said.\n\nHe called World War II \"the most democratic war that you could imagine\" because of the way it unified the country and involved people from every walk of life.\n\n\"In Vietnam, there was the college deferment. In the Civil War, you could buy your way out of service. But for World War II, everybody of draftable age was drafted. Those who weren't, tried to enlist. And if they didn't enlist and they weren't drafted, then they found some other way to serve their country,\" he observed.\n\nShirley said it was interesting to recall that \"Churchill had been lobbying FDR for months\" to support Britain, which he accurately presented as the \"last line of defense against Nazism,\" but \"there was no will in this country for getting involved in another European war after World War I.\"\n\n\"Even after the attack, there's no linkage whatsoever between the attack at Pearl Harbor and our getting into the European war. The reason we get into the European war is four days after the attack, Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini declare war on the United States because of the Tripartite Pact with Japan, which was a mutual defense agreement,\" he pointed out. \"So, therefore, we have to respond, so we declare war on Germany and Italy. But there's no evidence whatsoever that would have gotten involved in the European war after Pearl Harbor, until Hitler and Italy declare war on the United States.\"\n\nThe war America fought with Japan was exceptionally long and brutal, for as Shirley explained, Japanese military culture held it \"better to die\" than be taken captive.\n\n\"The Japanese soldier fought tenaciously and to the very death because they actually preferred death to being taken hostage or being taken prisoner, so it was a long slog over all these tiny atolls and islands, over three, four thousand miles across the Pacific, to invade them and to eradicate them. Guadalcanal was the tail of a bloody, bloody conflict which took months, and many, many American lives were lost,\" he said. \n\n\"And we haven't even mentioned the wounded,\" Shirley added. \"We lost in World War II something like 275,000 men, I believe, but it was well over a million wounded men [who] lost limbs, lost arms, lost their eyesight, lost their hearing \u2013 in some way, shape, or form were somehow badly damaged by the war effort. The casualties were exceedingly high in some instances, like Anzio in Europe.\"\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\u00a0to 9:00 a.m.\u00a0Eastern.\n\nListen to the complete audio of the interview above.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 21, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.36341905593872, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1485, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 37, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 11.349445684900001, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 37, "mft_sum": 67, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 2, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161207220000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.51178451178451, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 6.090909090909999}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/news/the-latest-romney-honored-to-have-been-considered-for-state/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 549, "scraper_regex": 583}}, "headline": "AP: Romney Out of Running for Sec. of State", "wordcount_as_scraped": 583, "date": "20161213060000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on President-elect Donald Trump (all times EST):\n\n10 p.m.\n\nMitt Romney appears to be out of the running for secretary of state, writing on Facebook that it \u201cwas an honor to have been considered\u201d for the job in Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet.\n\nRomney writes: \u201cMy discussions with President-elect Trump have been both enjoyable and enlightening.

And the film certainly earns every bit of that rating, which seems odd for a film about a pacifist.\n\nAndrew Garfield (The Amazing Spider-Man, The Social Network) is Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his courage under fire during 1945\u2019s Battle of Okinawa. What makes his story so unique is that due to his Seventh Day Adventist faith, Doss did not believe in killing and would not touch guns, even under the extraordinary circumstances of war. Armed with only\u00a0a small Bible and his prayers, Doss ventured into the hellfire of war and saved the lives of approximately 75 of his fellow soldiers.\n\nHacksaw Ridge\u00a0essentially fits two movies into its 131-minute runtime, not unlike Stanley Kubrick\u2019s masterpiece Full Metal Jacket. There\u2019s the before-the-war first half, which centers on Doss\u2019s turbulent upbringing under his abusive father Tom (Hugo Weaving), himself a veteran of the Great War, and his budding relationship with a nurse, Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer), whom he meets after saving a young man\u2019s life and accompanying him to the local hospital.\n\nThe early scenes of Desmond\u2019s courtship of Dorothy are almost gratingly saccharine and squeaky-clean, but soon our young protagonist is off to join the military, following the lead of his brother Harold (Nathaniel Buzolic), after first asking Dorothy to marry him. The young nurse gives Doss a pocket Bible and a small photograph of herself, and then he\u2019s\u00a0on the bus to basic training, with no clue of the hardship and horror he is shortly to face.\n\nThe film picks up quickly at boot camp, where Doss\u2019 faith and his refusal to train with a rifle quickly ruffle the feathers of his fellow would-be\u00a0soldiers and his superiors. Vince Vaughn steals every scene he is in as tough-talking, insult-spewing Sgt. Howell, who comes under tremendous pressure from Cpt. Glover (Sam Worthington) to get the holier-than-thou Christian do-gooder off of his base. When good old-fashioned hazing and an attempt to get Doss branded a psychiatric liability prove unsuccessful, a legal battle ensues as Col. Sangston (Robert Morgan) slaps Doss with a court-martial for refusing to comply with direct orders. Throughout it all, Doss repeatedly turns to God for answers.\n\nNeedless to say, Doss is finally allowed to train as a combat medic and is soon on his way to what would become one of the bloodiest battles of World War II. Here, Gibson is at the top of his game. The last hour of the film plays more like a horror film than a war drama, and Gibson\u2019s depiction of the hellish insanity of war has not been equaled onscreen since perhaps 1998\u2019s Saving Private Ryan.\n\nThrough the haze of\u00a0exploding limbs, raining blood, slicing bayonets and the booms of machine-gun fire, Doss does his work\u00a0patiently and efficiently. Gibson directs the bloody melee unflinchingly but without reveling in the carnage, even as soldiers like Smitty (Luke Bracey) come up with increasingly creative methods to stay alive, including using the corpse of a fallen comrade as a human shield.\n\nLike all war films about real-life subjects, Hacksaw Ridge sometimes veers into hagiographic territory. The film\u2019s unabashed patriotism and earnest religious themes will undoubtedly piss off perpetually jaded atheists. But one of the film\u2019s key features is that, much like its protagonist, it refrains from making moral judgements on the soldiers, their motivations, the war and the power of religious conviction.\n\nOf course, Gibson brings his own baggage to the film. His last stint in the director\u2019s chair was for Apocalypto all the way back in 2006, the same year in which he was recorded shouting anti-Semitic remarks at a police officer after being busted for drunk driving. Whether one can separate the man from his work is up to the individual viewer, and would be the subject of an entirely different article.\n\nWhat is clear is that in the intervening years, Gibson\u2019s knack for directing visceral, violent drama has not suffered a bit.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nFollow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.11440086364746, "HarmVice": 12, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 669, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.4401614415300004, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161103030000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 3.73692077727952, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/12/03/trump-staffs-strategic-policy-forum-h-1b-enthusiasts/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [449, 835, 865, 880, 905, 1040, 1636, 1969, 2088, 2540, 2686, 3350]}}, "headline": "Trump Staffs Strategic and Policy Forum with Some H-1B Enthusiasts", "wordcount_as_scraped": 578, "date": "20161204100000", "story_content": "President-elect Donald Trump is establishing a Strategic and Policy Forum, which will meet with him for the first time at the White House in February, to share ideas with Trump as he \u201cimplements his plan to bring back jobs,\u201d according to Trump\u2019s transition team.\n\nThe Forum will be comprised of many business leaders, but at least three of the 16 members have a history of supporting\u00a0the importation of foreign workers.\n\nFor example, Disney\u2019s CEO Bob Iger oversaw the firing and replacement of hundreds of American workers in late 2014. Iger had been a Hillary Clinton supporter during the 2016 election and even hosted a Hollywood fundraiser for Clinton in August at a billionaire\u2019s gated home in Beverly Hills.\n\nIger also serves as a co-chair of the Partnership for a\u00a0New American Economy, a group\u00a0that advocates\u00a0for the expansion of the\u00a0foreign worker H-1B program.\n\nOne of the principles of the Partnership for a New American Economy, according to its website is to grow\u00a0\u201copportunities for immigrants to enter the United States workforce \u2014 and for foreign students to stay in the United States to work \u2014 so that we can attract and keep the best, the brightest and the hardest-working, who will strengthen our economy.\u201d\n\nAnother Forum member, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, previously suggested foreign students should stay and work in the United States instead of returning home.\n\n\u201cAll these kids who come from around the world, who get advanced degrees, you know, our best universities in the world, science, technology, and we send them home,\u201d Dimon\u00a0stated.\n\nStudents must request a visa to stay in the United States after one year post-graduation as they are permitted to work in America for the first year after they receive their degree, according to The Hill.\n\n\u201cLet them stay, let them build companies. A lot of these companies were built by immigrants,\u201d Dimon stated.\n\nAlso the\u00a0President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Doug McMillon sits on Trump\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum, but as previously\u00a0reported, Wal-Mart has a history of importing foreign workers and displacing American workers through the H-1B visa program. For instance, the Huffington Post noted that \u201cWalmart filed 1,800 petitions for H-1B visas over the last eight years, with the annual number increasing from 79 in 2007 up to 513 in 2014.\u201d\n\n\"Walmart is driving down standards in the tech industry in the U.S. by using H-1B visas and contractors excessively,\" read a 2015 AFL-CIO\u00a0report. \"This keeps costs low and allows for IT guest workers to be paid less.\"\n\nOther members on Trump\u2019s Forum include:\n\nThe group is chaired by\u00a0Co-founder and CEO of Blackstone Stephen A. Schwarzman.\n\nAccording to Trump\u2019s press release, which was sent on Friday:\n\nMembers of the Forum will be charged with providing their individual views to the President \u2013 informed by their unique vantage points in the private sector \u2013 on how government policy impacts economic growth, job creation, and productivity. The Forum is designed to provide direct input to the President from many of the best and brightest in the business world in a frank, non-bureaucratic, and non-partisan manner.\n\n\"This forum brings together CEOs and business leaders who know what it takes to create jobs and drive economic growth,\" stated\u00a0Trump. \"My administration is committed to drawing on private sector expertise and cutting the government red tape that is holding back our businesses from hiring, innovating, and expanding right here in America.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.5923566818237298, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 557, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.64317543809, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 8, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161204100000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.9497307001795297, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.0}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2016/12/29/nyt-gushes-churches-offering-sanctuary-migrant-felons/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [4761], "\u00ef": [3378]}}, "headline": "NYT Gushes Over Churches Offering \u2018Sanctuary\u2019 to Migrant Felons", "wordcount_as_scraped": 713, "date": "20161229220000", "story_content": "In a faith-focused piece from The New York Times, the left-leaning paper gushes over religious institutions across the country offering \u201csanctuary\u201d to migrant felons.\n\nThe piece, titled \"Houses of Worship Poised to Serve as Trump-Era Immigrant Sanctuaries,\" showcases the movement known as \"Sanctuary Not Deportation,\" where churches help shield illegal immigrants from federal law enforcement.\n\nFor instance, The Times write-up mentions one church which is actively helping to harbor illegal immigrant felon Javier Flores Garcia of Mexico, who is facing deportation again after already being deported three times prior.\n\nFlores \"took refuge\" in the Arch Street United Methodist Church, according to The Times, after he bypassed federal immigration officials and failed to arrive for his scheduled deportation back to Mexico:\n\nThe federal immigration authorities say Mr. Flores has a long history of violations: He was apprehended nine times between 1997 and 2002 trying to cross the border. He re-entered and was ordered removed by a judge in 2007. He re-entered twice in 2014 and served prison sentences for illegal re-entry, a criminal felony conviction.\n\nFlores told the Times that his \"only crime is coming back,\" referring to the number of times federal immigration officials have had to deport the Mexican national.\n\nThe efforts by churches to shield illegal immigrants from federal laws has been ongoing throughout the Obama Administration, but is now being trotted out by the mainstream media more than ever, as President-Elect Donald Trump is set to head to Washington, D.C.\n\nUnder Trump's immigration policies, businesses will have to verify that their employees are legal residents in the country; foreign guest worker visa programs will see a crack-down; and a border wall is expected to be erected along the southern border.\n\nThe Times heralded the idea of illegal immigrants no longer having to rely on white Americans for help, quoting Pastor Salvatierra saying, \"We're in a different universe now. We don't need the white people to rescue us, thank you very much. We need to be in partnership.\"\n\nRev. Alison Harrington of the Southside Presbyterian Church compared her church's potential relocation of illegal immigrants from states with strict immigration policies to region's with more lax policies to the \"underground railroad\":\n\nSanctuary workers in the '80s organized a sort of \"underground railroad\" to move immigrants from dangerous regions to safer ones, and that may have to be reactivated, she told her workshop.\n\nThe Times also downplayed illegal immigrants involved in falsifying documentation papers and faking credit cards, quoting Rev. Donna Schaper of the Judson Memorial Church: \"We are talking mostly about white-collar crime. Faking credit cards. Faking IDs. Many of these people are quite middle class and well educated,\" she said, and they are not only Latinos, but also Chinese, Russians, Pakistanis and many others.\"\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, which is tasked with deporting individuals living in the country illegally, and Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) Policy Director Jessica Vaughn were only given two paragraphs in the Times write-up to counter the pro-illegal immigration narrative in the piece:\n\nBut some see sanctuary as misguided, or na\u00efve. Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports tighter controls on immigration, said she understood that churches had sympathy for people facing deportation. \"But I find myself wishing that they had as much sympathy for other parishioners they have who are adversely affected by illegal immigration\" because of jobs, higher taxes or crime.\nChurches, schools and hospitals are considered \"sensitive locations,\" according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Immigration officers are supposed to avoid those locations, unless they have advance approval from a supervisor or face \"exigent circumstances\" that require immediate action, said Jennifer Elzea, an agency spokeswoman.\n\nThe Times failed to mention how shielding illegal immigrants from federal law incentivizes more to flood the southern border, expecting protection once within the country.\n\nRecently, Breitbart Texas obtained photos from border-region citizens who encountered 21 illegal immigrants crossing the Rio Grande in a matter of minutes.\n\nThe illegal immigrants were moved throughout an area that is \"used by the Gulf Cartel to move illegal immigrants from Central America and countries other than Mexico across the Texas border with Mexico,\" Breitbart Texas reported at the time.\n\nJohn Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.

He took the occasion to slam populism, skepticism of free trade agreements, and suspicion of Chinese trade practices.\n\n\"Protectionism, populism and de-globalisation are on the rise. It's not good for closer economic cooperation globally,\" Xi declared.\n\n\"No one will emerge as a winner in a trade war,\" Xi warned, comparing protectionism to \"locking oneself in a dark room.\" He said globalism should not be blamed for most of the world's economic problems, and said there was \"no justification to write it off altogether,\" according to translations quoted by NPR.\n\n\"He said Beijing would not boost its trade competitiveness by devaluing its currency, something Trump has repeatedly said China has done in the past, and urged all signatories of a landmark climate deal in Paris last year to stick to the agreement,\" Reuters writes, adding that Xi \"cautioned other countries against blindly pursuing their national interests, in an apparent reference to the 'America first' policies of Donald Trump.\" \n\nJust about every media outlet has remarked upon the spectacle of a Chinese leader becoming the champion of global trade, while U.S. President-elect Donald Trump did not attend the forum. For example, the UK Guardian applauded Xi's \"rollicking defense of globalization that would have been unthinkable from a Chinese leader in the past,\" and said many of his remarks were \"aimed at one person who certainly isn't at Davos \u2013 Donald Trump.\"\n\nAnother note from the Guardian pithily described Davos without Trump as \"Hamlet without the prince,\" and said the new American president was \"dominating proceedings\" even though he wasn't there, because the assembled globalist leaders are \"worried by Trump's protectionist rhetoric,\" not to mention the way he won the 2016 election by \"tapping into deep-seated anger about the unfair distribution of the spoils of economic growth.\"\n\n\"There is a great need for China to step up and provide reassurance and confidence to the world on pushing ahead with \u00adglobalisation,\" Professor Zhang Shengjun of Beijing Normal University told the South China Morning Post.\n\nIt evidently did not occur to any of the Xi fans at Davos that if the authoritarian ruler of a repressive Communist country is the premiere spokesman for your ideology, there might just be something wrong with your ideology. \n\nWhat Xi mostly demonstrated at Davos was the ability to play the globalist crowd for suckers by appealing to their intellectual vanity. China suddenly gets a free pass for every rotten thing it has done \u2013 crushing political dissent, treating its poor like disposable garbage, turning the air into a roiling brown soup of pollution \u2013 because its leaders say the \"right things\" about globalism and environmentalist fetishes.\n\nA note of skepticism did seep into the latter paragraphs of these media accounts. The Guardian, for example, offered a few caveats:\n\nOf course; these speeches are often notable for what's missing; Xi didn't talk about Chinese dumping of steel on European markets, the Great Firewall preventing citizens getting full access to the Internet.\nAnd his talk about staying resolute in stormy seas won't comfort those in the west losing their jobs, either to automation or free trade.\n\nThis was accompanied by a trenchant Tweet from former UBS chief economist George Magnus: \"C\u2019mon Twitter, you think Xi JinPing is the new champion of free trade and a liberal trading order? Big show at Davos, I know, now calm down.\"\n\nReuters contented itself with noting that despite Xi's portrayal of China as a \"wide open\" economy, \"his government has come under mounting criticism from trading partners for its continued restrictions on foreign investments at a time when its state-run firms are aggressively pursuing acquisitions in Europe.\" \n\nOver at the Wall Street Journal, Xi is called out as an \"ardent nationalist in the role of flag-bearer for globalization,\" whose demand for \"absolute state sovereignty\" is at least equal to anything Donald Trump has talked about. His idea of \"globalism\" is not at all what most of the Davos grandees have in mind when they applaud him for defending it.\n\nXi's speech at Davos was filled with facile arguments like this:\n\nThe point I want to make is that many of the problems troubling the world are not caused by economic globalization. For instance, the refugee waves from the Middle East and North Africa in recent years have become a global concern. Several million people have been displaced, and some small children lost their lives while crossing the rough sea. This is indeed heartbreaking. It is war, conflict and regional turbulence that have created this problem, and its solution lies in making peace, promoting reconciliation and restoring stability. \nThe international financial crisis is another example. It is not an inevitable outcome of economic globalization; rather, it is the consequence of excessive chase of profit by financial capital and grave failure of financial regulation. Just blaming economic globalization for the world's problems is inconsistent with reality, and it will not help solve the problems.\n\nMake peace, restore stability, and no more refugee problem? It's so simple! Why didn't anyone think of that before now? \n\nChina loves hectoring Europe and the United States about the refugee crisis while doing very, very little to help with the problem. No Chinese leader is ever going to allow a migration that would threaten national security and social order. \n\nAs for the international financial crisis, it was the result of bad regulation, not the absence of regulation, and many of the heavy regulations imposed in its wake have been bad news. It is no surprise to see a Chinese head of state singing the praises of authoritarian control and calling for more \"global economic governance,\" but China really doesn't have anything to boast about at the moment.\n\nEven the much-quoted line from Xi about \"locking oneself in a dark room\" is a facile straw-man argument, pleasing to the globalist crowd because they don't want to engage with serious, measured criticism of their agenda. There is no serious movement to \"cut off the flow of capital, technologies, products, industries, and people between economies\" as Xi denounced in his speech, comparing that approach to forcing ocean waters back into \"isolated lakes and creeks.\" \n\nWhen Xi endorses developing a \"model of fair and equitable governance in keeping with the trend of the times,\" he's not talking about China becoming more like the free societies of the West. He is confident the reverse will occur, and can take some encouragement from Western elites flirting with speech and political controls similar to what China has. The Chinese government has been making war against \"fake news\" for a long time, and doesn't just quietly banish disfavored websites from social media engines.\n\nWhen he rails against 'income inequality,\" he is attacking capitalism, not the lavish lifestyles of Party mandarins. Some of the people applauding him in Davos are interested in banning cash money across the Western world, so that \"corruption\" can be more easily investigated \u2013 precisely the justification Beijing invokes for its chronic political purges.\n\nThis is not to condemn everyone in Davos, or everyone that fancies\u00a0themselves a \"globalist,\" as aspiring dictators \u2013 although the American Left's weird romance with Chinese authoritarianism throughout the Obama years should not be forgotten (that ideological virus has infected Canada, too.) It's just that voters across the Western world have grown weary of the unjustified arrogance of global elites, and that opinion is not likely to be improved by the spectacle of World Economic Forum attendees swooning before the president of China.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.53497314453125, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1244, "FairnessVirtue": 4, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 11, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.7768323777900004, "HarmVirtue": 11, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 4, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 45, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170117230000, "FairnessVice": 2, "pct_mft_words": 3.6173633440514505, "mft_mean": 4.090909090909999}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/12/10/turkey-imams-allegedly-spying-germany-erdogan/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [307, 323, 1132, 1707, 1715, 1842, 1850, 2224, 2341, 2349, 2431, 2761, 2888, 2922, 2937, 3079, 3269]}}, "headline": "German Lawmakers Call for Probe on Imams Suspected of Spying for Turkey", "wordcount_as_scraped": 540, "date": "20161210120000", "story_content": "German lawmakers have called for an investigation of Turkish intelligence operations in their country, specifically charging that Turkey is spying on suspected followers of exiled cleric and accused coup mastermind Fethullah Gulen.\n\nThe\u00a0Financial Times\u00a0sees this new controversy stacking with a recent German government report about Islamist radicalism in Ankara to create big problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is fighting to defend the EU-Turkey refugee pact.

They keep me at the door for about 5 minutes and then they ask me to leave,\" she told the outlet.\n\nThe Holt family lost its final opportunity to see Venezuela\u2019s socialist prison system free their son and daughter-in-law on December 7\u00a0when the government had scheduled a hearing on Holt\u2019s case. For the fourth time,\u00a0Judge Elena Cassiani was absent from the proceedings, making it impossible for the court to hear the case. The court rescheduled for January 5 but has since not allowed Prieto to meet with her clients, leaving her ill-equipped to represent them at that hearing.\n\nProsecutors\u00a0are seeking charges against Holt and Cale\u00f1o for terrorism and illegal possession of arms after a raid in which police claim to have found heavy weapons in Cale\u00f1o\u2019s apartment, an allegation the Holt family insists is impossible, and witnesses to the raid corroborate, accusing police of planting the evidence.\n\nHolt, a Utah native, had traveled to Venezuela to meet and marry Cale\u00f1o, whom he fell in love with after meeting online. His arrest followed the news of Venezuela\u2019s ally Iran releasing several U.S. citizens arrested on numerous suspect charges; in August,\u00a0news outlets reported that those American citizens were released in exchange for a large sum payment to the Iranian government \u2014 a deal opponents branded a \u201cransom.\u201d Iran has since apprehended another American citizen, perhaps waiting for a new deal with the White House.\n\nOn a page set up to bring awareness to the case, the Holt family wrote Thursday that they still harbor hope the Venezuelan government will set their son free: \u201cWe will NOT give up this fight, we will NOT forget them and we will continue to keep going until they\u2019re home where they\u2019re supposed to be.\u201d\n\n\n\nLast time Prieto was allowed to meet with Holt, she said fellow prisoners told her that guards were torturing him and that he had lost 50 pounds in prison. Other prisoners had reportedly seen guards force Holt to strip naked and perform \u201ccalisthenics,\u201d which Prieto noted was a violation of Holt\u2019s religious rights. As a practicing Mormon, Holt\u2019s religion does not permit him to remove religious undergarments in front of strangers. \u201cAs an LDS person, to make him do that is degrading,\u201d Prieto told the Associated Press. \u201cThis violates all conventions of prisoner treatment internationally.\u201d\n\nLaurie Holt, Joshua Holt's mother, added that she had heard from prison officials that Holt was additionally suffering from\u00a0\"pneumonia, bronchitis and a blood infection.\u201d Less is known about Thamara Cale\u00f1o\u2019s condition, though Laurie Holt told the\u00a0Idaho State Journal\u00a0in November that her daughter-in-law suffered from a torn rotator cuff.\n\nIn their update this week, Fox News notes that the House of Representatives has passed a resolution calling for Holt to return home\u00a0and that\u00a0Secretary of State John Kerry reportedly mentioned Holt to socialist Venezuelan dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro during a visit to Latin America.

The Lone Star State has taken President Barack Obama to court over 45 times since he became president in 2009 and have fought for state sovereignty and against federal overreach when he has issued executive orders and federal policies.\n\nGovernor Greg Abbott, formerly the Texas Attorney General, and the current AG, Ken Paxton, take great pride in saying how many times they have sued the president and his administration, and Texas has frequently been joined by a coalition of states once it has filed suit.\n\nWhen then-AG Greg Abbott was running for governor, he would frequently proudly tout that he had sued President Obama 31 times. He successfully fought to defend a monument to the Ten Commandments on the Texas Capitol grounds in Austin. He also led a coalition of all 50 states in defending the use of the words, \u201cOne Nation, Under God,\u201d in our Pledge of Allegiance, and in defending the right to pray during the Presidential Inauguration ceremony.\n\nAbbott also says he has saved jobs for Texans by fighting for our sovereignty against the \u201coverreaching and unlawful regulations that the EPA has attempted to impose upon Texas.\u201d He says the regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency have killed jobs by burdening employers financially.\n\nProbably the state\u2019s most famous case against the federal government, in particular U.S. Department of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, ended successfully when Texas led a coalition of 26 states against Obama\u2019s November 2014 executive amnesty order. The case originally filed by Greg Abbott, was argued in the U.S. Supreme Court by the Office of Texas AG Ken Paxton.\n\nAs reported by Breitbart Texas in June, the nation's highest court left in place a block of President Obama's unlawful executive amnesty dictate. The eight-member court has a vacancy left by the death of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. On that date, the Court stalled the federal government's executive amnesty order with a 4-4 vote. The tied decision in United States v. Texas, et al. left in place the lower court decision.\n\nThe Fifth Circuit issued a ruling in November 2015\u00a0effectively putting the brakes on\u00a0President Obama's November 2014 executive amnesty order, as reported\u00a0by Breitbart Texas.\u00a0The Fifth Circuit ruled that the lower federal district court did not err in granting a\u00a0halt to Obama's executive amnesty program. U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen previously issued the order\u00a0stopping the president's actions, as\u00a0reported\u00a0by Breitbart Texas.\n\nPresident Obama used executive action to dictate that the DAPA program (Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents) be implemented. Then-Attorney General Greg Abbott (now Texas Governor) filed suit challenging the executive order and led a coalition of 26 states to fight the effort. The case involved the issues of the proper scope of presidential power to bypass Congress, the Immigration and Nationality Act passed by Congress, and violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and other federal laws.\n\nAs\u00a0noted\u00a0by Breitbart News, the Court declined to rule on the notice-and-comment provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The APA requires a time period for notice to and comment from the public before issuing rules that create public policy mirroring law. A ruling that the federal government violated the provisions would have provided for transparency and government accountability, he wrote.\n\nWhen the U.S. Supreme Court denied President Obama\u2019s request to rehear the executive amnesty case, Texas AG Paxton said,\u00a0\"The State of Texas' position has been validated by the U.S. Supreme Court today as they denied the Obama administration's petition to rehear the immigration case. Rewriting national immigration law requires the full and careful consideration of Congress. This is the latest setback to the president's attempt to expand executive power and another victory for those who believe in the Constitution's separation of powers and the rule of law.\" As reported by Breitbart Texas, the parties in the litigation have agreed to a stay until exactly one month after President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in.\n\nTexas has also successfully helped defend Voter ID laws when the U.S. Department of Justice was fighting to stop the implementation of these laws. Then AG Greg Abbott filed an amicus or friend of the court brief in the U.S. Supreme Court in\u00a0Shelby County, Alabama v. Eric Holder. In the summer of 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court held in\u00a0Shelby County\u00a0that Section 4\u2019s provision that subjected Texas to preclearance by the Justice Department was unconstitutional.\u00a0This U.S. Supreme Court decision also settled a fight by Texas over its redistricting plan. Texas and other states were freed from the preclearance and federal approval requirements. Texas also fought a challenge to Texas Voter ID law SB 14 this year and have had more redistricting battles.\n\nTexas has defended HB 2, the state\u2019s abortion law, on a challenge that it unconstitutionally limited access to abortion in the state. Although the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the abortion law, the reaction by Texas leaders to the ruling was strong and swift, as reported by Breitbart Texas.\n\nPresident Obama has used executive power and federal regulation to do what Congress in their power should do. He has tested the separation of powers doctrine beyond that of other U.S. presidents, and these cases\u00a0are just some of the examples of where Texas has fought for our state sovereignty when the federal government has aggressively disregarded the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nWe lost our battle in the U.S. Supreme Court in the fight against Obamacare in 2012 and against Syrian Refugee Resettlement, and Obama\u2019s transferring the Internet to global interests this year when Congress failed to act, but we are grateful that it was challenged. The state was forced to dismiss a lawsuit filed by AG Paxton involving medical leave benefits for same-sex couples after the Supreme Court issued its opinion in the same-sex marriage case in June of 2015. Paxton issued an AG Opinion after the ruling which he said was designed to protect the religious liberties of county clerks and public officials in the state.\n\nOur Texas attorney generals have been committed to the fight, and the Texas AG will continue to do so, and for that we are very grateful.\n\nGovernor Greg Abbott responded to a January 2016 article by\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0titled, \u201cObama plans curbs on guns,\u201d by tweeting the article and saying, \u201cCOME AND TAKE IT.\u201d His tweet went viral as reported by Breitbart Texas but Texans also knew he meant it.\n\nAs reported by Breitbart Texas, Attorney General Paxton is still battling the federal government\u2019s directive in May 2016 that public schools implement its gender fluid transgender bathroom and locker room policies and allow children who are identifying with the opposite sex to use the facility they identify with that day. Paxton has been successful in obtaining a preliminary injunction against the Obama directive which applies nationwide.\n\nAs recently as this week as reported by Breitbart Texas, a Texas federal judge blocked a new overtime rule from the U.S. Department of Labor, championed by President Obama, from taking effect nationwide on December 1.\n\nLana Shadwick\u00a0is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

By December 8th, we had become revolutionized and revitalized as a young and vibrant country, with a national mission that later translated into the mission to defeat Soviet Communism. But first, we had to the Empire of Japan and Nazi Germany.\"\n\nLISTEN:\n\n\n\n\"It's really quite remarkable. You know, you think about all the things \u2013 whether the space program, or John Kennedy's presidency, or Ronald Reagan's presidency, or Dwight Eisenhower's presidency \u2013 all of them stem directly from Pearl Harbor,\" he mused. \"Had Pearl Harbor not existed, these men would not have been President of the United States. We might never have landed on the moon. There would be no United Nations. There would be no internationalism or neoconservatism, or Bush, or any of those other things which all have, in some way, derived their policies and their programs from December 7th and the aftermath of December 7th. So it is the pick-lock of history.\"\n\nShirley set the stage for the attack by noting \"there had been, historically, a good, warm relationship between Japan and the United States.\"\n\n\"Japan had been a closed society for three decades, until Matthew Perry, Admiral Perry, sailed into Tokyo Harbor in the 1850s and began an open-door \u2013 not the open-door policy, but an open-door policy. From that time forward, there had been strong trade relations, strong cultural relations, strong educational relations between Japan and the United States,\" he recalled. \"They were our ally in World War I. They were on our side against the Germans. When the end of the Sino-Japanese War took place in 1905, President Roosevelt, Teddy Roosevelt, negotiated the peace talks, for which he won the Nobel Peace Prize, and the Japanese felt that Roosevelt had bent over backwards to see their point of view in the war, so they always had warm affection for Teddy Roosevelt, and hence the United States.\"\n\n\"We began to diverge after World War I,\" he continued. \"A shogunate culture, a very militaristic, macho shogunate culture begins to take root in Japan, and they start to build up their war machine. They almost revert back to the Dark Ages in many ways: Women don't have rights. It's a manly culture. It's a macho culture. It's a very bullish, arrogant culture.\"\n\n\"We also passed laws restricting Asiatic immigration into the United States, and then we passed restrictive trade bills, and then we passed the Neutrality Acts of the 1930s,\" Shirley added. \"So by the 1930s, we're barely talking to each other, and it's not very warmly. And, of course, Japan, to feed its expansionist military, needs natural resources, and we're an impediment to that. Our fleet in the Pacific is an impediment to their expansionist policies.\" \n\n\"So there's only one solution, which is one massive stroke to decapitate all the British and American military presence in the central and western Pacific, and that's what they did on December 7, 1941,\" he said.\n\nHe described that day as a typical Sunday morning. \"Some people are going to church. Some people are sleeping off hangovers. One guy I knew was on the deck of the Nevada. He's a Navy seaman. He was on KP duty and was peeling potatoes, when all of a sudden, 150 Japanese airplanes drop out of the sky with what they referred to as the 'giant meatball' on the side, the big red painting on the side of the planes. He has nothing in his hands except for potatoes, and as these planes are whizzing by, he's throwing potatoes at these Japanese bombers and fighters, trying to do something, trying to do some sort of damage.\"\n\n\"We were completely unprepared. We were completely asleep. No anti-aircraft fire, no guns, no ship movement, no nothing. We were just completely naked in the morning sun, left exposed to be decimated by the Japanese,\" Shirley said.\n\nHe noted that communications in 1941 were not what they are today, but people still found out about it within minutes, \"either through the radio broadcasts or later through newspapers that were rushed out a couple of hours after the attack, very thin newspapers that announced the attack.\"\n\n\"They found out gossiping over the fence with their neighbors or in church: 'Did you hear about the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor?' So everybody was pretty much up to speed,\" he said. \"They didn't have the details. A lot of rumors took hold, and a lot of things people got wrong, but they understood that Japan had attacked America at Pearl Harbor. That they understood. And America's resolve changed instantly. We changed instantly from an isolationist country to an internationalist country, at least in terms of going to war with Japan.\"\n\n\"There's no resistance whatsoever. There's no pacifists. There's no leftists. There's not one editorial, not one columnist, only one member of Congress \u2013 Jeannette Rankin, a Republican from Montana \u2013 votes against our entry into the Pacific war. It passed the House with just her, overwhelmingly obviously, and it passes the Senate 83 to nothing, with no objections whatsoever. Within only several hours after Roosevelt asked Congress for a declaration of war does he get one, and he signs it, and he says, 'This is it,' and he realizes now the United States is plunging into a war that they desperately wanted to avoid,\" Shirley said.\n\n\"Everything changes in America,\" he said. \"We stop announcing ship movements and troop movements. We get used to blackouts. We get used to roadblocks. Japanese nationals begin to be rounded up. All reserves are canceled. Everybody's to go back into their uniform, which they'd been wearing civvies most of the time. Gas rationing starts to take hold quickly, food rationing, sugar rationing, coffee rationing. Scrap metal drives, paper drives, rubber drives all take place very, very quickly after December 7th, and the nation is transformed within a matter of days and weeks after December 7th.\" \n\n\"The arsenal of democracy is such that within three weeks of December 7th, Ford Motor Company, along with Fisher Auto Body and Goodyear Tire, stops producing cars \u2013 which by the way, Washington told people are complaining about Trump manipulating businesses. FDR manipulated and directed every business in America for four years,\" he observed. \"Washington told Detroit, 'You are no longer to build new cars,' and Detroit said okay. So Detroit starts churning out fabricated B-24 and B-25 bombers made out of the parts of new cars that were going to be made.\" \n\n\"Kelvinator in Chicago, which made coffee pots and things like that \u2013 everybody. Children became part of the war effort, with victory gardens and scrap drives, and old people by saving grease, which was used for the treads on tanks. Everybody contributed in some way, shape, or form to the war effort,\" Shirley said.\n\nHe called World War II \"the most democratic war that you could imagine\" because of the way it unified the country and involved people from every walk of life.\n\n\"In Vietnam, there was the college deferment. In the Civil War, you could buy your way out of service. But for World War II, everybody of draftable age was drafted. Those who weren't, tried to enlist. And if they didn't enlist and they weren't drafted, then they found some other way to serve their country,\" he observed.\n\nShirley said it was interesting to recall that \"Churchill had been lobbying FDR for months\" to support Britain, which he accurately presented as the \"last line of defense against Nazism,\" but \"there was no will in this country for getting involved in another European war after World War I.\"\n\n\"Even after the attack, there's no linkage whatsoever between the attack at Pearl Harbor and our getting into the European war. The reason we get into the European war is four days after the attack, Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini declare war on the United States because of the Tripartite Pact with Japan, which was a mutual defense agreement,\" he pointed out. \"So, therefore, we have to respond, so we declare war on Germany and Italy. But there's no evidence whatsoever that would have gotten involved in the European war after Pearl Harbor, until Hitler and Italy declare war on the United States.\"\n\nThe war America fought with Japan was exceptionally long and brutal, for as Shirley explained, Japanese military culture held it \"better to die\" than be taken captive.\n\n\"The Japanese soldier fought tenaciously and to the very death because they actually preferred death to being taken hostage or being taken prisoner, so it was a long slog over all these tiny atolls and islands, over three, four thousand miles across the Pacific, to invade them and to eradicate them. Guadalcanal was the tail of a bloody, bloody conflict which took months, and many, many American lives were lost,\" he said. \n\n\"And we haven't even mentioned the wounded,\" Shirley added. \"We lost in World War II something like 275,000 men, I believe, but it was well over a million wounded men [who] lost limbs, lost arms, lost their eyesight, lost their hearing \u2013 in some way, shape, or form were somehow badly damaged by the war effort. The casualties were exceedingly high in some instances, like Anzio in Europe.\"\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\u00a0to 9:00 a.m.\u00a0Eastern.\n\nListen to the complete audio of the interview above.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 21, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.36341905593872, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1485, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 37, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 11.349445684900001, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 37, "mft_sum": 67, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 2, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161207210000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.51178451178451, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 6.090909090909999}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/12/09/lawyer-strike-delays-pakistan-kim-kardashian-honor-killing/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [389, 394, 958, 1153, 1316, 1685, 1895, 2015, 2695, 3221, 4060, 4229]}}, "headline": "Lawyer Strike Delays \u2018Pakistan\u2019s Kim Kardashian\u2019 Honor Killing Case", "wordcount_as_scraped": 701, "date": "20161210070000", "story_content": "The case of the honor killing of Qandeel Baloch, a model and outspoken feminist who became known as \u201cPakistan\u2019s Kim Kardashian\u201d before her brother strangled her to death at age 26, will once again have to wait, as regional lawyers are on strike in a nation in which their trade is often dangerous.\n\nThe Pakistani newspaper\u00a0Dawn\u00a0reports that lawyers in Multan have gone on strike, leaving no one to argue the honor killing case for either side. Baloch\u2019s brother Waseem confessed to killing his sister in July, despite her status as the only member of the family to generate money, because she had posted suggestive photos of herself online and criticized a well-connected Islamic cleric.\n\nBaloch\u2019s sister and cousin were also arrested in the case, and her mother is seeking to have the cleric, Mufti Abdul Qavi, charged with conspiracy in the case of her daughter\u2019s murder.\n\nDawn reports that\u00a0the court has yet to schedule a new date for the trial and failed to be able to process the case as \u201csix police witnesses were not able to record their statements because of the lawyers strike,\u201d\u00a0according to a local official.\n\nPakistan\u2019s attorneys, particularly those involved in prosecuting cases of honor killing and Islam-motivated violence, often become\u00a0the target of such violence themselves. In August, lawyers in Multan went on strike to protest the government\u2019s inaction in the face of this violence. \u201cAddressing a meeting, Multan High Court Bar Association president Sheikh Jamshed Hayat said that there was no security for the legal fraternity, particularly in the restive areas like Balochistan,\u201d reports Pakistan\u2019s\u00a0The News.\n\nThat strike appears to have been triggered by a suicide bombing targeting lawyers in Quetta, the regional capital of Balochistan, that month. Over 70 individuals were killed in that attack, at least\u00a060 of them lawyers, according to tallies at the time. The bomb targeted an assembly at a hospital to mourn the death of\u00a0Bilal Anwar Kasi, the head of Balochistan\u2019s Bar Association, who had been assassinated that same day.\n\nFour months later, Al Jazeera reports that the death count was closer to 70 lawyers, and Balochistan\u2019s legal system is in ruins. \u201cThe blast has set back Balochistan by 100 years,\u201dAtta Khan Kakar, Kasi\u2019s brother and fellow attorney, told Al Jazeera. \u201cLawyers with decades of experience, people who would become judges, were all killed. We are a target because we stand to provide justice.\u201d\n\nThe Taliban and the Islamic State both took credit for the suicide bombing.\n\nSuch attacks have made it far more difficult for relatives of victims of honor killings or Muslim mob attacks\u00a0to receive justice. In the case of Qandeel Baloch, her family must now wait indefinitely for their day in court.\n\nBaloch rose to internet prominence by posting suggestive images of herself on social media in defiance of traditional Islamic gender norms, which were received with anger in Pakistan and curiosity internationally. In 2016, however, she began to post increasing political and feminist statements on Facebook, decrying the oppression of women in her country. By the time of her final interview, with the newspaper\u00a0Dawn, Baloch had condemned her family for forcing her to marry an abusive man who had repeatedly threatened to burn her face to prevent her from showing it off.\n\nBut before that interview, she met Qavi in a hotel room and took some selfies with him, which she posted online. Following their meeting, Baloch accused Qavi of making sexually suggestive comments to her and drinking soda, a violation of his responsibility to fast during Ramadan. Qavi was demoted from his political position and, according to Baloch\u2019s mother, encouraged her siblings to kill her in revenge.\n\nBaloch had appealed to Pakistani law enforcement for protection after her meeting with Qavi, stating online that she had received death threats.\n\n\"I am proud of what I did. I drugged her first, then I killed her,\" Waseem Baloch said shortly after killing his sister.\u00a0\"Girls are born to stay home and follow traditions. My sister never did that.\"\n\n\"I planned this after her scandal with the mufti and was waiting for the right time,\" he\u00a0admitted.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.56756734848022, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 681, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 17, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.9560047892500005, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 41, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161210070000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 6.02055800293686, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.72727272727}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/01/24/rep-chris-collins-schools-cnns-wolf-blitzer-business-investments/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [6330, 7114]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1047, "scraper_regex": 1133}}, "headline": "Rep.

Chris Collins (R-NY) schooled CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on ethical standards in business investment late Monday.\n\nAppearing on Blitzer\u2019s The Situation Room, Collins easily turned the tables on Blitzer, who was attempting to advance Sen. Patty Murray\u2019s (D-WA) unsubstantiated claim, made last week at Rep. Tom Price\u2019s confirmation hearings to become Secretary of Health and Human Services, that the Secretary-designate\u2019s investment in an Australian company called Innate Immunotherapeutics constituted \u201cinsider trading.\u201d\n\nThe second round of confirmation hearings on Price\u2019s nomination to head HHS will be held by the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cDid you encourage him [Rep. Price] to buy stock in this company called Innate Immunotherapeutics?\u201d Blitzer asked.\n\n\u201cNo, absolutely not, there was nothing done that was insider trading or unethical,\u201d Collins responded.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been involved with Innate Immunotherapeutics in New Zealand and Australia for almost fifteen years. I\u2019m the largest shareholder and I talk about it all the time, just like you would talk about your children,\u201d Collins said, adding:\n\nWe\u2019re bringing to market at some point the only drug that could treat secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, the most debilitating disease there is with no treatment today.\nIt is probably what I am most proud of.\nI talk about it at breakfast lunch and dinner like I do my kids and my wife. Certainly many folks I\u2019ve talked [to] about it.\nHe was one of the few who, because it\u2019s a public company in Australia, researched it, liked what he saw, and decided on his own to make an investment.\n\nCollins serves on the Board of Directors of Innate Immunotherapeutics, and has a long business history as an executive and investor in similar early stage companies.\n\nCollins owns 17 percent of the company, which has never made a profit, according to its 2016 annual report.\n\nThe price of the company\u2019s stock has declined from 25 cents per share (in Australian dollars) in 2014 to 18 cents per share in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe Company has designed and manufactured a unique immunomodulator microparticle technology,\u201d according to its website:\n\nThis technology can be used to induce the human immune system to fight certain cancers and infections, or modulate certain immune mechanisms implicated in autoimmune diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis. The same technology can be used in the design of better vaccines to potentially treat or prevent diseases such as influenza, cancer, malaria, or tuberculosis.\n\nThe company has spent years developing drugs based on its unique technology, and is still in the testing phases with its first drug, which it hopes to bring to market soon.\n\n\u201cThe first drug candidate developed using this technology, MIS416, combines two well described immunostimulatory ligands or triggers \u2013 NOD2 & TLR9. MIS416, has demonstrated safety and efficacy in a number of different disease or injury models,\u201d it says:\n\nDue to the significant degree of unmet medical need, Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis has been selected as the initial clinical target for MIS416.\nA Phase 1B human study in patients with primary progressive or secondary progressive MS (SPMS) was completed in October 2011 and a follow on \u2018dose confirmation\u2019 Phase 2A study in patients with secondary progressive MS was completed in July 2012. The results from these studies met or exceeded expectations and the Company is now conducting a larger-longer Phase 2B trial in patients with SPMS. This study commenced in Australia in late 2014.\n\nBlitzer persisted in his questioning of Collins.\n\n\u201cDid he [Rep. Price] buy the stock at what was available to everybody or did he get special access discount? \u201d he asked of Collins.\n\n\u201cThat was the allegation heard during the committee hearing,\u201d Blitzer said.\n\nCollins then explained that Price participated in stock purchases in the same way everyone else did.\n\n\u201cBecause the stock was offered to every shareholder at a ten percent discount of the average closing price of the prior thirty days, that\u2019s what you do with a major fundrasing round. It was made to every shareholder in Australia and New Zealand; 600 out of 850 took advantage of that, he said.\n\n\u201cBut was he a shareholder eligible for that kind of ten percent discount?\u201d Blitzer asked.\n\n\u201cWe also did a private placement that was open to current US shareholders and new investors. He was a new investor. Several joined in,\u201d Collins said.\n\nInnate Immunotherapeutics is publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange, but it is not a public company traded in any American stock exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ.\n\nAmericans can purchase public stock in the company in transactions in the Australian Securities Exchange.\n\nIn the major fundraising round for the company mentioned by Collins, the company was able to make a public offer to those Australian and New Zealand shareholders, but because of American securities laws, it could not use that same investment vehicle to Americans.\n\nCompanies that are not publicly traded on American stock exchanges can raise money from American citizens, but must do so under strict rules imposed at both the federal and state level.\n\nThose investments are called \u201cprivate placements\u201d and, by law, only \u201cqualified investors\u201d are allowed to participate as investors. Typically, a \u201cqualified investor\u201d must meet a certain standard of net worth, in most cases around $500,000.\n\nIn a private place memorandum offered to potential investors, the company raising the funds must disclose its financial performance to date as well as the risks associated with the investment.\n\nIn his interview with Blitzer, Collins clearly explained that Rep. Price\u2019s purchases of stock in Innate Immunotherapeutics was made at the same price point that was available to other Americans.\n\nThough CNN typically posts video of Blitzer\u2019s The Situation Room interviews along with stories that appear on the network\u2019s website based on those interviews, it did not follow that pattern in the case of Monday\u2019s interview of Collins.\n\nInstead, the accompanying video was a clip of Sen. Patty Murray\u2019s questioning of Rep. Price at his first round of confirmation hearings last week before the Senate Committee on \u00a0Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s second round of confirmation hearings, Democratic senators are again expected to attempt to claim that Price engaged in insider trading.\n\nIf those hearings are anything like the earlier hearings, you can expect the Democrat senators to accuse Price of misconduct rather than question him, then interrupt him as he delivers his responses.\n\nAnother line of attack on Price \u2013 that an investment in a company called Zimmer Biomet \u2013 may have constituted a violation of the STOCK Act of 2012, launched at those confirmation hearings also failed, despite CNN\u2019s best efforts to promote it.\n\nLate Monday, CNN published another story that criticized Price, noting, among other things, that he had been late in paying $1,600 in taxes once.\n\n\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.3973798751831101, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1047, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 4, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.67134330099, "HarmVirtue": 4, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 4, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170124160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.5281757402101201, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/01/09/cuba-confiscates-toys-christians-looking-celebrate-three-kings-day/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00f1": [1800], "\u00a0": [113, 346, 729, 1077, 1129, 2505, 3409, 3507], "\u00fa": [3591], "\u00ed": [134, 367, 702, 773]}}, "headline": "Cuba Confiscates Toys from Christians Looking to Celebrate Feast of Epiphany", "wordcount_as_scraped": 590, "date": "20170110030000", "story_content": "Cuban police stormed into the home of\u00a0Leticia Ramos Herrer\u00eda, a member of the Ladies in White dissident group, and confiscated toys the group had collected to distribute in celebration of the Christian feast day of Epiphany.\n\n\u201cPolice executed an operation at the home of\u00a0Leticia Ramos Herrer\u00eda without her being present and took all the toys away that she had bought to distribute to more than 200 children this Three Kings\u2019 Day,\u201d according to Cuba\u2019s dissident leader Martha Beatriz Roque, using another name common for the holiday.\n\n\u201cThey took everything,\u201d Berta Soler, the head of the Ladies in White group, lamented to Mart\u00ed Noticias. The Spain-based\u00a0Diario de Cuba adds that two of Ramo Herrer\u00eda\u2019s relatives, her son and brother, were beaten during the siege on her home.\n\nWhile Epiphany is a pan-Christian holiday, Latin American Catholics and Spaniards hold special celebrations on January 6, the twelfth day of Christmas. The celebration is intended to observe the arrival of the Three Wise Men\u00a0to Bethlehem, where Jesus was born. As the wise men\u00a0brought gifts with them to the manger, it is traditional to give children toys as presents on this day.\n\nThe Ladies in White are a group of mothers, daughters, sisters, and wives of Cuban prisoners of conscience. They are a Catholic group, and their main act of protest is to attend Catholic Mass on Sundays dressed in white, then silently march home holding photos of their loved ones, imprisoned for their opposition to Communism. They are not alone in openly celebrating Epiphany as a symbolic protest \u2014 the family of Danilo Maldonado Machado, an artist known more commonly as \u201cEl Sexto,\u201d organized a party for local Havana children on Friday and shared cake and a pi\u00f1ata with them.\n\nMaldonado was arrested in November for publicly celebrating the death of dictator Fidel Castro on the streets of Havana. His mother says Cuban police have assaulted him on multiple occasions while in custody, denying him medication to control his asthma. Maldonado was moved to a maximum security prison after repeatedly shouting, \u201cdown with Castro,\u201d from his prison cell. He has yet to be charged with a crime.\n\nAs with most Catholic holidays, the Cuban Communist Party did away with Three Kings\u2019 Day early in its half-century tenure. According to the Diario de Cuba, the Castro regime only reinstated a version of Three Kings\u2019 Day in the 1990s: Children\u2019s Day, a secular holiday in July\u00a0meant to combat the influence of a resurgence in Christmas celebrations organized by the Spanish embassy in the country.\n\nPrivate acts of Christian celebration are still subject to censure, however, as in the case of the Ladies in White toy drive. In another instance of Christian oppression, a 70-year-old Cuban-American man was arrested in 2015 for organizing an inflatable Santa Claus display in Havana.\n\nJanuary 6 continues to be a day of celebration, however, and parents do attempt to purchase toys to give their children. Cuba boasts few toy stores, however, with limited supplies at exorbitant prices. An employee of one Cuban toy store estimated to Cubanet that toy prices typically triple shortly before the holiday.\n\nWhile many dissidents adhere to the Christian faith, the Vatican has largely done little to aid their work to liberate the island.

But this year, most of the state saw almost that much precipitation in January.\n\nAt Mammoth Mountain's Main Lodge at an altitude of 8,909 feet in the Sierra's, the recent storms brought 35 inches\u00a0of new snow in a five-day period. By the time the weather cleared, annual snowfall at America's most popular ski area stood at 350 inches and the current snow pack stands at 180 inches.\n\nWith Shasta Lake in Northern California filling at a rate of\u00a057,000 cubic feet per second, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation on January 12 opened all 5 of the huge drain pipes on the face of the 521-foot-high Shasta Dam for the first time in six years. But at a maximum discharge rate of 36,000 cubic feet per second, some local authorities feared the risk of uncontrolled flooding if the lake continued to rise and go over the spillway at the top of the dam.\n\nCalifornia's 12 major reservoirs due to runoff are now at about 120 percent of their historical average levels and most are discharging higher water flows. The San Joaquin River is currently pouring into California's Delta at a rate of 20,000 cubic feet per second. At its peak last year, the river was only flowing at about 4,000 cubic feet per second.\n\nThe\u00a0U.S. Interior Department's Bureau of Reclamation has been offering $1.1 billion to raise the height of Shasta Dam by\u00a018.5 feet\u00a0to increase water storage by 14 percent. But the Obama Administration killed the project in 2014 by filing a 349-page report claiming any expansion would threaten salmon under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nBut Obama's outgoing Interior Secretary Sally Jewell did issue a Secretarial Order on January 4 directing the Bureau of Reclamation and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \"to allocate available resources\" to complete Governor Jerry Brown's $15 billion twin tunnels under the Delta as part of his California WaterFix.\n\nInterior Secretary Nominee Ryan Zinke told a Senate confirmation hearing this week that \"our states, local governments, and Indian nations need a partner who can restore trust in Washington as a responsible steward of our federally owned lands.\"\n\nZinke pointed out that the federal government now owns an incredible\u00a020 percent of the land\u00a0in the United States after President Obama added\u00a029 new national monuments\u00a0and\u00a0553 million acres\u00a0of land and water across the U.S. to the jurisdiction of the Interior Department's National Parks system.\n\nAs part of Donald Trump's campaign promise to make America \"energy independent,\u201d his Administration is expected to open up drilling on federal lands after the Obama Administration cut the number of wells drilled on federal lands by 50 percent since 2008. Any big expansion of drilling is usually coupled to an expansion of water storage.\n\nThe current high-pressure ridge is expected to break up over the next six days and clear the way for more rains. The heaviest period of precipitation during California's annual water year is mid-January through late early April, so there is plenty of time for extreme flooding over the state's already soggy soil.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 10, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.6536312103271498, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 636, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.8719216361699997, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 10, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170128170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.51572327044025, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/11/22/nazi-salute-cnn-breitbart-news-white-supremacists-charles-kaiser-brooke-baldwin/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [125, 1013, 1142, 1157, 1817, 2089, 2445, 2608, 4803, 4816, 4937, 4964, 5492]}}, "headline": "CNN Falsely Claims Breitbart News \u2018Most Prominent Platform\u2019 for Nazi Salute and \u2018White Supremacists\u2019", "wordcount_as_scraped": 916, "date": "20161122230000", "story_content": "On Tuesday afternoon, CNN\u00a0showed a video of white supremacists giving the Nazi salute and called Breitbart News \u201cthe most prominent platform\u201d for the Nazi salute and for \u201cthe white supremacists in this country.\u201d\n\nIn the same segment, CNN contributor Charles Kaiser claimed falsely that Stephen K. Bannon is \u201ca man who uses the word nigger.\u201d\n\nBannon has never been accused of using that word before, nor is there any evidence that he has done so. The statement was, plainly, a lie.\n\nBannon is on leave as Executive Chairman of Breitbart News, and was recently appointed by President-elect Donald J. Trump as Chief Strategist and Senior Counselor.\n\nKaiser used the \u201cN-word\u201d itself on live television, in a debate with former White House official Paris Dennard, a Trump supporter who happens to be black, and took offense at the word. Kaiser cited no source for his claims.\n\nIndeed, according to the Washington Post,\u00a0Kaiser later apologized \u2014 it is not clear to whom \u2014 for misattributing the \u201cN-word\u201d to Bannon.\n\nLater in the CNN debate, Baldwin\u00a0asked Dennard:\u00a0\u201cBut what about Steve Bannon, Paris, to Charles\u2019s point, and Breitbart, the most prominent platform for what we just showed, you know, the video we just showed, the Nazi salute, the while supremacists in this country. Are you okay with having Steve Bannon as the chief strategist at the White House, Paris?\u201d\n\nBreitbart News has never showed the video of the Nazi salute, which ran at The Atlantic and other sites. Nor has Breitbart News ever associated with white supremacists. In fact, earlier on Tuesday, the Daily Beast had reported that Breitbart News had \u201cexcoriated\u201d a white nationalist who had reached out to the site.\n\nTrump had no reported connection\u00a0with the group in the video, and later disavowed its support explicitly.\n\nDespite her false claims linking Breitbart to the Nazi salute video and white supremacists, Baldwin appeared shocked by the language Kaiser had used on air.\n\nAfter Kaiser used the \u201cN-word,\u201d Baldwin\u00a0responded: \u201cCharles, hang on a second. I appreciate you going through all of this, but please don\u2019t use the \u2018N-word\u2019 on my show.\u201d\n\nKaiser replied: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, well, I never use the \u2018N-word\u2019 except when I\u2019m quoting someone who\u2019s been appointed by the president to serve in the Oval Office, and since this is such a disgusting moment in our history.\u201d Kaiser\u00a0cited no source for his claim, and Baldwin did not challenge him at that time.\n\nWhen Dennard had a turn to speak, Kaiser interrupted him repeatedly as he defended\u00a0Trump, Bannon, and Breitbart.\n\nAfter Dennard defended Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), whom Trump has selected to be Attorney General, Kaiser launched an explicitly racist attack.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s shameful any African-American would support this man to be Attorney General,\u201d Kaiser told Dennard.\n\nDennard replied: \u201cSir, you don\u2019t know why \u2014 you know what? I don\u2019t question your allegiance to the people you support. I will tell you why I support Mr. Trump, who\u2019s the President-elect, because I think he\u2019s going to do good things for this country and particularly good things for my community.\u201d\n\nAt that, Baldwin ended the debate \u2014 but offered a tearful conclusion, straight to camera:\n\n\u201cThe more I\u2019ve sat here and listened to the fact that somebody used the \u2018N-word\u2019 \u2013(sigh) it is not okay. It is not okay, Charles Kaiser. I respect you, I enjoy having you as a guest \u2014 but not okay. By the way, the claim that Mr. Bannon used the \u2018N-word,\u2019 I\u2019ve never heard of this, so there\u2019s that. Take a break.\u201d\n\nReached after the interview by Breitbart News, Dennard said: \u201cI was shocked, because I think the utilization of that word is highly offensive, even if you\u2019re allegedly quoting somebody else.\u201d\n\nDennard added: \u201cI appreciate the fact that Brooke immediately said that was inappropriate and should never be said on the show. She emailed me afterward and apologized.\u201d\n\nNo such apology was forthcoming to Breitbart News for the false claim that Breitbart is \u201cthe most prominent platform for what we just showed, you know, the video we just showed, the Nazi salute, the while supremacists in this country.\u201d\n\nOn Kaiser\u2019s racist comment towards him personally, Dennard said:\n\n\u201cI do not appreciate people who attack me for supporting Trump because I\u2019m African-American. Because the President-elect has never said anything disparaging about the black community. If anything, he has been championing the least of these, in our community, who need the most attention \u2014 those who are suffering economically, those who are suffering under failed education systems.\u201d\n\nAs Breitbart News has previously noted, neither Breitbart nor Bannon supports \u201cwhite nationalism.\u201d\n\nIn a recent interview with the Hollywood Reporter,\u00a0Bannon said:\u00a0\"I'm not a white nationalist, I'm a nationalist. I'm an economic nationalist.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Kimberly A. Strassel of the\u00a0Wall Street Journal quoted\u00a0Bannon in a recent interview:\n\nI'm an economic nationalist. I am an America first guy. And I have admired nationalist movements throughout the world, have said repeatedly strong nations make great neighbors. I've also said repeatedly that the ethno-nationalist movement, prominent in Europe, will change over time. I've never been a supporter of ethno-nationalism.\"\n\nYet CNN has persisted with its outrageously false claims, as it did again on Tuesday.\n\nJoel B.

through torture\" to justify recent mass executions, particularly the hanging of up to 25 Sunni men accused of terrorism in early August.\n\nIn a report\u00a0on Iran published Thursday, human rights organization Amnesty International, notes:\n\nWithin less than 24 hours after the 2 August mass execution, the Iranian authorities embarked on a media campaign, apparently to dehumanize the executed men and those on death row from the same group in the eyes of the public, to convince the public of their guilt and to justify their executions.\n\nAccording to the report, the videos features \"forced 'confessions' extracted through torture\" along with foreboding music and unrelated footage of terrorist attacks carried out by the Sunni jihadist group Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) in Iraq and Syria.\n\nAmnesty International reports:\n\nThese videos are interjected with clips showing IS [Islamic State] atrocities carried out in Syria and Iraq, which suggests an effort by the authorities to exploit Iranian people's fears about security threats elsewhere in the region to justify the men's executions.\nIn messages recorded from inside prison using a clandestine mobile phone, the executed men had said that they were forced to give \u201cconfessions\u201d corded on video after suffering months of torture in the Ministry of Intelligence detention centres where they were held in prolonged solitary confinement.\nCommon methods of torture they described included kicking, punching, beatings with electric batons, flogging, suspension, sleep deprivation and denial of access to food and medication.\n\nThe report cites the August 2 mass state-sanctioned execution of 25 Sunni men, including 22 from Iran's Kurdish minority.\n\nThey \"had been convicted on the vaguely worded charge of 'enmity against God' (moharebeh) in connection with a number of armed activities,\" points out the human rights watchdog group.\n\n\"The mass execution, which was carried out without prior notice to the men's families and lawyers and amid major fair trial concerns, sent shock waves across the media in Iran and throughout the world, and evoked widespread condemnation,\" it adds.\n\nAll 25 men were accused of carrying out terrorist attacks in Iran's western Kurdish region and hanged for it, marking \"one of the largest mass executions ever carried out\" in the Islamic Republic, reports the Independent.\n\nThe move not to notify the accused men's family and lawyers prompted condemnation from various human rights groups, including Amnesty International.\n\nAmnesty International has denounced what it has described as a new practice in Iran, the broadcasting of forced \"confessions,\" adding that they are being used to justify mass executions.\n\nThe footage, produced by and widely disseminated by Iranian state-controlled media, are reportedly intended to both justify the executions and exploit fears of Sunni terrorism in the Shiite-majority country, notes Amnesty International, adding that the media outlets have used sensationalist titles such as \"In the Depth of Darkness\" and \"In the Devil's Hands.\"\n\nHuman Rights Watch has also condemned the new trend.\n\n\"It seems Iran has joined the region's propaganda industry, producing slick videos featuring the apparently forced confessions of men they later executed as 'terrorists,'\" declared Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director of the watchdog organization, referring to the reports of the Islamic Republic broadcasting coerced confessions.\n\nLast year, there were nearly 1,000 state-sanctioned executions in Iran, marking the highest number in two decades, according to the United Nations.\n\nA report released on in late July by the Norway-based group Iran Human Rights [IHR],

(AP) \u2014 Snow and sleet pounded a large swath of the East Coast on Saturday, coating roads with ice and causing hundreds of crashes. Thousands of people lost power and forecasters warned of blizzard-like conditions from Virginia to parts of the Northeast.\n\nPolice investigated several fatal crashes as potentially storm-related, but some of the South\u2019s biggest cities \u2013 Atlanta, Charlotte and Raleigh \u2013 appeared to avoid the worst of the storm. Authorities praised residents for learning the lessons of past storms that resulted in icy gridlock, where thousands of people were stranded along the interstates. But officials warned that bitter cold would keep roads treacherous well after the snow and sleet stopped.\n\n\u201cIf I tell you anything it would be stay home,\u201d Gov. Roy Cooper said. \u201cDo not go out and drive on the roads unless you absolutely have to.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina cities Burlington, Greensboro and Roxboro received 8 inches or more of snow, and several inches fell in southeast Virginia, where a blizzard warning was issued for the cities along the coast.\n\nNorth Carolina reported more than 250 crashes, while Virginia had more than 100. Hundreds of crashes were reported in Tennessee starting Friday. Hundreds of flights were canceled, from Atlanta to airports farther north.\n\nAt least one fatality \u2013 a man whose pickup truck went off a snow-slickened Kentucky road Thursday \u2013 has been blamed on the weather. Motorist deaths in North Carolina and Maryland as the storm blew in were investigated to see if they were caused by the weather.\n\nPower outages had grown to about 25,000 in North Carolina alone, according to a news release from the governor. Nearly half were in the Charlotte area and adjacent Union County, according to Duke Power.\n\nIn Cornelius, north of Charlotte, Matt Thomas said he used a ruler to measure nearly 6 inches of snow and sleet that had piled up on the back of his pickup truck. He planned to spend the weekend enjoying the snow and watching television. A plow passed through his neighborhood, but the road still looked slippery.\n\n\u201cThe sleet started first, so there\u2019s definitely a layer of ice under the snow,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cI\u2019m staying home.\u201d\n\nThe unpredictable storm left some areas with much different outcomes than neighboring counties. Unofficial totals from the National Weather Service showed that much of Raleigh and Charlotte had 2 inches or less of precipitation \u2013 much of it sleet \u2013 while areas to the north of both cities got several inches of snow.\n\nIn Atlanta and parts of Georgia, people who were expecting a couple of inches of snow instead woke up to a thin coat of ice. Still, it didn\u2019t stop children from sliding down slick grassy hills in what is a once- or twice-a-year icy occurrence.\n\nSome took to social media to complain that they didn\u2019t have anything to sled in, prompting an apologetic Tweet from one well-known Raleigh weatherman.\n\n\u201cTo all my detractors, more than 24 hours ago I began talking about how this snow event could go up in smoke. I try to be honest-all I can do,\u201d WRAL-TV chief meteorologist Greg Fishel said early Saturday.\n\nA blizzard warning for southeast Virginia accompanied forecasts of high winds and up to 9 inches of snow there.

No other forces are known to be conducting drone strikes in the area.\"\n\nCiting Yemeni security and tribal officials who spoke on condition of anonymity, the Associated Press (AP) reveals that two U.S. drone strikes on Saturday took out al-Qaeda Yemen field commander Abu Anis al-Abi and two others.\n\nReporting from the Yemeni capital Sanaa, which has fallen under the control of Iran-allied Shiite Houthi rebels, NYT explains that the two airstrikes targeted the south-central Yemeni province of Bayda, killing \"10 militants with Al Qaeda, three of them hit while riding on a motorcycle and the other seven killed in a vehicle in a separate drone attack in the same area.\"\n\nOverall, renewed fighting in Yemen reportedly killed an estimated 75 people on Saturday and Sunday, including the 10 jihadists killed in the suspected U.S. drone strikes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Times notes:\n\nThe greatest loss of life in Yemen over the weekend was from an offensive begun two weeks ago on the Red Sea coast by the Saudi-led coalition fighting on behalf of the [internationally recognized] government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi\u2026 Airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition killed at least 52 Houthi fighters in [the Red Sea port city of] Mokha on Saturday and Sunday, according to Yemeni news reports, while the Houthis killed 14 of the Hadi government attackers.\"\n\nNYT acknowledges that casualty reports by both sides \u2014 the Saudi-led coalition and the Iran-allied Shiite Houthis \u2014 vary widely, adding that \"the true number of victims was impossible to verify, but it was clear that large numbers had been killed on both sides in the current offensive.\"\n\n#BREAKING Yemeni government forces seize Red Sea port of Mokha: AFP\n\u2014 AFP news agency (@AFP) January 23, 2017\n\n\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition in collaboration with forces loyal to the Yemeni president have reportedly seized back the port city Mokha, which the Times notes had been used to smuggle Iranian weapons destined for the Houthi rebels.\n\nThe Yemen-based al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), considered one of the most dangerous branches of the terrorist group, has largely benefited from the security and political chaos in Yemen, seizing large swathes of territory\u00a0and growing stronger than ever, as Shiite Houthis and armed groups loyal to the country's former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, fight against the U.S.-backed Saudi-led coalition and Hadi forces.\n\nThe al-Qaeda branch has tightened its grip on the southern and southeastern parts of the Arab country.\n\nAQAP capitalized on the Saudi-led coalition's primary focus on the Iran-allied Houthis. Meanwhile, al-Qaeda's rival the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) has also established a presence in Yemen.\n\nIn March 2015, deteriorating security conditions forced the U.S. to withdraw its military personnel out of Yemen as the Houthis, which controlled at least nine of the country's 21 provinces at the time, stepped up their offensive.\n\nThe U.S. insisted that it had retained its capabilities to conduct counterterrorism operations in Yemen even after evacuating its troops out of the country and closing its embassy there in March 2015.\n\nIt was not until May 2016 that a small contingent of U.S. forces returned to Yemen and began targeting the resurgent al-Qaeda jihadists once again.\n\nThe use of drone strikes in Yemen, the world\u2019s poorest country, dramatically increased under President Barack Obama\u2019s watch, particularly in 2012 and 2016, according to data from the Britain-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which notes that \u201cthere were ten times more\u00a0air strikes in the covert war on terror\u00a0during President Barack Obama's presidency than under his predecessor, George W. Bush.\u201d\n\n\u201cA total of 563\u00a0strikes, largely by drones, targeted Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen during\u00a0Obama's two terms, compared to 57 strikes under Bush. Between\u00a0384 and 807 civilians were killed in those countries,\u201d notes the bureau.\n\nIn its second public assessment issued in response to mounting pressure for more transparency about lethal U.S. operations overseas, Obama intelligence officials provided a much lower casualty count on Thursday, saying as many as 117 civilians had been killed in drone and other counter-terror attacks in Pakistan, Yemen, and elsewhere under the former president.\n\nPresident Trump has vowed to toughen American efforts against terrorist groups.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.50335550308228, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 663, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 19, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 5.176233034719999, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 19, "mft_sum": 38, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170124060000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.7315233785821995, "mft_mean": 3.45454545455}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2017/01/23/not-deterrent-says-south-texas-border-patrol-spokeswoman/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [2729, 3965, 4395, 4408, 5041, 5202]}}, "headline": "\u2018We\u2019re Not a Deterrent,\u2019 Says South Texas Border Patrol Spokeswoman", "wordcount_as_scraped": 797, "date": "20170123140000", "story_content": "The spokesperson for the U.S. Border Patrol's Rio Grande Valley Sector (RGV) told the Fox News Channel that her agents are not a deterrent to illegal border crossings in the current climate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not a deterrent because they\u2019re looking for us, so we can be standing there and [the smuggler will] still send them across,\u201d Supervisory Border Patrol Agent Marlene Castro told Fox News Channel's William La Jeunesse during a December interview. \u201cIt\u2019s been a group, and then maybe five minutes later another group, and then half an hour later you\u2019ll see another one.\u201d\n\nCastro is referring to the overwhelming numbers of illegal immigrants, Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC), and Family Unit Aliens (FMUA) who cross the border and search out the first law enforcement official they can find. December numbers from U.S. Customs and Border Protections officials released last week revealed the number of FMUA apprehensions along the entire southwestern U.S.-Mexico border increased for the sixth straight month. 16,135 FMUAs were apprehended along the southwest border during the month of December 2016. The year-to-date numbers of FMUA apprehensions are up by 109 percent over the previous fiscal year's apprehensions.\n\nThe numbers in Castro's RGV Sector are even more shocking. During the first three months of FY 2017, 30,293 family units were apprehended, 10,862 in December alone. The FY 2016 first-quarter apprehensions were reported to be 14, 337. Nearly 75 percent of all FMUA apprehensions this fiscal year occurred in the RGV sector.\n\nChildren crossing the border illegally also represent a huge problem for the agents of the RGV Sector. December saw 4,751 apprehensions of UACs. This was about the same as November 2016's 4,788 UAC apprehensions. Both months were dramatically higher than October when 4,085 UACs were apprehended in the RGV Sector.\n\nFox News reported the apprehension numbers are at a five-year high and that agents are slammed with work.\n\nTo respond to the surge of migrant border crossings, Border Patrol officials were forced to move agents from other front-line positions to help with the care of the minors being apprehended, along with the increasing FMUA apprehensions, Breitbart Texas reported in November.\n\nBorder Patrol officials in the RGV Sector announced that 150 agents were temporarily transferred from the Tucson, San Diego, and Del Rio Sectors to the McAllen and Weslaco Centralized Processing Centers. Their duty is to increase the screening and processing capacities for the migrants with a focus on UACs (unaccompanied Alien Children) and FMUAs (Family Unit Aliens), according to information obtained from Agent Castro\u00a0by Breitbart Texas.\n\nSeveral Border Patrol agents have expressed their frustration at being used as \"babysitters\" to Breitbart Texas. They stated that Mexican cartels have learned they can tie up Border Patrol agents by flooding a region with these children, mostly from Central America. They are then free to move their drug and other \"higher value\" human cargo through other locations.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection officials announced in December the opening of an additional holding facility for the seemingly endless flow of migrants, particularly unaccompanied children and incomplete family units. The facility will provide additional space for holding approximately 500 UACs and FMUAs. The new plant will be adjacent to the Donna-Rio Bravo International Bridge in Donna, Texas.\n\n\"Illicit networks facilitate the majority of cross-border activity and smugglers prey on migrants by extorting money, confining them in deplorable conditions, and often physically and sexually assaulting them,\" Agent Castro wrote in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas on November 12. \"Despite these risks, migrants continue to entrust their lives each day to these unscrupulous criminals.\"\n\nHealth and Human Services (HHS) officials announced\u00a0in December that they are overwhelmed with the flood of migrant children and families. To deal with the budgetary crisis, the department is stripping allocated funds from medical research and services originally marked for American citizens. During the last month before this announcement, an average of 255 UACs per day were placed in the custody of the ORR after being processed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials,\u00a0according to\u00a0the Center for Immigration Studies Director of Policy Studies Jessica Vaughn.\n\nTo temporarily deal with the costs, the department made drastic cuts to health services for American citizens. Now-former HHS Secretary Sylvia Matthews Burwell directed that $167 million be cut from other programs to cover the costs of services for the minors through December 9 when the current continuing resolution expired, Vaughn wrote at the time.\n\nThe newly confirmed and sworn-in Department of Homeland Security Secretary, retired Marine Corps General John F. Kelly, will now be faced with finding a plan to deal with the border surge.\n\nBob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

Park, reports CBS News, visited the mountainous nations of\u00a0Ethiopia, Uganda, and Kenya earlier this year. The office noted that she did not need to use the Viagra on her trip and that the order was precautionary.\n\nViagra \u201cwas originally developed to relieve high blood pressure,\u201d according to an article published by\u00a0the American Physiological Society\u00a0in Science Daily.\u00a0\u201cIt causes blood vessels in certain tissues, such as the lungs, to relax. This improves blood flow from the heart and increases oxygen transport to working muscles.\u201d As such, it aids in erectile dysfunction, but has also proven to improve athletic performance at high altitudes where breathing is more difficult and aid with altitude sickness.\n\nThe orders of a variety of drugs were reportedly so large because the Blue House makes such medical purchases for its entire staff, not just Park.\n\nPark is currently embroiled in a sweeping scandal that has engulfed major ruling party politicians, multinational corporations, and a secretive cult led by close family friends of Park\u2019s. The President\u2019s Viagra order has fallen under scrutiny after an\u00a0investigation revealed that Park had received vitamin injections from a doctor at an anti-aging clinic using the name of her close friend Choi Soon-sil, as well as that of Choi\u2019s sister and the name of the protagonist in a popular soap opera.\n\nIn a nationally televised speech, Park admitted that she had allowed longtime friend Choi to see drafts of pivotal policy speeches and edit them. She denied allegations that Choi was privy to delicate national security information or that she had participated in any illicit profiting schemes with Choi. Park gave a second speech vowing to comply with a full investigation into her behavior, where she was forced to also deny some of the more outlandish rumors regarding her relationship with Choi, including allegations that she allowed Choi to perform exorcisms in the Blue House.\n\nChoi\u2019s father,\u00a0Choi Tae-min, was the head of the \u201cEternal Life Church,\u201d described in South Korean media as a pseudo-Christian \u201ccult.\u201d The elder Choi reportedly claimed he could speak to the dead, a skill that attracted Park, as both of her parents were assassinated, her mother by a North Korean terrorist and her father by his own spy chief. In her first apology speech, Park admitted that \u201cloneliness\u201d following her parents\u2019 death contributed to her trust in the younger Choi.\n\nProsecutors are demanding to cross-examine Park personally as part of the larger criminal investigation. \"It is time for the prosecution to step up and request an arrest warrant for Park should she refuse to comply with another request for a face-to-face questioning,\" a prosecutor wrote in the prosecution's internal website server, according to the Korean newswire service Yonhap.\n\nWhile law enforcement has begun to dig deeper into the scandal, the legislature has announced that it will assemble an \u201cindependent counsel\u201d to probe the matter. Park spokesman\u00a0Jung Youn-kuk advised the legislator to choose \u201cbalanced and neutral figures\u201d to chair the counsel, lamenting that \u201cthere are many wrong reports that went too far.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.983922958374019, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 573, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 12, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.24992053304, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161124040000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 4.3630017452007, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2017/01/05/federal-proposal-strip-funds-sanctuary-campuses/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [764, 4603, 4764]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 701, "scraper_regex": 757}}, "headline": "Federal Proposal Would Strip Funds from Sanctuary Campuses", "wordcount_as_scraped": 757, "date": "20170105180000", "story_content": "A U.S. representative from California has introduced a bill to block Title IV funds to colleges and universities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.\n\nRepresentative Duncan Hunter (R-CA) introduced the No Funding for Sanctuary Campuses Act in late December to define \"sanctuary campus\" and create financial penalties for any \"institutions of higher education that violates immigration laws.\" The bill, H.R. 6530, was co-sponsored by Representatives Tom McClintock (R-CA) and Lou Barletta (R-PA).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s by no means unreasonable to expect the nation\u2019s higher learning institutions to follow the law the same way we expect states and localities to abide by the law,\u201d Hunter told the\u00a0Washington Examiner in an interview published on Tuesday. \u201cIf a school wants federal money, an open declaration that it\u2019s a sanctuary should disqualify it for federal support.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s free to do that, of course, but there should be a consequence in the form of withheld federal funding \u2014 it\u2019s that simple,\u201d the California congressman stated.\n\nThe bill defines a Sanctuary Campus as:\n\n(A) has in effect an ordinance, policy, or practice that prohibits or restricts any institutional entity, official, or personnel from\u2014\n(i) sending, receiving, maintaining, or exchanging with any Federal, State, or local government entity information regarding the citizenship or immigration status (lawful or unlawful) of any individual;\n(ii) complying with a request lawfully made by the Secretary of Homeland Security under section 236 or 287 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1226 or 1357) to comply with a detainer for, or notify about the release of, an individual; or\n(iii) otherwise complying with section 642 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1373);\n(B) brings in, or harbors, an alien in violation of section 274(a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1324(a)(1)(A));\nvar _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([\"embed\"]);(C) renders an alien who lacks a lawful immigration status in the United States eligible for any postsecondary education benefit provided on the basis of residence within a State (or a political subdivision of a State) to the same extent as a citizen or national of the United States is eligible for such benefit; or\n(D) has in effect a policy or practice that either prohibits, or in effect prevents, the Secretary of Homeland Security from gaining access to campuses or access to students (who are 17 years of age or older) on campuses, for purposes of Department of Homeland Security recruiting in a manner that is at least equal in quality and scope to the access to campuses and to students that is provided to any other employer.\n\nThe bill provides an exemption for any person who is a victim of or a witness to a criminal offense.\n\nThe bill would also penalize the institutions for providing any public benefit including in-state tuition.\n\n\"It is the sense of the Congress that providing the public benefit of in-state tuition to an alien who lacks lawful immigration status in the United States creates an incentive for illegal immigration and encourages and induces aliens to come to, enter,\" Hunter wrote in the bill.\n\nThe bill was introduced following actions by many campuses across the country to declare sanctuary status following the election of Donald Trump. Breitbart provided extensive coverage of these campus protests and the actions by university and college administrators. The President-Elect made cracking down on sanctuary jurisdictions a priority during his campaign.\n\nA similar bill was also introduced late last month by Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD), Breitbart Texas reported this week. The Federal Immigration Law Compliance Act of 2016 takes a broader approach of addressing both sanctuary campuses and other jurisdictions with similar policies.\n\n\"Congress has the responsibility to protect the rule of law in our country and provide for the safety of our citizens. We need to focus on protecting American citizens and those who are in this country legally, instead of providing shelter for those who have violated our immigration law and entered this country illegally. If any entity refuses to comply with federal immigration law, they should be denied federal money until they come into compliance,\" Congressman Harris said in a written statement obtained by Breitbart Texas.\n\nBoth bills were filed late in the 114th Congress. To be considered by the 115th Congress, the bills will need to be re-introduced.\n\nBob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

Trump repeated that promise at two campaign rallies in Michigan on Monday, one in Grand Rapids, and a second later in the day in Warren, which is in Macomb County, a suburb of Detroit.\n\nClinton, in contrast, has promised to increase the number of Syrian refugees annually by 550 percent, from the 10,000 originally proposed by the Obama administration for FY 2016 to 65,000 per year.\n\nThe Obama administration ended up resettling 12,500 Syrian refugees in FY 2016 out of the total 85,000 resettled in the United States that year.\n\nThough Clinton has been careful to avoid further comment on the number of refugees that would be resettled under her administration, her ideological allies at Refugee Council USA, the lobbying arm for the politically powerful refugee resettlement industry, have proposed increasing the number of refugees resettled in the United States to 200,000 in FY 2017.\n\nAs Breitbart News has reported previously, many critics of the federal refugee resettlement industry believe that if Clinton is elected president she will increase the number of refugees resettled in the United States to at least the 200,000 annual level proposed by Refugee Council USA.\n\nBy more than a two to one margin, polls indicate that voters disagree with Hillary Clinton\u2019s plans to increase the number of Syrian refugees resettled in the United States annually to 65,000 and the Refugee Council USA\u2019s proposals to increase the total number of refugees resettled to 200,000 annually.\n\nIn the most recent Breitbart/Gravis national poll, conducted between October 25 and October 26, 63 percent of voters said they disagreed with Hillary Clinton\u2019s position on increasing the number of refugees resettled in the United States, while 26 percent agreed with her position.\n\nTexas, which recently informed the Obama administration that it is withdrawing from the federal refugee resettlement program in January, received more refugees in October\u20131,097\u2013than any other state.\n\nCalifornia (814), New York (554), Arizona (551), Michigan (550), Washington (498), Ohio (452), Georgia (365), Pennsylvania (335), and North Carolina (312) rounded out the top ten states for refugee resettlement in October.\n\n\n\nOne thousand two hundred and ninety-seven Syrian refugees, 1,282 of whom were Muslim (98.8 percent), were among the 9,935 refugees resettled in the United States in October.\n\nMichigan was by far the top destination state for Syrian refugees, with 206 during October.\n\nCalifornia (140), Texas (89), Arizona (88), Pennsylvania (70), Florida (69), Ohio (65), Maryland (63), New York (60), and Georgia (59) rounded out the top ten states for Syrian refugee resettlement in October\n\n\n\nCalifornia and Michigan were the top two states for Syrian refugee resettlement in FY 2016 as well, when 12,500 Syrian refugees were resettled in the United States.\n\nAt the current monthly rate, more than 15,000 Syrian refugees will be resettled in the United States in FY 2017.\n\nGrassroots opposition to Syrian refugee resettlement in Michigan has increased significantly over the past several months.\n\nIn September, L. Brooks Patterson, Oakland County, Michigan county executive, said he intends to sue the federal government over the resettlement of refugees, many of whom are Syrian, in the county on the grounds it has failed to comply with the consultation clause of the Refugee Act of 1980.\n\nIn October, the trustees of Watership Township, also in Oakland County,\u00a0unanimously passed a resolution stating that the township would not cooperate with the federal refugee resettlement program.\n\nDuring the first ten months of calendar year 2016, CNS News reports:\n\nThe Obama administration has resettled 13,210 Syrian refugees into the United States since the beginning of 2016 \u2013 an increase of 675 percent over the same 10-month period in 2015.\nOf those, 13,100 (99.1 percent) are Muslims \u2013 12,966 Sunnis, 24 Shi'a, and 110 other Muslims \u2013 and 77 (0.5 percent) are Christians. Another 24 (0.18 percent) are Yazidis.\nDuring the Jan.-Oct. period in 2015, 1,705 Syrian refugees were admitted, of whom 1,664 (97.5 percent) were Muslims and 29 (1.7 percent) were Christians.\nMeanwhile the surge of Syrian refugee admissions initiated by the administration last February has continued into the new fiscal year, now one month-old: A total of 1,297 were resettled during October \u2013 a 593 percent increase over the 187 admitted in October 2015.\n\nOne thousand three hundred and fifty-two Somali refugees, 1,350 of whom were Muslim (99.8 percent) were among the 9,935 refugees resettled in the United States in October.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported previously, Somali refugees have experienced high rates of active tuberculosis (TB) and caused public health concerns in states in which they have resettled, particularly in Minnesota, where at least 304 refugees have been diagnosed with active TB over the past six years.\n\nNew York, with 138 Somali refugees resettled in October, and Minnesota, with 135 Somali refugees resettled in the month, were the top two destination states for Somali refugees in October.\n\nOhio (93), Texas (90), Arizona (79), Washington (72), Kentucky (69), Missouri (49), Pennsylvania (45), and Michigan (43) rounded out the top ten states for Somali refugee resettlement in October.\n\n\n\n\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 22, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.44444465637207, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 980, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 6.2681142458000005, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 22, "mft_sum": 25, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161101220000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.27272727273, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.55102040816327, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/milo/2016/12/20/milos-absolutely-positively-serious-advice-mtv/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [561, 717, 835, 1613, 1835, 1866, 2349, 2378, 2772, 2803, 3087, 3286, 3451, 3470, 3707, 4565, 4609, 5575, 6093, 6267, 6436, 6884, 7258, 7271, 7515, 7634, 8462, 8488, 8547, 8550, 8595]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1400, "scraper_regex": 1514}}, "headline": "MILO: Here Are My 2017 New Year\u2019s Resolutions for MTV", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1514, "date": "20161221000000", "story_content": "MTV must be tired of hearing from the haters. Whether it\u2019s old people complaining that they stopped showing rock videos, or people my age complaining they stopped showing rap videos, it must be a tough job to run music television.\n\nBut I have some good news, MTV. I\u2019m here to tell you that you\u2019re on the right track. And I want to give you some tips to kick it up another gear in 2017.\n\nWe do have to face some hard truths. You\u2019ve gone from being the cultural epicenter for American youth in the 90s to a sad\u00a0also-ran. The network that made Bill Clinton cool with his retarded saxophone solo couldn\u2019t even move the needle for sick Hillary this year.\n\nAnd to top it\u00a0off, you\u2019re the network so liberal that you leave CNN and MSNBC stress-eating, yet you only joined the social-justice\u00a0bandwagon completely in 2016, when you started hiring the most batshit insane bloggers you could find to turn MTV.com into perhaps the most laughably stupid \u2014 and hateful, if you have the misfortune of being white and male \u2014 website on the internet. What took you so long?\n\nIn case you missed it, MTV has grabbed some young people that would fit in perfectly at the typical anti-Milo protest on my Dangerous Faggot tour of American campuses, and had them smugly recite SJW phrases like: \u201cBlue Lives Matter isn\u2019t a thing.\u201d\n\nPerhaps confused by the massive backlash against the video on social media, MTV pulled down the video from YouTube, but has reposted it with a silly excuse about updating the graphics. They are lying: the reason they did it was to hide all the downvotes.\u00a0Please take a moment to watch it:\n\nHey, white guys: we came up for some New Year's Resolutions for you. pic.twitter.com/C9EeIY6wig\n\u2014 MTV News (@MTVNews) December 19, 2016\n\n\n\nAs you\u2019d expect, the reaction from everyone who\u00a0isn\u2019t a full-blown campus loon\u00a0is to mock this video and the insane politics behind it. As we\u2019ve witnessed since the election, liberals are continuing to use the same tactics of division that lost them the election, but to an even greater degree.\n\nOf course, none of this has surprised me. When it comes to culture I\u2019m sort of like Nostradamus if he\u2019d been a handsome, witty minor celebrity with a great head of hair instead of a crusty old dude from the olden days. In fact, I explained exactly what MTV is doing\u00a0last year in a column called\u00a0Minority Wars.\n\nMTV doesn\u2019t have the option of going backwards. This new brand of left-wing politics in which practically everyone is racist, sexist or deplorable isn\u2019t compatible with the glory years of the network. Rock music videos are so drenched in toxic masculinity that all the safe spaces in the world couldn\u2019t handle the tsunami of fragile young adults that would tweet mean things at\u00a0them if MTV aired those videos\u00a0again.\n\nRap videos are just as bad \u2014 all of that sexism towards black women, not to mention the negative stereotypes! Liberals would be happy with rap videos full of men twerking perhaps, but let me tell you from personal experience, black rappers prefer to keep homosexuality on the\u00a0DL.\n\nDeep in my heart, I care about social-justice warriors. Yes, I openly scorn them at every stop on my acclaimed, sell-out Dangerous Faggot Tour, but it comes from a place of love. Think of me as\u00a0the Grinch: I have stolen SJW fun and power at every step, but as the spirit of Christmas has taken me over, I\u2019m writing not to mock MTV and their loony progressive\u00a0YouTube stars, but\u00a0to give them some friendly advice.\n\nThe only road to success for MTV is to combine their newfound SJW values with their library of classic shows. I\u2019d call this a \u201ctwo birds with one stone\u201d solution to make MTV great again, but I know it\u00a0would trigger the vegans on staff and the network cannot afford extended crying sessions from its creative talent right now.\n\nWithout further ado, I am proud to present Milo\u2019s MTV reboots:\n\nDaria bin Laden \u2014 Daria was a lesbian icon, a proto-SJW without the bad dye job. Why not bring her back as the ultimate Muslim cartoon character? Costs would be low: Daria and the other key female characters would be in burkas the whole time. Daria could go on amazing adventures, like praising the stoning of women and telling ignorant American characters how important female genital mutilation is to her culture. The whole first season could be about her arranged marriage.\n\nThis show practically writes itself! I would have to make sure that Daria\u2019s best friend Jane Lane dies in an honor killing, because I always hated that bitch.\n\nPimp My Ride: Da\u2019esh Edition \u00a0\u2014 There is a whole army of ISIS heartthrobs\u00a0riding around in plain white Toyota trucks paid for by the CIA, or whoever. But you can\u2019t be a stylish terrorist in a factory fresh pickup, so MTV is going to help you pimp your ride! Yes, the format is the same, there will still be the requisite, \u201cYo dawg, we heard you like weapons, so we added forward and rear-facing machine guns.\u201d\n\nNot only will every episode be heartwarming as a Jihadist gets the terror platform of their dreams, western audiences will pick up useful armor tips for driving around danger zones like Columbus, Ohio, Dearborn, Michigan and of course Chiraq.\n\nMTV Uneaten \u2014 The acoustic concert program MTV Unplugged can\u2019t return in its original form, because there just isn\u2019t enough decent SJW talent. So MTV Unplugged will now be MTV Uneaten, featuring obese feminists gorging themselves half to death, live on TV, to the sympathetic cooing of the presenters.\n\nEach week will feature a different cuisine \u2014 or, as is more likely, pizza joint \u2014\u00a0and the larger-than-life ladies will eat and drink their fill in between complimenting each other\u2019s health as women of size, and of course their amazing bravery.\n\n(Note: This one needs some work \u2014 we run the risk of cultural appropriation based on food selection, and the hosts will be frequently replaced due to obesity-related illness and death. Healthy at any size!)\n\nViva La BLM \u2014 Bam Margera doesn\u2019t fit with the new MTV. He\u2019s too white, and too male. Viva La Bam will return as the network\u2019s flagship show about\u00a0Black Lives Matter. The crew will pull hilarious pranks like threatening police officers, burning down the local 7-Eleven, stealing plasma TVs and making life hell for other\u00a0black people.\n\nOne problem here will be pinning down the cast, Black Lives Matter leaders are notorious for disappearing as soon as accountability comes around. But the\u00a0network people can work out these little details \u2014 that\u2019s why they make the big bucks. Besides, it\u2019s not like BLM is lacking in braindead frauds and attention-seekers. Shaun King and Deray were made for reality TV.\n\nThe Real SJW World \u2014 The Real World was MTV\u2019s original reality series, combining a cast of strangers that fit into convenient character types in an early effort to brainwash young adults. It needs rebooting to include a cast that\u2019s\u00a0strictly progressive. Imagine the fireworks when the whole house competes to be the biggest victim! What better chance to show how tolerant Europe has become by a group of genderqueers visiting the \u201cjungle\u201d in Calais \u2014 or staging a gay pride parade outside a mosque in Paris?\n\nI suppose you can have a white straight male in the house, but only as the requisite villain who\u00a0gets lynched\u00a0in the second episode. Of course MTV will be limited to seasons in a few cities like San Francisco, but I\u2019d still watch it.\n\nBeavis and Butthead \u2014 Mike Judge\u2019s beloved metalheads will be the only classic MTV show to come back more or less true\u00a0to the original material. This is MTV\u2019s opportunity to continue mocking white males \u2014 the whole point of their YouTube\u00a0tips video. The existing fanbase will love it, and SJWs can watch it ironically to remember just how evil white males are on days they don\u2019t leave the echo chamber.\n\nAt the end of the first season, MTV can join the newest liberal cause of making pedophiles cool and acceptable people by including a plotline in which Beavis and Butt-head separately have love affairs with male teachers.\n\nMTV didn\u2019t reach prominence by playing it safe, so if they want to survive, they need to double down on SJW politics and take my programming advice.They\u2019ve painted themselves into a corner, but it can be a lucrative corner if they stop thinking like TV execs and start thinking like the spoiled brats that infest college campuses. Because we all know social justice is just good business, right?\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m a fucking visionary.\n\nFollow\u00a0Milo Yiannopoulos (@Nero)\u00a0on Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat.

They've lived with the fact that they could have been aborted. The humanity of the unborn child is obvious on any ultrasound machine.\"\n\nStill, Chaput argues, a fear of living \"outside the cone of public approval\" leads many to shirk their personal responsibility for changing society. In the case of abortion, \"many of us are happy to live with half-truths and ambiguity rather than risk being cut out of the herd. The culture of lies thrives on our own complicity, lack of courage, and self- deception.\"\n\nThe Archbishop also assails \"chronic newsroom prejudice\" in the shaping of certain kinds of news, especially in the abortion debate, as evidenced by the wildly imbalanced coverage of the pro-abortion Women's March on Washington this week as compared with the annual March for Life.\n\nThus, \"Planned Parenthood is assumed good, while critics who secretly film its cynicism, profiteering, and barbarism are assumed bad,\" he notes.\n\nMeanwhile, \"the language of 'abortion rights,' common in most newsrooms, has the familiar Orwellian ring of avoiding an unpleasant reality (killing a child in utero) by calling it something else,\" he notes. \"Thus does the magic of words rework the sinews of the universe.\"\n\nThe Archbishop reserves some choice expressions to summarize the last eight years under the Obama administration.\n\n\"The White House elected to power in November 2008 campaigned on compelling promises of hope, change, and bringing the nation together,\" he said. \"The reality it delivered for eight years was rather different: a brand of leadership that was narcissistic, aggressively secular, ideologically divisive, resistant to compromise, unwilling to accept responsibility for its failures, and generous in spreading blame.\"\n\nNowhere was the aggressively secular agenda more evident than in the matter of abortion and religious freedom.\n\n\"The same intolerance marked the administration's fight to coerce abortion and contraceptive services as part of national health care,\" Chaput contends. \"It tenaciously refused reasonable compromise on exemptions for religiously affiliated providers and organizations and deliberately sought to break any opposition\u2014 prompting a sardonic Wall Street Journal editorial renaming the Little Sisters of the Poor 'the Little Sisters of the Government.'\"\n\nAnd thus, we live in an age \"when almost every scientific advance seems to be matched by some new cruelty in our entertainment, cynicism in our politics, ignorance of the past, consumer greed, subtle genocides posing as rights like the cult of abortion, and a basic confusion about what\u2014if anything distinctive at all\u2014it means to be human,\" he argues.\n\nFortunately, the book deals not only with diagnosing our diseases but also in prescribing remedies for them\u2014mostly in the form of more authentic engagement with the deeper truths of human existence and a bracing evangelism capable of rendering the Christian message winsome and liberating in a world jaded by disbelief.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

Reuters cites\u00a0Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) as saying that 120 others were wounded, some seriously and many still trapped in the refugee camp with minimal medical care.\n\nThe Nigerian newspaper Vanguard puts the number of injured at over 100, citing a government source who said the bombing was part of \u201cmop-up operations\u201d meant to eradicate a small cluster of Boko Haram terrorists.\n\nVanguard has also published the official version of events from\u00a0Major-General Lucky Irabor, the Chief of Army Staff:\n\nThis morning (yesterday), we received reports about gathering of Boko Haram terrorists somewhere in Kala Balge Local Government area of Borno State. We got a coordinate and I directed that the air should go to address the problem. Unfortunately, the strike was conducted but it turned out that the locals somewhere in Rann were affected.\n\nMaj. Gen. Irabor noted that some of those killed and wounded were also members of international aid groups like MSF and the International Red Cross. These groups have estimated that \u201cat least 90\u201d wounded individuals are trapped in the camp and neighboring Rann village, according to the Associated Press, and are demanding the Nigerian government provide transportation to well-equipped medical facilities.\n\nThe government has begun issuing official apologies for the incident. President Muhammadu Buhari called the incident a\u00a0\u201cregrettable operational mistake\u201d in his apology. His information minister, meanwhile, called the bombing \u201cnot a true reflection of the level of professionalism\u201d of the military.\n\nAbba Kyari, Buhari\u2019s chief of staff, said in a statement, \u201cthis kind of incident happens occasionally in war.\u201d\n\n\"The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) is saddened by today's accidental air strike by its fighter jet at Rann in Kala Balge area of Borno State in which some innocent lives were lost,\u201d the air force said in a statement.\n\nThe Nigerian Senate called for the military to cease bombing civilians. \u201cWe urge the military, especially the air force; to as much as possible ensure that this does not happen again,\u201d\u00a0Deputy Senate President Ike Ekeremadu said, thanking the nation\u2019s \u201cgallant soldiers\u201d for their service.\n\nWhile multiple government officials have echoed each other in referring to the airstrike as an anomaly, the Nigerian military has long struggled with disciplinary and execution issues. Thousands of Nigerian soldiers have refused to fight Boko Haram, fearing their own deaths and protesting that they are not sufficiently armed to successfully complete the orders handed to them.\n\nSoldiers have also been accused of gross misconduct with Boko Haram victims. In October, Human Rights Watch accused Nigerian soldiers of raping women and girls trapped in the refugee camp. In some cases, girls and women protested that they had been drugged and raped; in others, the victims said they consented to sexual relations after being romanced and, upon finding out they were pregnant, the soldiers would disappear. Human Rights Watch compiled the testimonies of 43 female members of the camp who experienced \u201csexual abuse, including rape, and exploitation.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian government has repeatedly claimed that Boko Haram, once the deadliest wing of the deadliest terrorist group in the world, has been conclusively defeated. Buhari announced in December 2015 that \u201ctechnically, we have won the war\u201d on Boko Haram. In January 2016, after a Boko Haram attack proved this to be a suspect claim, Irabor\u2019s predecessor Lt.

Al Sharpton, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, and others charging that they inflamed and inspired a \u201cWar on Police.\u201d\n\nThe father of 32-year-old Dallas Police Officer Patrick Zamarripa, Enrigue Zamarripa, also sued: Rev. Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network; Black Lives Matter organizers Rashad Turner, Opal Tometi, Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza, Deray McKesson, Johnetta Elzie; Malik Zulu Shabazz, leader of the New Black Panthers Party; and George Soros, a huge financial supporter of Black Lives Matter, reported the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Mr. Zamarripa lives in Fort Worth.\n\nThe\u00a0Star-Telegram\u00a0reported that the 43-page lawsuit filed in federal court asks for up to $550 million in damages.\n\n\"While Defendant Black Lives Matter claims to combat anti-black racism,\" the federal complaint was reported to state, \"the movement has in fact incited and committed further violence, severe bodily injury and death against police officers of all races and ethnicities, Jews, and Caucasians. Defendant Black Lives Matter is in fact a violent and revolutionary criminal gang.\"\n\nThe father\u2019s lawsuit, filed by Freedom Watch, urges that Micah Johnson was \"acting as an agent of and at and under the direction of\" the defendants. As reported by Breitbart News in August, the group is representing\u00a0Patricia Smith and Charles Woods, the parents of Sean Smith and Tyrone Woods, who died during the September 11, 2012 Benghazi attacks. Hillary Clinton is the defendant in the case.\n\nBreitbart Texas reported\u00a0on July 7, that Micah Xavier Johson killed five police officers, and wounded six others (including one civilian) at a Black Lives Matter protest in Dallas. The former Army Reservist said he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers. He was killed by Dallas PD when officers sent a robot to where he was hiding and detonated a bomb. As reported, a\u00a0Facebook profile search\u00a0showed that Johnson's profile photo showed him dressed in a dashiki, holding a clenched fist in the air. His cover photos was a black liberation flag and a black power fist. And although he did not expressly say he was a member of the black militant Muslim Nation of Islam, he had liked pages relating to the deceased founder, Elijah Mohammed. He also liked several militant and black separatist groups such as The New Black Panther Party and the African American Defense League.\n\nAs reported by Breitbart News in August of 2015, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan told the many gathered in\u00a0Miami at Mt. Zion Baptist Church, that he was looking for \"10,000\u00a0fearless men\" to \"rise up and kill those who kill us; stalk them and kill them and let them feel the pain of death that we are feeling!\" His speech, captured on video (video is in the article), shows him telling those there:\n\n\"I'm looking for 10,000\u00a0in the midst of a million. Ten thousand fearless men who say death is sweeter than continued life under tyranny. Death is sweeter than continuing to live and bury our children while the white folks give our killers hamburgers. Death is sweeter than watching us slaughter each other to the joy of a 400-year-old enemy. Death is sweeter. The Quran teaches persecution is worse than slaughter. Then it says retaliation is prescribed in matters of the slain. Retaliation is a prescription from God to calm the breasts of those whose children have been slain. So if the federal government won't intercede in our affairs, then we must rise up and kill those who kill us; stalk them and kill them and let them feel the pain of death that we are feeling!\"\n\nAl Sharpton has characterized law enforcement officers in this country as racist and evil, as reported by Breitbart News in December 2014. He helped lead the false narratives of \"Hands Up, Don't Shoot\" and \"I Can't Breathe\" after Michael Brown and Eric Garner were shot and killed by police officers. Sharpton was blamed after the two New York Police Department officers were ambushed and assassinated on December 20, 2014 as they sat in their squad car. Breitbart News reported that one week earlier on December 13, Sharpton and his National Action Network organized a protest of families of blacks killed by police. The protest was in New York and protesters chanted\u2013\"What do we want? Dead cops!\"\n\n\n\nBreitbart News reported in August that a hacked Soros memo revealed that George Soros's Open Society Institute looked at the 2015 Baltimore unrest after the death of Freddie Gray as creating a \u201c\u2018unique opportunity\u2019 to create \u2018accountability\u2019 for the Baltimore police while aiding activists in reforming the city.\u201d The memo showed that his organization\u00a0approved $650,000 to \"invest in technical assistance and support for the groups at the core of the burgeoning #BlackLivesMatter movement.\"\n\nAs also\u00a0reported by Breitbart Texas,\u00a0Micah X. Johnson, the killer of the five Dallas police officers, was a member of the Houston New Black Panther Party. He was a member for about six months a few years ago.\u00a0Breitbart Texas was\u00a0present at an armed march\u00a0carried out by the Houston New Black Panther Party in August 2015 at the Waller County, Texas, jail where Sandra Bland committed suicide. Members of the armed New Black Panther Party stood across from a line of Harris County Sheriff Mounted Patrol deputies and chanted\u2013\"We will start creeping up on you in the darkness.\" They also yelled \"Off the pigs,\" and \"Oink oink, bang bang.\"\n\nAlthough it is presently unknown whether there is a correlation between these events, Harris County Deputy Darren Goforth was executed just 31 miles from the Waller County jail less than two weeks later. One of\u00a0the members holding an AR-15 style rifle appears to be\u00a0Micah Xavier Johnson.\n\nA lawsuit that is similar to the one filed by Mr. Zamarripa, reported by Breitbart Texas in mid-September, was filed by the president of the Dallas Fallen Officer Foundation, Dallas Police Department Sergeant Demetrick Pennie. Named as defendants in that lawsuit are: George Soros; President Barack Obama; former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder; Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton;\u00a0as well as Farrakhan, Sharpton and the National Action Network; Malik Zulu Shabazz and the New Black Panthers, and leaders in the Black Lives Matter movement. The lawsuit charges that these individuals\u00a0incited racial violence against police officers.\n\nThe lawsuit by Mr. Zamarripa does not name the Next Generation Action Network or those that helped organize the July 7 Black Lives Matter protest in Dallas as defendants, reported the Fort Worth paper.\n\nLana Shadwick\u00a0is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

AP and Russia Today and International Business Times\n\nRelated Articles\n\nRussia will build major naval base in Tartus, Syria\n\nFor the first time in decades, Russia is coming back as a major military naval power in the Mideast, now that Russia and Syria have signed a long-term agreement to build a large naval base in Tartus, Syria, on the Mediterranean Sea. In addition, the agreement allows Russia to expand its Hmeymim airbase in Latakia in Syria.\n\nAccording to the agreement, Russia can station up to 11 warships, including nuclear-powered warships, at Tartus. The facility will be completely controlled by Russia. It is immune from \u201csearch, requisition, arrest or executory measures\u201d by Syrian officials.\n\nAccording to Andrey Krasov, head of the State Duma\u2019s Defense Committee, the only purpose of the naval base is to fight terrorism:\n\nRussia needs this base to be present in this region. Unlike NATO, the Russian Federation is the guarantor of security in the world. In Syria, we fight against international terrorism not only by words, but also by deeds. Both Russian Aerospace Defense Forces and Russian Navy's ship groups demonstrate their professionalism, high qualifications in supporting the Syrian Armed Forces in the fight against terrorism. We are doing everything possible in order for long-suffering Syria to be cleansed from this plague \u2015 international terrorism.\nWhen in the 1990s we did not hold any drills and closed our bases one by one \u2015 in Cam Ranh (Vietnam), in Cuba \u2015 no one cared about this, everybody was clapping their hands. And now, when we rose from our knees, when we started to actively train our forces \u2013 and we are doing this on our own territory \u2013 our defense-industrial companies produce the most modern weapons, and no other army in the world has such equipment and such weapons \u2013 this worries someone. We are worried, however, that NATO is approaching our borders. We do not get closer to anybody, but by these actions, we are returning the positions lost earlier, we are returning our presence in this region.\n\nHowever, Krasov was contradicted by Igor Korotchenko, a Russian military expert, who says that the base will actually have a much larger purpose than just fighting terrorism: \u201cIt will make it possible for Russia to keep control of the entire Mediterranean region, i.e. the Middle East, North Africa and NATO's southern borders. In terms of military strategy, it gives big possibilities for control over the most important geopolitical processes in the region\u2026 The mere fact of the presence of Russian warships and submarines, especially those armed with Kalibr cruise missiles, will make it possible to keep control of the entire region and repel any threats.\u201d Deutsche Welle and Tass and Straits Times and Tass\n\nRelated Articles\n\nKEYS: Generational Dynamics, Syria, Bashar al-Assad, Russia, Turkey, Islamic State / of Iraq and Syria/Sham/the Levant, IS, ISIS, ISIL, Daesh, Tartus, Latakia, Hmeymim airbase, Andrey Krasov, Igor Korotchenko Permanent web link to this article Receive daily World View columns by e-mail", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 1, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.953125, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 686, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 7, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.42916167562, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170124140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.0612244897959195, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/12/02/senate-republicans-strip-religious-freedom-protection-defense-spending-bill/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3337]}}, "headline": "Senate Republicans Strip Religious Freedom Protection from Defense Spending Bill", "wordcount_as_scraped": 538, "date": "20161202190000", "story_content": "Senate Republicans have agreed to a deal that strips an amendment protecting religious freedom for faith-based organizations from a defense spending bill, making the measure more favorable to signature by outgoing President Barack Obama.\n\nObama threatened to veto the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) if the bill included the Russell Amendment, which applies religious freedom exemptions to federal grants and contracts. The NDAA is an annual piece of legislation that addresses Department of Defense budget and expenditures.\n\nThe Russell Amendment restated current United States law via the First Amendment. The measure would have protected, for example, faith groups that run adoption facilities and hold beliefs in traditional marriage from being refused federal grants and contracts because of those beliefs.\n\n\"Americans are fed up with Washington bureaucrats,\" said Kristina Arriaga, executive director of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. \"The leadership of the 115th Congress must double down against, not concede to, ridiculous, fact-free accusations meant to derail legitimate lawmaking.\"\n\nThe Becket Fund continues:\n\nThe Russell Amendment was designed to protect the hiring practices of faith-based organizations that provide critical services to soldiers in war zones, refugees, victims of human and sex trafficking, and veterans, among others. These religious charities are often the best\u2014sometimes the only\u2014groups willing to provide these services.\nThe Russell Amendment protects religious providers who partner with the government from being forced to hire those who do not share their religious beliefs, a right that other religious employers have enjoyed without controversy for more than half a century. Religious organizations that partner with the government are entitled to the same protection. They are awarded government contracts and grants because they are the best and most cost-efficient at meeting the needs of vulnerable populations, and they do not discriminate in providing services.var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([\"embed\"]);\n\nThe Becket Fund notes that most of the Democrats who referred to the Russell Amendment as \"discriminatory\" voted for nearly identical language in 2013.\n\n\"Yet the Senate's Republican leadership caved to Democrats' attacks and to pressure from the White House, simply so they could get a quick spending deal signed,\" Becket adds.\n\nSupporters of gay rights groups such as the Human Rights Campaign and the American Civil Liberties Union protested the amendment.\n\nHeritage Foundation analysts Roger Severino and Melanie Israel, however, reported on Obama's threat to veto the NDAA with the Russell Amendment included:\n\nObama would interpret existing religious protections narrowly in order to make religious groups bend to the LGBT agenda. As seen in the administration's education and health care mandates on gender identity, in practice, this means requiring employee bathrooms and showers meant for women be opened to biological men who self-identify as female regardless of people's religious beliefs on the matter. The administration's proven lack of respect for religious freedom when it comes to sexual orientation and gender identity policies is more than enough reason to keep\u00a0the Russell Amendment.\n\n\"Now, because Congress ducked this important issue, more service providers will be unable to continue offering their critical services, services that are sometimes only offered by religious groups,\" Arriaga said. \"It is the refugees, homeless, trafficking victims, veterans, and other vulnerable populations who will suffer the most from Congress's choice to prioritize political expediency over principled governance.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.892857134342194, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 516, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.6095818353499998, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161202190000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.4573643410852695, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2017/01/30/silicon-valley-elites-lash-out-over-trumps-temporary-halt-on-refugees/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [379, 805, 818, 870]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 523, "scraper_regex": 598}}, "headline": "Silicon Valley Elites Lash Out over Trump\u2019s Temporary Halt on Refugees", "wordcount_as_scraped": 598, "date": "20170130170000", "story_content": "Tech giants across Silicon Valley, such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Netflix, have come out in opposition of President Donald Trump's temporary halt on refugees from certain countries entering the United States.\n\niNews reports that tech leaders from across Silicon Valley have condemned the temporary halt\u00a0as \"un-American\" and \"morally wrong.\" Apple CEO Tim Cook was one of the first to speak out, saying in a company wide email, \"In my conversations with officials here in Washington this week, I've made it clear that Apple believes deeply in the importance of immigration \u2014 both to our company and to our nation's future.\" \n\nCook claimed, \"Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do.\u201d\u00a0He also said\u00a0Apple would be reaching out to the White House \"to \u00a0explain the negative effect on our coworkers and our company.\" \n\nGoogle's Chief Executive Officer, Sundar Pichai, sent a note to Google employees saying, \"It's painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues.

Stauber, argues the issue is no longer about looted art, but simply well-documented ownership rights to a painting purchased in good faith.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Stauber says, Cassirer forfeited her ownership rights when she accepted $13,000 from the German government in 1958 for the painting\u2019s loss.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no dispute about the painting\u2019s complete history. The court examined all the evidence and determined that the museum is the rightful owner of the painting,\u201d Stauber said, referencing a federal judge\u2019s ruling in Los Angeles last year.\n\nUS District Judge John F. Walter determined that under Spanish law the artwork belongs to the museum, but he concluded that when Cassirer accepted payment for the painting in 1958, she had no idea it still existed.\n\nThat shows, Boies says, that Cassirer never signed away her rights.\n\nHer great-grandson, David Cassirer, said his family didn\u2019t learn of the work\u2019s existence until a friend of his late father, Claude, saw it in a museum catalog in 1999.\n\n\u201cShe immediately called my dad because he had told her about the missing painting and had showed her a photo of the missing painting,\u201d said Cassirer, who lives in San Diego. \u201cAnd he was completely stunned because we thought the painting was gone.\u201d\n\nSleuthing by both sides revealed that soon after Lilly Cassirer and her husband left Germany, the work\u2014originally acquired by Lilly\u2019s father-in-law from Pissarro\u2019s art dealer\u2014was sold to an anonymous German buyer.\n\nIt eventually arrived in the United States and was subsequently bought and sold more than once before Baron Hans-Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza, scion of Germany\u2019s Thyssen steel empire and one of the 20th century\u2019s most prominent art collectors, acquired it from New York gallery owner Stephen Hahn in 1976.\n\nThyssen-Bornemisza, who died in 2002, gave the painting and the rest of his collection to the Spanish government in 1993, creating the museum that bears his name.\n\nAfter the museum refused to hand over the work, the Cassirer family sued.\n\nAt one point, a judge dismissed the lawsuit, saying California law extending the statute of limitations for art theft to 100 years infringed on the federal government\u2019s authority. But the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the case reheard, leading to Walter\u2019s ruling last year in favor of the museum. The appeals court now takes up the issue again at Monday\u2019s hearing before a three-judge panel in Pasadena.\n\nBoies argues the judge misinterpreted Spanish law in issuing last year\u2019s ruling and that in any case, Spain is a signatory to international treaties that seek to return looted art to its rightful owners.\n\nHe pointed out that just last Monday, France returned a 16th century portrait attributed to Joos van Cleve or his son to the descendants of another German-Jewish couple forced to sell when they fled Germany. He said Spain should follow France\u2019s lead.\n\n\u201cThe message that the Spanish museum\u2019s argument sends to the people who would loot art today is a terrible message and one that is really shameful,\u201d he said.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.9253910779953, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 735, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 2.47966939945, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 20, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161205090000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.7210884353741496, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.8181818181799998}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/01/25/frank-gaffney-trump-restores-reagans-peace-through-strength-its-better-to-be-a-friend-of-the-u-s-than-an-enemy/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [9134, 9147]}}, "headline": "Frank Gaffney: Trump Restores Reagan\u2019s \u2018Peace Through Strength\u2019; 'It's Better to Be a Friend of the U.S. Than an Enemy'", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1514, "date": "20170126050000", "story_content": "Center for Security Policy President Frank Gaffney discussed the Trump administration's opening national-security moves with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Wednesday's Breitbart News Daily.\n\nGaffney began with a story about one of his colleagues delivering copies of the Center for Security Policy's book CAIR Is Hamas on Capitol Hill and discovering he couldn't deliver a copy to noted voter-ID opponent Sen. Pat Leahy (D-VT) without a government ID.\n\nLISTEN:\n\n\n\n\"This individual could vote without that ID, of course, but he can't give Senator Leahy a book about an internal threat to our country from Hamas. It's just ridiculous,\" Gaffney said.\n\nHe pronounced himself pleased with President Trump's first week, saluting \"the signaling, and the executive orders, and the statements that the President has made thus far, and the statements for that matter that even people like Rex Tillerson and his confirmation hearing made about the nature of the challenges we're facing internationally and the necessity of rebuilding our military to contend with them.\"\n\nAmong those necessary measures he included constructing a state-of-the-art missile defense system and eradicating radical Islamic terrorism from the face of the earth, as Trump has promised.\n\n\"These are very encouraging signs,\" Gaffney said. \"It's not so much an aggressive national security policy, Alex, with respect. It's a common-sense policy that's rooted in the principle that Ronald Reagan, my old boss, espoused and practiced called 'Peace Through Strength.' I think it's very welcome, and long overdue, frankly.\"\n\nHe noted that, with the exception of the invasion of Grenada, Reagan didn't \"actually have to use our military power,\" but he rebuilt it and \"created, as part of a larger strategy, conditions that brought down our principal enemy \u2013 without firing, as they say, a shot \u2013 the Soviet Union.\"\n\n\"I think Donald Trump gets this. If you want to prevent wars, prepare to fight them,\" he advised. \"There are a lot of people around the world who witnessed Barack Obama take the opposite approach, weaken us, hollow out our military, signal a desire for appeasement at any price. And they became much more dangerous.\" \n\n\"The prospect of a conflict with Communist China today, Alex, as you know, is vastly higher than it was a decade ago,\" he pointed out. \"And that's partly because the Chinese have been rapidly building the military with which to attack us, and to dominate the South China Sea, and so on. But partly it's also because they have perceived the opportunity for either getting what they want without conflict, their strategy of strength to obtain their objectives \u2013 or they think if they do have to have a conflict with us, they'll prevail in it.\" \n\n\"So this is a very dangerous approach. It's been proven to fail time and time again, whereas I believe peace through strength has been proven to work rather consistently throughout the course of human history,\" Gaffney asserted.\n\nMarlow asked Gaffney about the significance of President Trump's plan to move the U.S. embassy for Israel to Jerusalem. Gaffney described the long-standing state of affairs as \"bizarre,\" noting that Israel is the only country he knows of where the U.S. embassy isn't located in the national capital.\n\n\"The signals that Donald Trump has sent, in terms of his commitment to restore the kind of strong partnership and strategic alliance that we have historically had with Israel, is a signal, a statement, of his break with his predecessor,\" he said. \"It's important not just because it matters to our security whether Israel is secure, but it's also important because it restores the sense that it's also better to be a friend of the United States than an enemy.\"\n\n\"Obama had that completely backwards, and as a result we had more enemies, and I think fewer friends,\" he observed ruefully.\n\nGaffney said moving the U.S. embassy was \"important in a number of respects,\" beginning with Jerusalem being \"the rightful place for us to be represented.\"\n\n\"Second of all, it sends a signal of our commitment to Israel, and the status of Jerusalem as the undivided eternal capital of the Jewish state,\" he continued. \"People talk a lot about, well, there will be violence, there will be the Palestinians and holy war and all the rest. I seriously doubt it, because I think the Arabs at this moment more generally, beyond the Palestinians \u2013 for whom, by the way, they don't have a whole lot of use \u2013 have a view that this is a time to cultivate a relationship with Donald Trump, not precipitate conflict with him. I don't think they're going to have much truck with the Arab street blowing up.\"\n\n\"Here's the larger point: if Donald Trump, having made this commitment to Israel, backs away from it, that will be seen by the very radical Islamic terrorists that he has promised to eradicate from the face of the earth, as evidence that they can in fact extort him to submission. That's exactly the wrong message to send,\" Gaffney warned.\n\n\"I think it's time. I think that he can do it quite easily, actually. I believe the first order of business ought to be simply to change out the plaque in front of the consulate in Jerusalem. Call it an 'embassy.' It's a done deal on Day One,\" he advised. \"I think there may be histrionics, but I think they're eminently manageable. The symbolism is very important, both to Israel, and I think to potential adversaries.\"\n\nMarlow referred to the criticism Trump has taken for his \"America first\" policy, suggesting critics have willfully misinterpreted it to mean \"America only,\" and wondered if Trump would have difficulty sticking to such a dramatic change in U.S. policy outlook, or keeping his bold promise to \"eradicate radical Islamic terrorism from the face of the earth.\"\n\nGaffney said frankly that it would depend, in part, on \"whether he remains committed to the sorts of principles and guiding philosophy that he's laid out, not just in this particular context or in his inaugural address, but throughout the campaign.\"\n\nHe pointed to the decisions Trump was scheduled to announce today about \"restricting entry into this country against people who do not share our values, and who specifically may be trying to bring in this totalitarian sharia doctrine\" as a demonstration of the President's determination to stand by his campaign promises.\n\n\"I think if he hews to all of those principles, he's going to be fine. If he staffs his administration \u2013 this is the kicker \u2013 if he staffs his administration, not just at the Cabinet level, with people who hew to that line as well, he will be fine,\" Gaffney predicted.\n\n\"There is a concern, I have to tell you, among some of us that at lower levels, people who don't seem to share that are being considered, or actually given, appointments, and people who do share those principles are not,\" he added. \n\n\"So this is very much a work in progress. I believe Donald Trump is very clear-eyed on this. I think that a number of the people around him \u2013 our mutual friend Steve Bannon among them, Michael Flynn of course, the National Security adviser, General Mattis at the Defense Department, Rex Tillerson in his statements before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \u2013 they seem to get it,\" he said. \n\n\"We've got to make sure that they've got people below them who support and will faithfully execute the President's policy of protecting us against whatever you want to call it: radical Islamic terrorism, sharia supremacism, you pick your term. That's the mortal threat of our time. And by the way, it is present here in the form of the Muslim Brotherhood. I hope one of the early actions \u2013 a defining action of this President \u2013 will be that he designates the Muslim Brotherhood as what it is, a terrorist organization,\" said Gaffney.\n\nMarlow concluded by asking for Gaffney's take on the Syria peace talks currently being held in Kazakhstan under the auspices of Russia, Turkey, and Iran, but pointedly excluding the U.S. and its coalition partners from a major role.\n\n\"Well, we've seen this movie before,\" Gaffney replied. \"I'll be very surprised if the cease-fire has any duration to it at all. I think the truth of the matter is, what's happening on the ground, Alex, is that the people who have been fighting this civil war to this point, primarily, against the government of Syria \u2013 the Sunni Arabs \u2013 are being displaced. They're being replaced by Shiites from Iraq, in many cases, and elsewhere.\" \n\n\"You're going to see a population transfer that I think ultimately will cause this Syrian conflict to peter out \u2013 with the government of Assad still in power, the Russians in a stronger position, the Iranians of course in a much stronger position, having created what's been called a 'Shiite Crescent' from their own country all the way to the Mediterranean,\" he predicted. \"They're very important, and frankly very dangerous, strategic developments, but I think that's where this is headed.\"\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\u00a0to 9:00 a.m.\u00a0Eastern.\n\nListen to the audio of the full interview above.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.8125, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1474, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 8, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 7, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.27176004526, "HarmVirtue": 11, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 11, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 6, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 50, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170126050000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.3921302578018997, "mft_mean": 4.54545454545}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/jerusalem/2017/01/12/trump-secretary-of-state-pick-tillerson-slams-security-council-resolution-palestinian-violence-says-two-state-solution-still-aspiration/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Rex Tillerson: UN Resolution on Israel Undermines Conditions for Peace Talks", "wordcount_as_scraped": 613, "date": "20170112150000", "story_content": "TEL AVIV \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, slammed the Obama administration over its recent treatment of Israel at the UN, and added that while he supported the two-state solution, Palestinian terrorism was preventing peace.\n\nTillerson, who is the former CEO of ExxonMobil, said that direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians are still possible but the recent anti-settlement resolution at the UN Security Council \u2013 which the U.S. failed to veto \u2013 had made such a possibility more difficult.\n\n\u201cIsrael is, has always been, and remains our most important ally in the region,\u201d he said during his confirmation hearing with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cThe UN resolution that was passed, in my view, is not helpful.

Those include the following:\n\nSince that time, Breitbart Texas learned that now Sheriff-elect Sally Hernandez plans to remove Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from the Travis County jail when she takes office in January. \"I just don't think you solve the criminal justice process by deporting them,\" Hernandez\u00a0told The Texas Tribune\u00a0during a sit-down interview in her office. \"We talk about being progressive.

Governor Dan Patrick that ending sanctuary cities in Texas would be a priority for the 85th\u00a0Legislative Session which begins in January 2017.\n\n\"By electing a Republican president and Republican majorities in Congress, the American people made it clear that solving our illegal immigration crisis must be a priority,\" Senator Charles Perry (R-Lubbock) said in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. \"That starts by eliminating sanctuary cities, securing our border, and enforcing the immigration laws we currently have on the books. We cannot sit idly by and allow local policies to undercut efforts made at the federal and state level.\"\n\nThe five key provisions of Perry's SB 4 were discussed by the senator's staff with Breitbart Texas. Those provisions are:\n\nThe bill could face resistance in the Texas House. Speaker Joe Straus (R-San Antonio) told the Texas Tribune this week that only a \u201cconstructive\u201d bill would find open arms in the Texas House.

On the Colombian border, many Venezuelans in Western T\u00e1chira state do not look to stay: they cross the border whenever possible to buy food in neighboring C\u00facuta, Colombia. Dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s attempts to shut the border \u2013 including the expulsion of Colombian nationals in raids using what Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos described as \u201cnazi ghetto tactics\u201d \u2013 largely failed.\n\nThe Brazilian border, less populated and boasting a much more lush forest terrain, has been more difficult to secure. There, the\u00a0Washington Post estimates that 10,000 Venezuelans are crossing into Brazil on a monthly basis, most looking to buy food and medicine.\u00a0The booming markets in previously sleepy Pacaraima prompted Maduro to respond in the same way he did to C\u00facuta: shutting the border, claiming it a necessary measure against black market business.\n\nUnlike in Colombia, the Brazilian government is struggling to aid the flood of Venezuelans on its border.\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0reported last month that doctors working on the Venezuelan border are rapidly running out of supplies, morgues are overwhelmed with the bodies of the terminally ill looking for a last chance, and bordering\u00a0Roraima state was forced to declare a state of emergency.\n\nBrazilian officials, like their Colombian counterparts, have responded to the problem by urging Venezuela\u2019s socialist government to change its repressive policies. \"The immigration issue can only be fixed when you deal with the problem at the origin, not at the \u00addestination,\" Brazilian immigration official Gustavo Marrone lamented to the\u00a0Post.\n\nFurther north, in Mexico, Venezuelans are increasingly seeking work permits, or at least jobs. More Venezuelans sought work permits in Mexico in the past year than any other group, including Americans, Spaniards, Chinese, and Cubans, according to a report published in Mexican media in July. The number of migrants seeking work permits increased 20 percent between May and June 2016 alone.\n\nVenezuelans are now among the most populous applicants seeking asylum in the United States, as well. Pew reported in August that more than\u00a010,000 Venezuelans sought to move to the United States between October 2015 and June 2016, a 63 percent increase from the number in the same period a year before. Throughout the fiscal year 2016, the number of asylum requests from Venezuela increased\u00a0168 percent. And they are not choosing the obvious Latin American migrant destinations as homes, either; of particular note appears to be the burgeoning Venezuelan community in Utah.\n\nThose\u00a0the Utah\u00a0Daily Herald spoke to who moved to Utah were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (LDS), a minority in Venezuela. Just as they chose to use their religious identity as a compass, so, too, are Venezuelan Jews increasingly flocking to Israel to remake their lives. More than double the number of Venezuelans moved to Israel in 2015 than did in 2012, according to the\u00a0Washington Post.\u00a0\"I feel hopeful in Israel; it's a country filled with social innovation and opportunities,\" one of these migrants,\u00a0Reisy Abramof, told the\u00a0Post.\n\nVenezuelan nationals moving to the United States, Pew notes,\u00a0\u201chave higher levels of education than Hispanic immigrants overall\u201d and tend to be fluent in\u00a0English more often; similar statistics are not available for migrants to Israel, though the difficulty of traveling so far and the strict Israeli immigration laws may indicate a similar pattern exists. This may belie that poor Venezuelans appear to be fleeing the country as much as the better economically situated.\n\nMiami\u2018s El Nuevo Herald reported last week on a destination that appears to be taking in more of these Venezuelans: the Dominican Republic, where 170,000 Venezuelans moved to in 2016.\u00a0Many of those interviewed, the report notes, were once socialists. \u201cWe are a rich nation,\u201d lamented one Venezuelan while selling arepas, a type of corn bread, on a Dominican street. \u201cThis is an embarrassment. I never wanted to leave my country.\u201d\n\nStill more Venezuelans have taken to another Caribbean country: Trinidad and Tobago. The dual island nation\u2019s officials note that the actual\u00a0number of Venezuelans entering the country on tourist visas has dropped by half, while the number of Venezuelans living in the country appears to be increasing, a sign of increased illegal immigration. \u201cThe government\u2019s concern is that this deficit [of tourist visas] is entering illegally to stay,\u201d an expert tells\u00a0El Confidencial.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 17, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.817986965179441, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 847, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.8446954889, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 17, "mft_sum": 30, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170106120000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.5419126328217203, "mft_mean": 2.72727272727}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/12/15/womens-rights-groups-support-christian-jakarta-governor-trial-quran-joke/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [129, 369, 983, 1950, 2070, 2129, 2207, 2403, 2476, 2687, 2863, 3139, 3261, 3609]}}, "headline": "Christian Jakarta Governor Cries at Blasphemy Trial over Quran Joke", "wordcount_as_scraped": 616, "date": "20161216160000", "story_content": "Indonesian courts have commenced the trial of Jakarta Governor\u00a0Basuki \u201cAhok\u201d Tjahaja Purnama, facing charges of blasphemy for having joked about a paragraph in the Quran that implies Muslims should not be governed by non-Muslims.\n\nAhok is an ethnic Chinese Christian. A video of him delivering the joke\u00a0triggered a violent mob of 150,000 Indonesian Muslims to take the streets in November, demanding he be killed.\n\nPrior to the trial, Ahok, who is currently campaigning for reelection, apologized on multiple occasions.

He explained that his joke was meant to target Muslim politicians who use\u00a0Surah Al Maidah 51 to convince low-information voters to vote against better candidates who happen to not be Muslim.\n\nThe governor appeared to refer to Surah Al Maidah 5:51, which reads, \u201cO you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies.

The love of my adoptive parents for me, has inspired me to this day,\u201d he added amid tears, noting that his adoptive father was Muslim.\n\nThe\u00a0Jakarta Post reports that Ahok may lose his position as governor regardless of the trial outcome, at least temporarily.\u00a0\"If the court procures a letter explaining the charges and\u00a0maximum sentence that might be given to Ahok, the Home Affairs Ministry could\u00a0temporarily dismiss him,\u201d according to a Home Affairs Ministry official.\n\nAhok was charged as a \u201csuspect\u201d in the blasphemy case following the aforementioned mob riot demanding his death, in which\u00a0one person died. He is charged with violating an Indonesian statute that\u00a0prohibits \"religious abuse and/or defamation,\u201d which carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\nDespite the mob protests, Ahok remains extremely popular among Indonesian Christians and anti-Islamists generally.\u00a0\"I will keep supporting Pak Ahok who has been mistreated in this case. This is a character assassination committed by people who have ulterior motives,\" one supporter told the\u00a0Jakarta Post at an assembly of hundreds of supporters at his campaign headquarters Thursday. Another supporter, who identified herself as Muslim, insisted she did not \u201cfeel offended by Ahok\u2019s speech\u201d and accused his opponents of exploiting religion to sink his campaign.\n\nThe\u00a0Post also notes that a prominent women\u2019s rights group organized in front of Ahok\u2019s campaign headquarters to support Ahok.\u00a0\"We are ready to help the pair to disseminate their programs until they are elected,\" activist Saparinah Sadli said.\n\nIndonesia is the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority nation. Its politicians have used the blasphemy law with increasing frequency in recent memory, particularly to target anti-Islamic or Westernized liberal media. In 2014, the\u00a0Jakarta Post itself was charged with blasphemy for publishing an anti-Islamic State political cartoon. This year, Indonesia\u2019s broadcasting board attempted to censor Netflix due to anti-Islamic material available on the service and have attempted to push through a ban on \u201coffensive internet memes.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 3, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.21686744689941, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 591, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.0889318714700003, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 22, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161216160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.7225042301184397, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.0}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/news/us-sent-221-million-to-palestinians-in-obamas-last-hours/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "US sent $221 million to Palestinians in Obama\u2019s last hours", "wordcount_as_scraped": 551, "date": "20170123230000", "story_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Officials say the Obama administration in its waning hours defied Republican opposition and quietly released $221 million to the Palestinian Authority that GOP members of Congress had been blocking.\n\nA State Department official and several congressional aides said the outgoing administration formally notified Congress it would spend the money Friday morning. The official said former Secretary of State John Kerry had informed some lawmakers of the move shortly before he left the State Department for the last time Thursday. The aides said written notification dated Jan. 20 was sent to Congress just hours before Donald Trump took the oath of office.\n\nIn addition to the $221 million for the Palestinians, the Obama administration also told Congress on Friday it was going ahead with the release of another $6 million in foreign affairs spending, including $4 million for climate change programs and $1.25 million for U.N. organizations, the congressional aides said. The aides and the State Department official weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity.\n\nCongress had initially approved the Palestinian funding in budget years 2015 and 2016, but at least two GOP lawmakers \u2014 Ed Royce of California, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Kay Granger of Texas, who sits on the House Appropriations Committee \u2014 had placed holds on it over moves the Palestinian Authority had taken to seek membership in international organizations. Congressional holds are generally respected by the executive branch but are not legally binding after funds have been allocated.\n\nThe Obama administration had for some time been pressing for the release of the money for the Palestinian Authority, which comes from the U.S. Agency for International Development and is to be used for humanitarian aid in the West Bank and Gaza, to support political and security reforms as well as help prepare for good governance and the rule of law in a future Palestinian state, according to the notification sent to Congress.\n\nThe $1.25 million for U.N. agencies is to be used as voluntary contributions to the U.N. Peacebuilding Fund; the U.N. Special Coordinator on improving the U.N. response to sexual exploitation and abuse; the Montreal Protocol Secretariat, which oversees the protection of the ozone layer; the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights; and the U.N.

Trump has vowed to be a strong supporter of Israel and has invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to visit Washington next month.\n\nHe has also pledged to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, although White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Monday a final decision on that had yet to be made. Despite speculation in Israel that an announcement of the move is imminent, Spicer said the decision-making process is only in its very early stages.\n\n\u201cIf it was already a decision, then we wouldn\u2019t be going through a process,\u201d Spicer told reporters.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 2.04778146743774, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 537, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.6160353486, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 17, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170123230000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.1657355679702004, "mft_mean": 1.54545454545}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/jerusalem/2017/01/19/trumps-pick-un-envoy-slams-security-councils-anti-israel-resolution/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [736]}}, "headline": "Trump\u2019s UN Envoy Pick Nikki Haley Slams Security Council\u2019s Anti-Israel Resolution", "wordcount_as_scraped": 546, "date": "20170119150000", "story_content": "JERUSALEM \u2013 President-elect Donald J.

That is intimidating because it is something grandiose something incredible.\u201d\n\nPerhaps indicating that even the Cuban government suspects many will see through Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s indoctrination since being forced to return to Cuba, the young man directly addresses those who see his story as a tragic one in a live interview on the streets of Havana. \u201cI know what I lived,\u201d he tells the camera, \u201cI don\u2019t live an indoctrinated life, I don\u2019t live in a bubble.\u201d\n\n\u201cFidel taught me how to think, and when I had to decide, I decided for myself and I thought for myself,\u201d he asserts in a Cuban TV clip published by the Miami-based Cuban journalist Yusnaby P\u00e9rez.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez was 6 when his mother attempted to reach the United States from their native C\u00e1rdenas with him in tow on a makeshift vessel as\u00a0balseros, the word used for Cubans who take to the high seas hoping to reach Florida. His mother died in the attempt, but he reached land after being rescued by American fishermen. He spent several months in the United States before President Bill Clinton authorized a violent raid on the family home to extract the child and force him back into the arms of the communist dictatorship.\n\nOn the fifteenth anniversary of his saga, the great-uncle who cared for him, Delf\u00edn Gonz\u00e1lez, warned that the Cuban government had indoctrinated his young nephew.\u00a0\"It is not the boy's fault.

They\u2019re going to have to request an immigration status in Panama or in Costa Rica or anywhere else,\" Cochez told EFE.\n\nAsked about what would be a satisfactory solution for Panama, the former ambassador said that country needs to reach an agreement with the United States on the fate of the Cubans \"who are already here or in other countries.\"\n\nMeanwhile, other analysts, such as Nils Castro, Panama's former ambassador to Mexico, consider Obama's change in policy a relief for Central America, notes EFE.\n\nAccording to U.S. government figures, more than 45,000 Cubans made it to the U.S. mainland in 2016, including 41,000 across the Southwest border. The 2016 figure nearly doubles the 25,000 who entered the United States in 2014, before President Obama chose to reestablish diplomatic relations with Cuba\u2019s Communist Party.\n\nIn August 2016, the foreign ministers of Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama and Peru sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, urging the United States to \u201canalyze and revise\u201d its immigration policy towards Cuba, noting that it provides an \u201cincentive to the disorderly, illegal, unsafe flow of Cuban citizens.\u201d\n\nSeveral Spanish-language news outlets have reported on the \"despair\" and \"anguish\" among hundreds of stranded Cubans in Central America and Mexico who can no longer enter the United States because of Obama's concession to the Cuban government.\n\nJose Enrique Manresa, a 47-year-old who learned of the change in policy eight days before he had been expected to finish his journey to the United States, told BBC via telephone from Mexico, \"We lost everything. What hopes can I have if we can not go to the United States? \u201d\n\n\"It was not worth the whole trip we made \u2014 risking our lives, our health,\" he also said.\n\n\"There is a great sadness. Nobody ate today [Thursday],\" he added, referring to the other Cubans who are traveling with him. \"Everyone is desperate, calling their family.

Dana T. Rohrabacher, who chairs the House Foreign Relations Committee\u2019s subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats.\n\n\u201cIf I would be offered this job, I would take it\u2013not because I need to do it like so many people with an ego, such that they need to be secretary of state, but I do believe it would be my duty to jump into that and to take that job and that responsibility just for patriotic reasons,\u201d he said.\n\nRohrabacher grew up in a Marine family and did not settle down until his high school years outside of San Diego. In his life he has been a campus activist, a folk singer, and a\u00a0senior speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan. He also worked at a reporter and then an editorial writer for the Orange County Register.\n\nAmong his House colleagues, Rohrabacher is known most recently as the first congressman to call out Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R.-Wis.) during the speaker\u2019s anti-Trump Columbus Day conference call.\n\nOn the call, Ryan told the GOP congressmen that they needed to separate themselves from Trump in the aftermath of the release of a lewd 2005 audio tape of Trump speaking in a direct way about his courtship of a married woman and about women who want to spend time with celebrities.\u00a0Rohrabacher told Ryan he was disloyal to the party and the party\u2019s nominee, which sparked an uproar in the membership that forced the speaker to back away from his disavowal of Trump.\n\n\u201cIt just so happens that Donald Trump and I agree on the major foreign policy decisions that will have to be made,\u201d he said.\n\nRohrabacher said that central to his view of American foreign policy is the development of a quartet of nations, led by the United States, to grow the world economy, combat terrorism, and check the influence and power of China.\n\nIn the congressman\u2019s view, Japan, India, Russia, and the United States share common interests, common rivals, and by working together would fashion a more peaceful and prosperous world.\n\nThis quartet would function as a global alliance, he said, adding, \u201cLet\u2019s take a look at China.\u201d\n\nThe only way to impress upon the Chinese leaders that their intimidation of their neighbors must stop is to present them with an overwhelming force and power that they know they can never match, Rohrabacher said.\u00a0\u201cThe United States is no longer in a position to do that alone.\u201d\n\nPresident Barack Obama made a cornerstone of his foreign policy a pivot towards Asia and to rebrand the U.S.\u00a0as a Pacific power.\u00a0Rohrabacher said the pivot was an attempt to meet the challenge from China, but China is now more emboldened because Obama\u2019s pivot was so poorly executed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to think of anything of substance in Obama\u2019s supposed pivot to Asia\u2013I didn\u2019t see anything of substance at all and I am sure the Chinese did not,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThus, if you have a President of the United States beating his chest and suggesting some major foreign policy maneuver and then there\u2019s nothing, that\u2019s going to do nothing but encourage the Chinese,\u201d he said.\n\nRohrabacher said America should embrace its position as a Pacific power through partnerships with India, Japan, and Russia, which is very much a Pacific power, as well.\n\n\u201cIndia and Japan are major powers in the world\u2013right now\u2013and their potential is enormous,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf we are working with them and we have a workable coalition with them, that is something that would balance off the dynamics at play with an expanding China,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cJapan has a very strong economy that is quite often overlooked, and it so often overlooked as a force in the world because it is so peaceful,\u201d Rohrabacher said.\n\nFor its first 30 years of independence, India was frozen economically and diplomatically by the legacy of English socialism that stifled its natural culture of enterprise and locked it into a quasi-alliance with the Soviet Union and anti-American countries, he said.\n\nIndia is particularly poised to grow into a world power, he said.\n\n\u201cIndia has that kind of potential. With the right policies, India will have the same economic growth we have seen in China,\u201d the congressman said. \u201cIts people have incredible entrepreneurial and technological skills and talents.\u201d\n\nOne of the sticking points to any coalition involving Russia and the United States is the question of how to unwind the entanglement of Russia with Ukraine over the Russian seizing of Crimea and other Ukrainian territories.\n\nRohrabacher said he proposes a fair and monitored referendum in Crimea to resolve the situation with Crimeans joining Russia, rejoining Ukraine, or going independent.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is that the United States should not be dictating things like this,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, the Californian said in the areas in eastern Ukraine, where the Russians and their confederates have moved in to seize control other than in Crimea, Russia must back out. \u201cThat is not acceptable.\u201d\n\nThe former speechwriter said Trump understands that the world has changed since the end of the Cold War, but American foreign policy and the factors that go into making foreign policy have been held over from that era.\n\n\u201cTrump would be the first president to come to power in total opposition to that dynamic that has governed us since the beginning of the Cold War,\u201d he said.\n\nBecause of his election mandate and the platform he ran on, the incoming president has the leeway to try things that were totally unacceptable to the foreign policy establishment throughout the world, he said.\n\n\u201cThat is really significant because the foreign policy establishment that has been in place for decades is disintegrating and it has not been able to meet the challenges,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNew alliances, like a grand alliance with the United States with Russia, Japan and India could well do more to preserve the peace and the stability of the world and secure our freedom\u2013especially against radical Islam and China\u2013than any of the old alliances could because the old alliances are not useful in meeting today\u2019s challenges\u2013compared to what they did 40 years ago.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.34334763884544395, "HarmVice": 2, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1025, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 1, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.209395237380001, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 11, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 43, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161125170000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.9090909090900006, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 4.19512195121951, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/11/23/cuba-communist-military-march-trump/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e9": [1338, 2969], "\u00a0": [575, 621, 684, 1013, 1304, 1315, 1358, 1513, 2683, 2690, 2965, 3383, 3613, 3998], "\u00f1": [3808, 3986], "\u00fa": [652], "\u00ed": [1356, 3388]}}, "headline": "Cuba Orders North Korea-Style \u2018Fighting People\u2019s March\u2019 Following Military Exercises", "wordcount_as_scraped": 657, "date": "20161124070000", "story_content": "The communist government of Cuba has announced a \u201cFighting People\u2019s March\u201d in Havana on December 2 to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Castro brothers landing in Cuba after fleeing a confrontation with Fulgencio Batista\u2019s forces.\n\nThe march follows the completion of \u201cmilitary exercises\u201d announced immediately after the U.S. presidential election of Donald Trump, who made opposition to human rights violations in Cuba a cornerstone of his Latin America foreign policy.\n\nThe Spain-based\u00a0Diario de Cuba cites state propaganda outlets\u00a0as announcing that dictator Ra\u00fal Castro had decreed December 2\u00a0a national holiday \u2014 a \u201cNational Day of Defense\u201d \u2014 in order to maximize attendance at national marches. \u201cCubans are pressured by political organizations in their places of employment, study, and their neighborhoods to participate in these marches,\u201d the newspaper notes.\n\nThe march will mark the anniversary of the landing of the\u00a0Granma, a boat the Castro brothers and mass murderer Ernesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara, along with some close allies, navigated out of Mexico into Cuba. By the time the communist revolutionaries landed in Cuba once again, the leaders of the true opposition to President Batista \u2014 urban guerrilla leader\u00a0Frank Pais\u00a0and student leader Jos\u00e9 Antonio Echeverr\u00eda\u00a0\u2014 had completed most of the work of dismantling Batista\u2019s regime but perished in their efforts. As Yale professor Carlos Eire explains, the landing of the\u00a0Granma was largely a failure:\n\n\u2026[A]fter begging for money from exiles in the United States and living off the work or the fortunes of others, Fidel, Raul, an Argentine scumbag they called \"Che\" and a handful of fellow \"revolutionaries\" landed in eastern Cuba in a boat named Granma, and, once again, Fidel and Raul managed to get nearly everyone in the expedition killed. The brothers and the Argentine survived, mostly by avoiding all confrontations with their enemies and letting everyone else do the fighting. They headed for the mountains, met up later with a New York Times reporter named Herbert Matthews and managed to draw all attention to themselves and their 26th of July Movement, even though there were many other \"revolutionaries\" fighting against Batista, much more effectively, with much nobler goals.\n\nThe celebration of this historical event follows the conclusion of the 2016 \u201cBastion Strategic Exercises,\u201d announced in response to Trump\u2019s election to the White House. The exercises were allegedly meant to \u201csimulate the struggle against the enemy landing within defensible territory\u201d on the island, according to the state newspaper also named Granma.\u00a0Granma\u00a0published multiple updates on the exercises that did little to explain the need for such exercises, particularly in light of the cordial visit President Barack Obama made to the island in March.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a way for us to prepare ourselves to defend the nation,\u201d Sergeant\u00a0Jos\u00e9 Antonio Pedraza Caballero is quoted as saying, without explaining what Cuba needs to defend itself from. \u201cConfronting the adversary and defeating them is our mission, and we are equipped to achieve it, as we have proven today.\u201d\n\nCuban state television propagandists also appeared on television in military outfits, and civilians were encouraged to dress in military garb to support the troops.\n\n\n\nThe Miami-based\u00a0Mart\u00ed Noticias agency reports, however, that those on the island appeared little enthusiastic about the exercises.\n\n\u201cI saw absolutely nobody in my neighborhood wearing green, absolutely nobody in military garb, absolutely nobody \u00a0mobilizing for the War of All People,\u201d dissident Witner Ballester told the agency from Cuba. \u201cThe only war here is against the hunger that is killing the Cuban people.\u201d\n\nDissident Guillermo Fari\u00f1as, an EU Sakharov Prize winner who has completed 24 hunger strikes against the regime, argued that the target of these exercises is not Donald Trump, but the Cuban people. Fari\u00f1as told the\u00a0Diario de Cuba that the Cuban government is \u201cvery nervous since Obama achieved so much popularity, even within the Communist Party.

Trump are a minority in the Bay Area. But they decided to fight back in Santa Clara, which includes Silicon Valley, where the county board of supervisors passed a virulently anti-Trump resolution on Tuesday.\n\nThe resolution, which came on the eve of Trump\u2019s meeting with tech leaders,\u00a0is one of several such measures that Democrat-controlled local governments have taken in the weeks since Trump won the election. It states, in part (original emphasis):\n\nWHEREAS, Donald J. Trump is poised to become the 45th President of the United States of America, notwithstanding his loss of the popular vote by over 2 million votes; and\nWHEREAS, the President-Elect has repeatedly made statements offensive to women, immigrants, religious minorities, racial and ethnic minorities, veterans, the disabled, the LGBTQ community, and the general public; and\nWHEREAS, the President-Elect has threatened to create a registry of Muslim Americans, to bar all Muslims from entering the country, to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, to build a wall on the country\u2019s border with Mexico, to impose an ideological test for entry to the United States, and to withhold federal funds from sanctuary cities; and\nWHEREAS, the President-Elect has promised to repeal federal regulations protecting LGBTQ individuals; to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which ensures health coverage for millions of Americans; to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement; and to remove environmental protections put in place by President Obama\u2019s administration \u2026\nNOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Supervisors of the County of Santa Clara, State of California, that Santa Clara County unequivocally rejects the politics of fear and hate, which have divided our fellow Americans; and\nvar _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([\"embed\"]);BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that Santa Clara County continues to embrace all people, regardless of their skin color, country of birth, faith, sex, gender, partners, or abilities; and \u2026\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that Santa Clara County shall resist any and all efforts to profile undocumented immigrants or report them to the federal government for immigration enforcement, and \u2026\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that Santa Clara County will continue to promote civility, honesty, truthfulness, and mutual respect in all areas of civil and political discourse; and\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that Santa Clara County calls on members of our community to hew to our values as Americans; to be vigilant against attacks on those values; to protect one another; to overcome the politics of fear and hate; to bridge our divides; to stay informed and engaged; to participate in our great democracy; and to set an example for the rest of our nation \u2026\n\nIronically, Santa Clara County was the site of the worst anti-Trump violence of the entire campaign, where Trump supporters leaving a rally in San Jose in June were beaten, bloodied and chased through the streets in full view of the national media. The mayor of San Jose, Sam Liccardo, actually blamed Trump for the violence, saying that Trump\u2019s rhetoric had invited the attacks: \u201cAt some point Donald Trump needs to take responsibility for the irresponsible behavior of his campaign,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors passed the resolution, with three votes in favor and two abstentions, the\u00a0San Jose Mercury News reports \u2014 but not before receiving complaints from the minority of Trump supporters in the county.\n\nOne e-mailed comment, from San Jose resident Jerry Mungai, read as follows:\n\nSupervisor [Dave] Cortese's proposed resolution responding to the 2016 presidential election is filled with inaccuracies, half- truths that would require several pages to rebut.\nI wish to make several points, however.\nSupervisor Cortese mentions, as does the mainstream media unrelentingly, that Donald Trump lost the popular vote; but he fails to point out that the Constitution requires a candidate to win the Electoral College (EC) vote. Candidate Clinton was so certain she would win the EC vote that she chose to ignore visiting key EC states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan.\nWith all the intellectual and financial resources available to her, she should have campaigned in such a manner as to assure victory in those states. She chose not to. More importantly, her message was unappealing to the voters. Have you noticed how the stock market is reacting to the Trump victory?\nSupervisor Cortese deplores some Trump comments about women; but I don't recall him condemning Hollywood's movies that are laced with vulgar language, explicit sex scenes and deplorable treatment of women.\nCortese chooses to ignore the fact that Trump won more votes from women, Latinos and blacks than Romney won in 2012; and key advisors included members of the LGBTQ (e.g. Peter Thiel), women (Kellyanne Conway) and black (Ben Carson) communities. He also ignores the fact that Trump is selecting women (Elaine Chao & Betsy DeVos) and blacks (Carson) for his cabinet. In selecting cabinet candidates he looks for the best person to help America thrive, IRRESPECTIVE of skin color or gender! In other words, he promotes equal opportunity over equal results. He looks for those who can transcend entrenched bureaucracy and deliver promised results and help all Americans to thrive.\nHe also promises, most importantly, to uphold the rule of law, like protecting our borders. ALL Americans support LEGAL immigration; condoning illegal immigration is a slap in the face to those who follow our rules! And this proposed resolution is also a slap in the face of those who obey the law.\nI respectfully urge the Supervisors to reject Supervisor Cortese's proposed resolution in response to the 2016 presidential election.\n\nAnother\u00a0Trump supporter, Edward Sattler, wrote:\n\nI have different views than this Resolution and want to be represented too. \u2026\nThe rhetoric of the Resolution speaks about hate crimes, but does not include the Trump supporters who were surrounded, repeatedly violently attacked, chased, and left blood spattered in an ugly display after they attended a Trump Rally here in San Jose. Twenty-four people reported assaults, but only 20 people were arrested. This resolution also does not include mention of attacks on Trump supporters in schools and communities after the election. There have been many. \u2026\nI suggest we accept the election results and the fact that vast portions of the United States may have some or many views that are different from Santa Clara County. Does that make them bad, immoral, or despicable? I don\u2019t think so. Our great country was build from many peoples of differing views all working to build a better life for themselves and make our country better. Lets set this ill-conceived Resolution aside, stop wasting taxpayer dollars and time, and get back to the business of improving Santa Clara County.\n\nThere were also comments in favor of the resolution.\n\nJoel B.

Events both locally and nationally have demonstrated a need for Texas State University to strengthen its commitment to diversity,\u201d states the\u00a0petition.\n\nThe document embraces the typical go-to buzzwords of ardent social justice warriors, calling the campus a \u201cHispanic Serving Institution\u201d that values a diverse population, inclusiveness, a global perspective, and a sense of community. The petitioners support DACA protections. They criticize Texas State officials over hypothetical future actions that could repeal and deport the illegal immigrant students enrolled through the DACA program.\n\nNationally, the U.S. president-elect and his administration have discussed deporting millions,\u00a0creating a national registry for Muslims, and repealing\u00a0the Obama administration\u2019s order on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Texas State University\u2019s administration has not adequately communicated how it will respond if such actions occur.\u201d\nThe lack of communication regarding DACA is particularly concerning. Undocumented students with DACA are extraordinarily vulnerable due to the information they have provided to the government. The DACA order safeguards students from deportation, grants them work authorization, and enables them to obtain drivers\u2019 licenses. While it is unclear whether or how quickly government agencies will take action against students with DACA status, the potential threat of deportation will certainly have deleterious effects upon individuals and the university community at large.\n\nThe petitioners assert that university administrators and the Associated Student Government must take action to remedy their commitment to diversity by declaring the campus \u201ca sanctuary for undocumented students, workers, and community members\u201d and refuse to release student information to anyone. They also want\u00a0policies that allow DACA students, if arrested, detained, and/or deported, to complete their college degrees online.\n\nAlthough the crux of the petition leans heavily on protecting DACA students, the Texas State U. newspaper traced\u00a0the document\u2019s inception to \u201chostility and hate speech\u201d on campus and recent threatening \u201cvigilante\u201d fliers posted on campus\u00a0attributed\u00a0to alleged Trump supporters and an unrelated student\u2019s tragic suicide. For this, petitioners request the university shores up protections, counseling services, and advocacy networks to better serve \u201cunderrepresented\u201d student body populations\u00a0such as \u201cimmigrants, blacks,\u00a0LGBTQIA, Muslims\u2026\u201d\n\nThe petitioners task the Associated Student Government with creating a committee that would devise multiple unspecified solutions address\u00a0\u201cthe needs and concerns of vulnerable populations affected by potential immigration policies.\u201d This think-tank would report its findings to the student body in a timely manner and must enact the best policies while complying with the university\u2019s legal obligations.\n\nOn Tuesday, petitioners presented the signed document to university President Denise Trauth at a Bobcat United Roundtable hosted by the student government, according to the University Star. Student Julia Estrada, president of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), attended and told the campus newspaper: \u201cAs a Latino-serving institution devoted to diversity, it should be our objective to represent all students, including undocumented ones.\u201d\n\nThe push for sanctuary campus\u00a0status comes in response to President-Elect Donald Trump\u2019s immigration proposals that include building a wall along the U.S. southern border and banning sanctuary cities, also a longstanding priority for Texas lawmakers. Lt. Governor Dan Patrick placed it as a top initiative for the state\u2019s upcoming 85th Legislature. Breitbart Texas recently\u00a0reported\u00a0state Senator Charles Perry (R-Lubbock) filed SB 4, a bill to eliminate sanctuary cities in the Lone Star State.\n\nLast year, Governor Greg Abbott signed\u00a0into law the toughest border security bill of any U.S. state. He called\u00a0for the end of sanctuary cities in Texas after admonishing a\u00a0Dallas County Sheriff for easing\u00a0back on immigration holds for jailed immigrants. Abbott made clear sanctuary city policies will \u201cno longer be tolerated in Texas.\u201d\n\nFollow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on\u00a0Twitter.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.893997430801392, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 690, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 10, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.158035136740001, "HarmVirtue": 7, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 41, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161201140000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.72727272727, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 5.94202898550725, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/11/03/sen-charles-grassley-requests-state-dept-ig-investigate-clinton-podesta-kadzik-mcauliffe-conflicts-of-interest/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1274, 1918, 2762, 2912, 2953, 2954, 2956, 3035, 3036, 3038, 3123, 3271, 3272, 3274, 3449, 3450, 3452, 3550, 3625, 3696, 3697, 3699, 3787, 3788, 3790, 3944, 3997, 5096, 5287, 5378, 5830, 6304, 6763], "\u00a7": [5402]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 977, "scraper_regex": 1099}}, "headline": "Sen.

Horowitz, the State Department\u2019s inspector general, with his own catalog:\n\nAs the senior official in the Office of Legislative Affairs, Mr. Kadzik is being allowed to participate in decisions about what information on these matters will be disclosed to Congressional oversight committees. \u00a0Reports have noted that Mr. Kadzik continues a very close relationship with John Podesta, the Chairman of Secretary Clinton's presidential campaign. \u00a0For instance, news reports have noted:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Mr. Kadzik represented Mr. Podesta during the Monica Lewinsky investigation.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Mr. Kadzik lobbied Mr. Podesta for then-President Bill Clinton to pardon Marc Rich. \u00a0On this point, the House Committee on Government Reform found that Mr. Kadzik was hired by Marc Rich because of his connections with Mr. Podesta.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Mr. Podesta emailed Obama campaign officials to recommend Mr. Kadzik for a role in the Obama campaign and called Mr. Kadzik a \"fantastic lawyer\" that \"kept me out of jail.\"\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Mr. Kadzik met with Mr. Podesta for dinner one day after Secretary Clinton's Benghazi testimony. \u00a0Mr. Kadzik also met at Mr. Podesta's home for dinner on January 13, 2016. \u00a0During both times the FBI was still investigating Secretary Clinton.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0On May 5, 2015, Mr. Kadzik's son asked Mr. Podesta for a job on the Clinton campaign.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0On May 19, 2015, Mr. Kadzik emailed Mr. Podesta and warned, \"[t]here is a HJC oversight hearing today where the head of our Civil Division will testify. \u00a0Likely to get questions on State Department emails. \u00a0Another filing in the FOIA case went in last night or will go in this am that indicates it will be awhile (2016) before the State Department posts the emails.\"\n\n\u201cGiven these facts, Mr. Kadzik's relationship with the Clintons and their associates is incompatible with the ability of Congress to have any confidence in his ability to be fair and impartial in advising on decisions about how to respond to Congressional oversight inquiries related to these matters,\u201d the senator wrote.\n\nThen, there is the case of Andrew McCabe, the number two man at the Federal Bureau of Investigations, who was previously the agent-in-charge of the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office.\n\nThe Iowa senator requested information about the circumstances of the G-Man\u2019s wife, Dr. Jill McCabe, who received massive support from the governor of Virginia and the chairman of Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential run for the doctor\u2019s own 2015 campaign for state senate.\n\nGrassley wrote:\n\nAt the FBI, Mr. McCabe's wife accepted more than half a million dollars from entities associated with Gov. Terry McAuliffe for her political campaign. \u00a0Given Gov. McAuliffe's ties to the Clintons and the control Mr. McCabe later exerted over the Clinton investigation, some have suggested that there is at least the appearance of a conflict. \u00a0All government employees must avoid situations that create the appearance of impropriety. \u00a0Specifically, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2635.502, advises that a government employee should seek clearance before participating in any matter that could cause his or her impartiality to be questioned.\n\nThe chairman must have wondered where it all ends, when he wrote: \u201cAgainst the backdrop of these apparent conflicts, the public has also learned that the Justice Department entered into unusual immunity agreements with all of Secretary Clinton's close associates. \u00a0These immunity agreements inexplicably limited the scope in which the FBI could review relevant emails.\u201d\n\nTypically, the Justice Department trades immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony and or information that leads to someone\u2019s prosecution and conviction.\n\nIn the case of the Clinton private email scandal, there were plenty of immunity deals, but no prosecution, especially after the FBI decided to put guard rails on its probe, focusing on the Espionage Act\u00a0and ignoring all other possible violations of the law.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the public now knows that the investigation's scope was arbitrarily limited to classifications issues, with little or no effort to make a case against anyone for intentionally alienating federal records to subvert the Freedom of Information Act process and potentially obstruct Congress,\u201d said Grassley.\n\n\u201cIn light of all of this, an independent, objective, non-partisan review is vital. \u00a0The American people deserve to know whether political considerations have improperly affected the handling of this inquiry and understand why key officials failed to recuse themselves to protect the public's confidence in a fair and impartial inquiry based on merits and the evidence rather than on politics,\u201d the senator said.\n\nThe senator, who is considered Capitol Hill\u2019s top guardian angel of government whistle blowers, requested a response by Nov. 7.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 0, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.25575447082519503, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 977, "FairnessVirtue": 11, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.17531803574, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161104060000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.14943705220061, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/01/03/president-trump-can-free-2nd-amendment-ninth-circuits-grip/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [451, 472, 1047, 1199, 1513, 1929, 2009]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 587, "scraper_regex": 622}}, "headline": "President Trump Can Free Second Amendment from Ninth Circuit\u2019s Grip", "wordcount_as_scraped": 622, "date": "20170103200000", "story_content": "The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has been chipping away at the Second Amendment for years, but when he takes office, President Donald Trump can limit the ramifications of their decisions\u2013actually reversing them in some instances\u2013by appointing the pro-Second Amendment, pro-Constitution justice he pledged to appoint while running for office.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit\u00a0ruled on December 14\u00a0that it is constitutional for a state to require residents who pass a background check to then wait ten days before being allowed to take possession of the gun they wish to purchase. The court suggested this ten-day waiting period provides a \u201ccooling-off period,\u201d a theory that is moot in light of the fact that the ten-day wait applies to California residents who already own guns, too. That is, Californians who already own guns and are simply seeking a new one have to wait ten days as if it were the first gun they ever purchased.\n\nOn June 9, the Ninth Circuit had taken\u00a0an even more egregious swipe at the Second Amendment by ruling that Americans have no right to carry a concealed gun outside the home for self-defense.\u00a0Judge Williams Fletcher wrote, \"We hold that the Second Amendment does not preserve or protect a right of a member of the general public to carry concealed firearms in public.\" This ruling not only undercut concealed carry as a right, but also upheld California\u2019s \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement, which was challenged in\u00a0Peruta v. San Diego County. It means Californians cannot simply carry a gun because they have a God-given right to keep and bear arms. Rather, they are allowed to carry only if they show their state government \u201cgood cause\u201d for so doing and the state government approves.\n\nNotably, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in favor of the \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement came as a result of a reversal, wherein the court reheard Peruta\u00a0after originally ruling against the \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement. Even more notable\u00a0is the fact that the Ninth\u2019s original ruling against \u201cgood cause\u201d explained the court\u2019s position that upholding the requirement would demonstrate failure to truly grasp the Second Amendment.\n\nAs the NRA\u2019s America\u2019s 1st Freedom observes:\n\nThe original Ninth Circuit ruling in Peruta had noted the many disagreements taking place in the courts over the Second Amendment: \"Our reading of the Second Amendment is akin to the Seventh Circuit's interpretation \u2026 and at odds with the approach of the Second, Third, and Fourth Circuits. \u2026 We are unpersuaded by the decisions of the Second, Third, and Fourth Circuits for several reasons. First, contrary to the approach in Heller, all three courts declined to undertake a complete historical analysis of the scope and nature of the Second Amendment right outside the home. \u2026 As a result, they misapprehend both the nature of the Second Amendment right and the implications of state laws that prevent the vast majority of responsible, law-abiding citizens from carrying in public for lawful self-defense purposes.\"\nSuch is the fight for freedom now taking place in many courts. Some of these cases will likely, at some point, make their way to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nDuring the October 9 presidential debate, Trump stated that he was running to save the Second Amendment from \u201cpeople like Hillary Clinton.\u201d To do so, he pledged to put forward a nominee \u201cin the mold of Antonin Scalia.\u201d By nominating such an individual, Trump will also save the Second Amendment from the Ninth Circuit\u2019s grip.\n\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of \"Bullets with AWR Hawkins,\" a Breitbart News podcast.

Tying \"high standards\" to school choice is also troubling, because this is again bureaucrat-speak for \"requiring all private schools to teach Common Core using the control mechanism of tests.\"\nWhen DeVos touts \"school choice,\" she's pushing an education agenda that includes\u00a0requiring all the schools that take voucher money to use state-determined curriculum, like Common Core. This is how she has used her millions of dollars in the past. If she's education secretary, we have every reason to believe it's how she'd use even more power.\n\nOn what appears to be a new website, DeVos answers a question about whether she can \"provide some straight talk\" on the topic of Common Core. She responds:\n\nCertainly. I am not a supporter\u2014period.\nI do support high standards, strong accountability, and local control. When Governors such as\u00a0John Engler, Mike Huckabee, and Mike Pence were driving the conversation on voluntary high standards driven by local voices, it all made sense.\nHave organizations that I have been a part of supported Common Core? Of course. But that's not my position. Sometimes it's not just students who need to do their homework.\nHowever, along the way, it got turned into a federalized boondoggle.\n\nMany of you are asking about Common Core. To clarify, I am not a supporter\u2014period. Read my full stance, here: https://t.co/qB2nAXvX0B\n\u2014 Betsy DeVos (@BetsyDeVos) November 23, 2016\n\n\n\nGov. Mike Huckabee and now Vice President-elect Mike Pence both got into hot water with anti-Common Core activists as well. Huckabee became known for recommending that the Common Core standards simply be \"rebranded\" with a different name since the reform had grown so politically \"toxic.\"\n\nGov. Pence apparently heeded Huckabee's advice and then drew the ire of parents in his state of Indiana when he turned around and approved a \"rebrand\" of Common Core soon after achieving a repeal of the standards.\n\nIt's not clear how DeVos can respond \"certainly\" and with a definitive \"period\" that she does not support Common Core when she never articulated such views against it in the past, or came to the aid of parents fighting the \"boondoggle\" in her state of Michigan.\n\nThough DeVos minimizes her associations with pro-Common Core organizations, they are readily visible and most would assume if she gives considerable financial and time and talent support to a group of people, she probably believes what they believe.\n\nAs a member of the board of Jeb Bush's national education foundation, DeVos was likely aware that the \"reform agenda\" of the organization she has been helping to guide includes college and career readiness; digital learning; utilizing student standardized assessment to determine teacher performance ratings; outcome-based funding; and standards and accountability \u2013 which include \"high academic standards with their progress measured.\" This agenda is nearly identical to that of the Common Core \"reform\" and is what Bush's foundation has sought to thrust upon the nation.\n\nAnd Bush has been an ardent supporter of the Core in other ways. Another of his education groups \u2013 Chiefs for Change \u2013 a bipartisan coalition of state education chiefs \u2013 consisted of some members who were also members of the PARCC Common Core test consortium \u2013 one of the two federally funded interstate groups that developed tests aligned with the Common Core standards.\n\nA report at the Detroit News in July states that DeVos was also an at-large delegate for pro-Common Core Ohio Gov. John Kasich.\n\nKasich \u2013 like Jeb Bush \u2013 received a grade of \"F\" at The Pulse 2016 for his support of the controversial standards. The Ohio governor referred to parent activists in his state fighting against the Core as a \"runaway internet campaign,\" just as Bush said Republicans didn't need anti-Common Core conservatives to win the White House.\n\nBuzzfeed also reported DeVos has \"close ties to many on Capitol Hill\" and \"is closely aligned to Republican education officials like Sen. Lamar Alexander,\" an association that is not likely to endear her to grassroots parent activists. Alexander rammed through a massive \"bipartisan\" bill to replace No Child Left Behind that gives the U.S. Education Secretary significant control over standards and testing. President Barack Obama took such a liking to Alexander's legislation that he signed it immediately into law last December, praising it as a \"Christmas miracle.\"\n\nPullmann observes about DeVos' claim she is \"certainly\" not a Common Core supporter:\n\nThat's sure news to all the grassroots folks she\u00a0pit her big money against\u00a0during their legislative battles to reject Common Core. Grassroots folks report to me that DeVos' husband personally called state senators in Michigan to get them to vote against a Common Core repeal bill. DeVos' American Federation for Children also contributed\u00a0huge sums of money\u00a0for state school board races in Alabama on the side of Common Core supporters trying to oust Common Core opponents.\n\nNot so brilliant when she was championing Common Core. If she's a figurehead, who will really run the show? Parents need to know. https://t.co/OwyXnot0kp\n\u2014 Michelle Malkin (@michellemalkin) November 23, 2016\n\n\n\nMichigan parent activist Karen Braun tells Breitbart News DeVos never used any of her time or wealth to assist parents in her state in their efforts to repeal Common Core. \"DeVos prefers to be out of the limelight and let others like the Great Lakes Education Project (GLEP) do the heavy lifting,\" Braun says. \"But activists and lawmakers in Michigan know her pro-Common Core position very well.\"\n\nShe continues:\n\nI had a discussion with former Michigan State Representative Tom McMillin about the DeVos appointment.\u00a0He and I worked closely to try and get Common Core out of Michigan.\u00a0He said he had a terse conversation with her in 2013 in the heat of our efforts to repeal Common Core \u2026 she was very clear she loved Common Core and all the high-stakes testing and central planning.\u00a0Her recent statement claiming to be against it is disingenuous. She never did anything to help the efforts to get rid of Common Core and did many things behind the scenes to hinder us.\u00a0We have a repeal and replace bill in Michigan that GLEP opposes and have worked over lawmakers to make sure it doesn\u2019t pass.\u00a0We\u2019ve done our homework and we know that DeVos is pro-Common Core despite any statement she puts out today.\n\nShane Vander Hart at Truth in American Education confirms, \"Former Michigan State Representative Tom McMillin said to me, '[DeVos] and GLEP were one of the main leaders defending Common Core when I was fighting it in the legislature. In 2013 I know she was strongly supportive of Common Core and high stakes testing.\"\n\nPerhaps parent activists can take heart that DeVos has suddenly turned over a new leaf and is now against Common Core and the federal control of education it represents since her new boss says he is committed to its demise.\n\nIn that case, talk of \"nationalized high standards\" will need to disappear, and instead take a turn toward Trump's plan to finally dismantle the U.S. Department of Education and return education policy to the states and local school districts where the Constitution says it belongs.\n\n\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 18, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.587544083595276, "HarmVice": 3, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1561, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 11, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.648081660730001, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 18, "mft_sum": 34, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "timestamp": 20161124170000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 3.0909090909099994, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 1, "pct_mft_words": 2.17809096732864, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/01/25/john-bolton-moving-u-s-embassy-jerusalem-simple-moving-sign-one-building-another/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [428, 6914, 9497, 9510]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1541, "scraper_regex": 1629}}, "headline": "John Bolton: Moving U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem as Simple as Moving the Sign from One Building to Another", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1629, "date": "20170126050000", "story_content": "Former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Wednesday's edition of Breitbart News Daily to discuss the prospective relocation of America's Israel embassy to Jerusalem.\n\nBolton said he was \"concerned that the pace appears to have slowed down\" on the subject of moving America\u2019s embassy to Jerusalem.\u00a0\n\nLISTEN:\n\n\n\n\"I think one of the things that distinguished Donald Trump, and you can see it even in his first days in office, is during the campaign he said 'I'm going to do X, Y, and Z' \u2013 and miraculous to behold, he's actually doing it on so many different fronts, internationally and domestically,\" he said. \n\n\"The kind of exception, at this point, appears to be moving the embassy. As I think we've commented before, you can move the embassy by taking the plaque off the wall at our consulate building in Jerusalem and putting up a sign that says 'U.S. Embassy.' You can build a bigger embassy, the full-scope embassy, obviously over a longer period of time, but you could make the dramatic move quickly,\" Bolton argued.\n\n\"I very much fear that what's happening is that foreign countries, the State Department, maybe some inside the administration are saying, 'Oh, but it's going to cause difficulties. People are threatening to riot. It'll hurt the interests of Israel and the United States,' and this and that and the other thing, which is what they say every time this issue comes up,\" he said. \n\n\"But once you slow down, once you miss the chance to strike dramatically in the early days \u2013 and there's a diplomatic phrase for that, of course, in French we say 'making it a fait accompli,' an accomplished fact \u2013 once you give up that opportunity, the cost actually mounts. And so we'll see what happens. We'll know more, I think, when Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel comes in the next few weeks, and see what he and the President discuss,\" Bolton anticipated.\n\nHe allowed that moving the embassy \"would certainly necessitate a lot of active diplomacy to calm down people who might be concerned about it,\" but said reneging on Trump's stated commitment to the move would be tantamount to \"allowing other people, in other countries, to tell us who we talk to, where we put our embassy.\"\n\nFor that reason, Bolton thought Trump did a \"fantastic thing when he took a congratulatory phone call from Tsai Ing-wen, the president of Taiwan\" \u2013 an unprecedented move that caused \"a lot of heart murmurings in some quarters, and upset Beijing, heaven forbid.\"\n\n\"Here is a case where the United States, for years, has let Beijing tell us who we could talk to in Taiwan. Just think about that for a minute. And now we have other governments telling us where we can put our embassy in Israel. Can they tell us where to put our embassy in Canada?\" he asked sarcastically. \"I'm not talking about relations with Canada or Israel. I'm talking about Germany saying, 'Well, you can't put your embassy in Canada there.'\" \n\n\"Obviously the Middle East is a sensitive area,\" he conceded. \"You want to be prudent, you want to be careful. But you ought to do what the United States needs to have done. The qualms that others may have are things you need to alleviate, you need to deal with, you need to be reasonable about it, but they're not qualms that stop you from acting in your own interest.\"\n\nBolton said it was \"absolutely\" a good thing that Israel has been \"emboldened\" to build more settlements by Trump's election.\n\n\"There's a huge legal battle over what the status of the so-called occupied territories is, going back to the League of Nations mandate, and the assumption of the mandate by the United Nations in 1945, and the termination of the mandate in Israel's declaration of independence in 1948,\" he recalled. \n\n\"I mean, we could spend hours going through this. Here's the reality: the U.N. in 1967 basically said, after the Six-Day War, Israel can trade land for peace. Up until the resolution Obama allowed to go through, two days before Christmas, that was the basis for peace in the Middle East. That was the basis for Israel's peace treaty with Egypt, for its treaty with Jordan. It could have been the basis of peace with others.\" \n\n\"Israel has the land. Let's forget the legalities. Israel has control of the territory. They believe it's their land, dating back historically, and they're building settlements on it. I tell you what, nobody's going to stop them,\" Bolton declared. \n\n\"You can either deal with that reality and look for what a solution for the Palestinians would be \u2013 I don't think it's the two-state solution, I think it's giving parts of the West Bank to Jordan, putting it under their sovereignty, Israel keeping the rest. Or you can just enjoy the rhetoric about how settlements are an obstacle to peace, and it's really terrible, and so on and so forth. It's the same sort of threatening rhetoric that accompanies talk about whether the U.S. will move its embassy to Jerusalem,\" he said.\n\n\"So I think the real answer, I think the Israelis know what they're doing. I think they're going to create their own facts on the ground, which is what the United States ought to do with the embassy,\" he suggested.\n\nMarlow turned to President Trump's executive orders restricting immigration from several Muslim-majority countries, orders which are certain to stir up controversy. Bolton noted those countries were also places where \"we can have little or no faith in the sustained ability of the so-called governments of these countries to be able to tell us honestly the backgrounds of a lot of people who are applying for visas.\"\n\n\"There is no effective government in Yemen now, for example, just to name one. Or Syria, while we're on the subject,\" Bolton said. \"It's a temporary ban. I think Trump during the campaign, although he made sweeping statements earlier, came back by the end of the campaign to a program very similar to what Ted Cruz articulated, very similar to what the George W. Bush administration put in place after 9/11: that you're concerned more about applicants for visas from countries that are sources of terrorism than you're concerned about applicants for visas from countries that are not sources of terrorism.\" \n\n\"I would be more concerned across the board about somebody from Syria applying for a visa than I am about somebody from Iceland applying for a visa,\" he said. \"This is not hard to figure out. It doesn't have anything to do with religion. It has to do with terrorism.\"\n\n\"So getting the system under control \u2013 and I think law enforcement and intelligence officials, even in the Obama administration, testified that we didn't have adequate vetting for visa applicants \u2013 is sensible. It's what Trump said he was going to do. Nobody should be surprised at this,\" Bolton concluded.\n\nCommenting on the recent court setback for Brexit,\u00a0Bolton said he didn't think the ruling was \"quite as bad as it could have been,\" and doubted it would be a serious impediment to British Prime Minister Theresa May \"negotiating Brexit on her terms.\"\n\n\"Some of the things they didn't do in the court ruling are important,\" he noted. \"Number One, there's no reference in this issue to the European High Court, the highest judicial body of the European Union, which could have been fatal. Given the way nation-states have been subordinated to the European Union, that was not entirely out of the question. So that's one big win there.\"\n\n\"Second, none of the so-called devolved parliaments \u2013 whether in Ireland, Wales, or Scotland \u2013 are going to have any say in it,\" he continued. \"The court ruled this is a national matter for the United Kingdom as a whole, and that's great. So Nicola Sturgeon and the Scottish National Party can go pound sand on this one. It's going to be decided in Westminster by the House of Commons and the House of Lords.\"\n\n\"In fact, they said it's not a question of the Prime Minister's authority to take Britain out of the European Union treaty, it's an issue dealing with statutory law in Great Britain, because so much European law over these past 30 years has been imposed on Great Britain that it would take an act of Parliament to begin the exit process,\" Bolton observed. \"I don't think that's really going to be an obstacle. I think they in fact are talking about introducing a bill this week. It can be a very short bill.\"\n\n\"The Labor party and the Liberal Democrats can moan and groan about it all they want, but Theresa May has a solid majority, and I think they'll push it through,\" he predicted. \"In fact, I think Labor, the Liberal Democrats in particular, will just do themselves more damage by saying, 'You know, by God, just because the people voted to leave the European Union doesn't mean they're as smart as we are! We're going to substitute our judgment for theirs and try and prevent it from happening.' You know, knock yourself out if that's what you want to do. I just think it's politically foolish on their part.\"\n\n\"But I would have preferred a cleaner victory,\" he added. \"I think this decision to withdraw is prospective only. I don't see why you need a parliamentary vote. But given the majority the conservatives have, I don't even think they can slow it down that much.\"\n\nJohn Bolton is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and presides over his own political action committee, BoltonPAC.\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\u00a0to 9:00 a.m.\u00a0Eastern.\n\nListen to the audio of the full interview above.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.10272777080536, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1541, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 11, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.9417242524900002, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 45, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170126050000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.92018170019468, "mft_mean": 4.090909090909999}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/12/03/tancredo-an-american-culture-is-not-a-racist-concept/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [153, 1578, 3224]}}, "headline": "Tancredo: An \u2018American Culture\u2019 Isn\u2019t a Racist Concept", "wordcount_as_scraped": 581, "date": "20161204100000", "story_content": "A few years ago a reporter called to ask for my response to an incident he had observed while doing\u00a0 a story about the closing of the Roy Rogers Museum in Victorville, California.\n\nWhile getting local opinions about the closure of this once-popular attraction, he approached a Hispanic woman sitting in the bar of a neighborhood lounge. He asked her what she thought about this \"end of an era\" event. She said, \"There's a revolution going on here and it don't include no Roy Rogers or Bob Hope.\"\n\nI told the reporter that she was being very candid and accurate in her assessment of the what was happening. Not only in Victorville, but in the country as whole.\n\nIndeed there is a revolution going on in America. It is a revolution of subnational identities against what was the predominant Anglo-Protestant culture.\n\nThis movement started in the 1960s and was exacerbated by the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1965. The legislation eliminated national quotas in favor of what is called \"family unification.\" What it led to was a wave of immigration that has resulted in over 40 million newcomers; a number far greater than the total of all previous years of our history. It also helped speed the process of the deconstructing of America.\n\nThe legislation had a powerful supporter in the person of Senator Ted Kennedy, who saw it as a way to change the face of America that he and other liberals deemed to be too white. Long before Obama, the cult of multiculturalism was affecting national policy. The cult\u00a0 substituted diversity for unity as the overriding national value. They started a war on English as the common language, and the founding fathers as idealistic and courageous patriots.\n\nOf course, they also saw the political advantage of tribalizing America. Victimized sub groups could be exploited for votes and party loyalty. This political calculus requires a constant supply of \u201cvictims\u201d in order to maintain political power. Massive immigration of unskilled, low wage workers who were resistant to and encouraged to avoid assimilation, provides the replenishment of the underclass and must be maintained to avoid slipping back into an E pluribus unum America.\n\nAnd I should add that I don't believe that pluribus has to be defined to mean that the \"many\" have to be white. Indeed, in the past we were able to maintain a common idea of America, an American Creed if you will, because the assimilation process was an integral part of the immigration phenomena and it wasn\u2019t dependent on the color of the immigrant's skin.\n\nWhether or not it depends on an immigrant's religion is another question. Can Muslims who adhere to Sharia law be expected to excise that part of their faith where it is incompatible with the Constitution of the United States? Should they be required to do so as a condition of admittance? Your answer to that and the whole issue of massive immigration without assimilation depends on whether you believe the American culture can, or should be saved.\n\nI\u2019ve always found it typically hypocritical of the left to champion the importance of retaining all aspects of one's culture, including its language, for all cultures\u00a0 except America's.\n\nWhether or not the revolution that the customer in that Victorville bar referred to has succeeded or whether Donald Trump's election is the beginning of the counter revolution are questions, the answers to which will certainly determine what the term \"American\" will define.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 1.14942526817322, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 569, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.3673198504500004, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 7, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161204100000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.92091388400703, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/milo/2017/01/20/dear-milo-thank-you/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1941, 2124, 2517, 3543, 3775, 4222, 4264, 4446, 5671, 5685, 5979, 6153, 6162, 6188, 6247, 6250, 6295]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 945, "scraper_regex": 1066}}, "headline": "Dear Milo: Thank You", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1066, "date": "20170120200000", "story_content": "Dear MILO \u2014 I\u2019m not one to write fan letters, but I realized I wouldn\u2019t get my (completely unnecessary) beauty sleep unless I took some time to say: thank you.\n\nI know you are deluged with fan mail from the college students, military personnel and even grandmothers whose lives you\u2019ve touched, but I hope you take a few minutes to read this letter.

The fake news media has gone into overdrive printing lies about you. The campus crybabies have moved past protesting you; they now are threatening to stab you. And the bitcoin brownshirt wing of the alt-right continues to hate your guts.\n\nWithout question, your voice is the one that reached millennials on campus, in military service, and, yes, even those currently living in their mom\u2019s basement thanks to the Obama economy.\n\nWhile other leading lights of conservatism were busy arguing policy points or foolishly\u00a0throwing their weight behind the #NeverTrump movement, you reached young people with a message of free speech, free expression and spread Donald Trump\u2019s message of unleashing hell on\u00a0the liberal status quo.\n\nYou completely called it when you wrote in June of 2015 that Donald Trump should be the Internet\u2019s candidate for President. He was. He was also America\u2019s choice. You were one of the vanishingly few people in public life never to doubt his victory \u2014 or the power of the internet to propel him to the most powerful elected office on the face of the Earth. Meme magic is\u00a0real.\n\nYou\u2019ve waged a vast war for free speech on campuses practically single-handed\u2026 and won! You\u2019re like a skinny Rambo, with better hair and diction. Your Dangerous Faggot Tour showed young conservatives that they don\u2019t have to furtively hide in the shadows on campus \u2014 leading to them expressing themselves as vociferously as their liberal classmates.\n\nCan anyone imagine conservative students chalking messages about their candidate in any other situation? Congratulations for inspiring and entertaining an entire generation of young mischief-makers and freedom-lovers.\n\nYour tour had other effects on voters besides emboldening young conservatives. Your speeches frequently exposed Americans to the ugly underbelly of identity politics. Without a doubt, tens of thousands of voters who would have otherwise voted for Crooked Hillary chose to vote third party or stay home after seeing videos of the hysterical crybabies who have replaced classical liberals in the Democrat power structure. They have been left pondering\u00a0how their party became the party of hatred and violence.\n\nNot to mention many thousands of undecided voters who chose Trump based on the protestors and university administrations who bent over backwards apologizing for allowing you\u00a0to speak on their campus.\n\nCan you blame undecided voters for rejecting four years of the country being run by the most boring nannies and scolds in history? Joyless, soulless schoolmarms may run many American universities, but they won\u2019t run America, in part thanks to you, Milo.\n\nI know you could read this forever, because I could write it forever. But both of us need to get back to work, because electing Donald Trump was just the first step\u00a0in the coming culture war \u2014 a war we will\u00a0win. Maybe my second book will be one long fan letter to myself. In the meantime, I will wrap this up with a few more important MILO moments.\n\nYour war with Sharia-compliant Twitter\u00a0in 2016 exposed just how far Silicon Valley had descended into liberal activism.

They\u00a0reported that it would cover those who are unable to manage their own affairs for a multitude of reasons \u2014 from \"subnormal intelligence or mental illness\" to \"incompetency,\" an unspecified \"condition,\" or \"disease\u201d \u2014 and would put the Second Amendment rights of such recipients in jeopardy.\n\nOn January 5, 2016, Obama\u00a0incorporated the ban into his executive gun controls. A\u00a0White House preview\u00a0of those controls explained that the Social Security Administration (SSA) was busy finalizing rules for how and when to enforce the ban:\n\nCurrent law prohibits individuals from buying a gun if, because of a mental health issue, they are either a danger to themselves or others or are unable to manage their own affairs. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has indicated that it will begin the rulemaking process to ensure that appropriate information in its records is reported to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). The reporting that SSA, in consultation with the Department of Justice, is expected to require will cover appropriate records of the approximately 75,000 people each year who have a documented mental health issue, receive disability benefits, and are unable to manage those benefits because of their mental impairment, or who have been found by a state or federal court to be legally incompetent. The rulemaking will also provide a mechanism for people to seek relief from the federal prohibition on possessing a firearm for reasons related to mental health.\n\nIn early May 2016, the SSA released a 41-page preview of the ban.\u00a0Page 19\u00a0made clear that beneficiaries who catch\u00a0the SSA's attention \u2014 by having someone help with finances \u2014 could find themselves the subject of an SSA attempt to determine mental health status. The SSA preview shows that the investigation to determine mental health status would become incrementally intrusive and, if a ruling of mental illness sufficient to meet the reporting threshold is issued, the beneficiary would be reported to NICS and prohibited from purchasing firearms.\n\nIn the week before Christmas 2016, the Obama administration issued the finalized version of the ban, paffecting the Second Amendment rights of at least tens of thousands of Social Security recipients. The Times\u00a0reported that upwards of \u201c4.2 million\u201d recipients receive help with their finances, which means the number of recipients impacted could actually be in the millions.\n\nNow Congress is acting to stop the ban. USA Today reports that Congress will take up legislation that will \u201cprevent the government from declaring some Social Security recipients unfit to own guns after they've been deemed mentally incapable of managing their financial affairs.\u201d\n\nThe NRA-ILA\u2019s Chris Cox responded to Congress\u2019 plans to end the ban, saying, \u201cCongress\u2019 decision to review the Obama administration\u2019s backdoor gun grab is a significant step forward in restoring the fundamental constitutional rights of many law-abiding gun owners. The NRA has been fighting this unconstitutional government overreach since it was first discussed and we look forward to swift congressional action to overturn it.\u201d\n\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

Roosevelt as \"a date which will live in infamy.\"\n\n\"As the Prime Minister of Japan, I offer my sincere and everlasting condolences to the souls of those who lost their lives here, as well as to the spirits of all the brave men and women whose lives were taken by a war that commenced in this very place. We must never repeat the horrors of war again,\" said Abe, in the passage of his remarks that will surely be the most widely quoted and discussed.\n\nSpeaking after his visit to the USS Arizona memorial, Abe said it was \"a place which brought utter stillness to me.\"\n\nHe did not understate the enormity of the attack on Pearl Harbor, or the horror of the lives that were lost, during his often poetic speech.\n\n\"Inscribed there are the names of the servicemen who lost their lives,\" the Prime Minister said. \"Sailors and marines hailing from California and New York, Michigan and Texas, and various other places, serving to uphold their noble duty of protecting the homeland they loved, lost their lives amidst searing flames that day, when aerial bombing tore the USS Arizona in two.\"\n\nAfter envisioning the scene aboard the ships at Pearl Harbor on the morning of December 7, 1941, Abe said, \"Each and every one of those servicemen had a mother and a father anxious about his safety. Many had wives and girlfriends they loved. And many must have had children they would have loved to watch grow up. All of that was brought to an end. When I contemplate that solemn reality, I am rendered entirely speechless.\"\n\nHe said the Japanese people have taken a \"solemn vow\" to never wage war again, a vow he repeated to \"the souls of the servicemen who lie in eternal rest aboard the USS Arizona.\"\n\nAbe praised Japan's creation of a \"free and democratic country that values the rule of law,\"and said his people harbor \"quiet pride in the path we have walked as a peace-loving nation over these 70 years since the war ended.\"\n\nAbe spoke of visiting the memorial marker for an Imperial Japanese fighter pilot named Commander Fusata Iida who died after refusing to return to his carrier during the Pearl Harbor attack, and noted it was U.S. servicemen who built the marker in tribute to Iida's bravery. \n\n(The U.S. Marine Corps regards Iida, the highest-ranking officer in the attack force, as World War II's first kamikaze pilot; he was shot down before he could hit either of the targets he was likely aiming at.)\n\nAbe said the respect shown to Iida, and the compassion shown to the Japanese people after the war, were examples\u00a0of \"the spirit of tolerance embraced by the American people.\"\n\n\"The goodwill and assistance you extended to us Japanese, the enemy you had fought so fiercely, together with the tremendous spirit of tolerance were etched deeply into the hearts and minds of our grandfathers and mothers. We also remember them. Our children and grandchildren will also continue to pass these memories down and never forget what you did for us,\" he said.\n\nAbe said the world urgently needs the \"spirit of tolerance and the power of reconciliation\" exemplified by America's relationship with Japan.\n\n\"Japan and the United States, which have eradicated hatred and cultivated friendship and trust on the basis of common values, are now, and especially now, taking responsibility for appealing to the world about the importance of tolerance and the power of reconciliation. That is precisely why the Japan-U.S. alliance is \u2018an alliance of hope,'\" he said.\n\nAbe and Obama \"placed a pair of green-and-peach wreaths made of lilies aboard the USS Arizona Memorial and tossed purple flower petals into the water,\" as the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe AP cites Japan's government describing Abe's visit as \"powerful proof that the former enemies have transcended the recriminatory impulses that weighed down relations after the war.\" It is also portrayed as \"an act of symbolic reciprocity, coming six months after Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to visit Hiroshima in Japan, where the U.S. dropped an atomic bomb in hopes of ending the war it entered after Pearl Harbor.\"\n\nAs the Associated Press report observes, Japanese feelings on the war remain conflicted. Abe's visit to Pearl Harbor is seen as politically sensitive today, and would have been impossible just a few years ago. Remarkably, the Japanese government claimed last month that Pearl Harbor wasn't supposed to be a surprise attack, and America's formal invitation to join the war merely got lost in a bureaucratic shuffle. \n\nPrime Minister Abe had domestic political considerations, and delicate relations with other nations along the Pacific Rim, to consider when he chose his words. The Chinese Foreign Ministry was sneering that Japan \"can never turn this page over without reconciliation from China and other victimized countries in Asia,\" even as Abe was landing in Hawaii.\n\nEven so, it might have been better for Japan's national psyche if Prime Minister Abe had taken responsibility and offered a forthright apology at Pearl Harbor, instead of talking about a worldwide tragedy that \"commenced\" there. It didn't commence on its own. Somebody commenced it, and it wasn't the American servicemen Abe described so beautifully.\n\nPrime Minister Abe's speech begins about 25 minutes into the White House video embedded below:\n\n", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 16, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.6597510576248202, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 897, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 16, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 5, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 5.75390632671, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 16, "mft_sum": 47, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161228140000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.2396878483835, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 4.27272727273}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/01/24/nigeria-warns-women-suicide-bombers-infants/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1811, 1874, 2186, 2614, 2778, 3051, 4046, 4178]}}, "headline": "Nigeria Warns of Women Suicide Bombers Carrying Infants", "wordcount_as_scraped": 734, "date": "20170125080000", "story_content": "Two women suicide bombers, believed to be tied to the Islamic State affiliate Boko Haram, reportedly committed a bombing in Nigeria while carrying infants on their backs.\n\nFour people were killed by the terrorist attack in the northeastern town of Madagali, Adamawa State, last week, not including the two women and the two infants. They were two of four suicide bombers, police reported \u2014 two others detonated their bombs at a security checkpoint after being stopped. The women with the infants were not checked for bombs and detonated them around civilians in a market.\n\nThe use of child suicide bombers, particularly girls, has become a hallmark of Boko Haram. The jihadist group conducts mass abductions of women and girls, often selling them into sex slavery or \u201cmarrying\u201d them off to jihadists and forcing them to convert to Islam.\n\nThe group rose to international prominence in 2014 after abducting hundreds of young girls from a secondary school in Chibok, Borno state, most of whom remain missing. The Nigerian military announced they had found an escaped Chibok girl and her child, born in captivity, earlier this month. The military has also successfully negotiated the release of a minority of the girls in the past two years.\n\nThe girls used in suicide bombings, most of which are not part of the Chibok group, have bombs strapped onto them and are sent into crowded markets, churches, or mosques. UNICEF announced in April 2016 that the use of underaged girls as suicide bombers had increased ten-fold in one year.\n\nBefore the bombing involving the infants, the most recent child suicide bomb attack in Nigeria had occurred a week ago in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State. Boko Haram has established itself in Borno, where it was founded.\u00a0Police identified the suicide bombers in last week\u2019s attack as\u00a0a 7-year-old and a 12-year-old.\n\nThe use of infants in suicide attacks, however, appears to be a new tactic. UNICEF told Reuters that the incident was the first of its kind they had recorded, though the Reuters report says only one infant died in the attack and two underaged girls; the BBC reported two infants\u00a0killed. Reuters also reported that 17 people were killed in total. \u201cWe are extremely worried about the use of a baby in this callous way,\u201d UNICEF spokeswoman Doune Porter told Reuters. It presents a new threat to the youngest among the victims of Boko Haram, few of whom have survived the insurgency in the past five years, according to aid groups.\n\nDoctors Without Borders, which operates throughout northern Nigeria, told the\u00a0New York Times this week that they have seen an alarming drop in the number of young children in refugee and internally displaced (IDP) communities. The group, the\u00a0Times notes, \u201creported in November that it was seeing hardly any children under age 5 at its clinics, hospitals and feeding centers.\u201d\n\n\"We saw only older brothers and sisters. No toddlers straddling their big sisters' hips, no babies strapped to their mothers' backs,\u201d the\u00a0Times quotes the organization\u2019s statement as reading. In addition to jihadist persecution, many children face a variety of diseases due to living in areas that are now inaccessible to humanitarian groups due to Boko Haram. Many of the medical challenges facing them, like a resurgence of polio, are completely avoidable using modern medical technology.\n\nEven those who have successfully fled Boko Haram face countless hardships. In the Rann IDP camp that houses many whose villages have been destroyed in Boko Haram raids, human rights groups say women and girls are forced or deceived into sexual relationships in order to feed themselves and their children. Adding to their indignity, the Nigerian military conducted an airstrike on the refugee camp last week, a move military officials described as a mistake.\n\n\"We saw dozens of patients with multiple traumatic injuries, including open fractures and wounds to the abdomen and chest,\u201d one physician with Doctors Without Borders told Canada\u2019s\u00a0Globe and Mail of the airstrike. \"I saw the bodies of children that had been cut in two,\u201d lamented another.\n\nThe Nigerian newspaper\u00a0Vanguard reports that local government officials claim over 250 people were killed in the airstrike, though official estimates put the number closer to one hundred.\n\nBoko Haram has killed an estimated 15,000 people, according to Reuters. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari declared that he had \u201cwon the war\u201d against the jihadist group in December 2015.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -7.56192970275879, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 702, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 11, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 2, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 3.24228263639, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170125080000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.41880341880342, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2016/11/16/nyc-mulls-deleting-illegal-alien-database-stop-trump/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [1006, 1514, 1528, 2303]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 534, "scraper_regex": 403}}, "headline": "NYC Mulls Deleting Illegal Alien Database to Stop Trump", "wordcount_as_scraped": 403, "date": "20161116150000", "story_content": "New York City may delete their city ID cards to protect illegal aliens from deportation risks as a result of the November election.\n\nNYC initiated the largest municipal ID card program in 2015 and now the City is worried about President-Elect Donald Trump and his immigration policies, reported the Associated Press on Wednesday.\n\nBreitbart News reported in September of 2014 that New York was offering free attractions to get illegal aliens to apply for city IDs.

Having called for \u201cphasing out\u201d oil sands from the nation\u2019s economy, Calgarians greeted Trudeau with loud\u00a0boos and, in some instances, barely managed to let Trudeau answer their barbed questions.\n\nForum found that 48 percent of Canadians approve of the job Trudeau is doing as Prime Minister, the first time his approval has crossed the 50 percent mark. \u201cThose are the worst numbers Forum \u2014 or any other pollster \u2014 has registered for Trudeau since he became prime minister,\u201d the firm notes.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s approval rating dropped ten percentage points since\u00a0November, during which he became the target of international scorn for praising late Communist dictator Fidel Castro. Trudeau dropped another three points in December, Forum adds, following the revelation that he had attended lavish Trudeau Foundation meetings where Chinese millionaire lobbyists were present.\n\nForum notes that Trudeau remains the most popular political party leader in the country. The approval gap between his\u00a0Liberal Party and the rival Conservatives is closing, however.\n\nCanada\u2019s CBC suggests the approval ratings are not out of the ordinary, citing the approval ratings of his predecessors while having served the same amount of time in office. CBC adds, however, that \u201cthe current prime minister\u2019s disapproval rating is five points lower than either of his two predecessors at this stage of their mandate.\u201d Trudeau is significantly more popular at this juncture in his tenure than his father, the leftist radical Pierre Trudeau, was, however, whose approval rating stood at 34 percent\u00a0at the same point in his term.\n\nPlacing an exclamation point at the end of the news of his popularity collapse, Trudeau attended a town hall in Calgary Tuesday in which he was greet with, at best, extreme skepticism. In a vivid recounting of the event, CBC reports\u00a0that \u201ca\u00a0few\u00a0voices in the crowd frequently peppered the prime minister with heckles\u201d and \u201can elderly man seated in the last row of the crowd persistently badgered the prime minister throughout the event, asking him if he had ever gone without a meal, and made other inaudible comments about Fidel Castro and\u00a0Chinese Communists.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, the report notes that \u201ca group of girls\u201d came to the Prime Minister\u2019s defense, shouting \u201cwe love you, Justin!\u201d at the head of government.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrudeau responded to hecklers by\u00a0treating the town hall like a classroom. \u201cAs a teacher, I try not to reward bad behaviour by giving them too much attention,\u201d he said, recalling his years in classes. Protesters outside the event, CBC notes, had also not forgotten the Prime Minister\u2019s former career, brandishing signs reading \u201cGo Back to Teaching Drama.\u201d\n\nTrudeau\u2019s toughest moment during the town hall, however, was not the booing, but answering a pointed question from a man demanding to know what Trudeau meant when he said he was considering \u201cphasing out\u201d oil sands from the nation\u2019s economy, a key job source in Alberta. Trudeau had later walked back his comments.\n\n\"You've been saying two different messages,\" a town hall attendee said. \"Down east, you've been telling people that you want to kill the single-biggest employer in our province\u2026\u00a0You're in Alberta right now sir, you're not in Ottawa. Yet, when you come to Calgary, you tell people you're sorry\u2026 You're either a liar or you're confused.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cI have been extremely consistent,\u201d Trudeau replied to the town hall questioner.\n\nThe anger against Trudeau over his on-again, off-again calls to end the fossil fuel industry in Alberta have somewhat shifted the focus of his opponents back onto policy away from the various corruption scandals surrounding his tenure. Since 2017 began, Trudeau has been facing criticism for a New Year\u2019s Eve trip to the Bahamas, where he and his family stayed on the private residence of the Aga Khan, the head of the Ismaili Muslim sect, a branch of Shia Islam.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s office initially refused to tell reporters where the Prime Minister had spent the new year, triggering criticism of a nominally \u201ctransparent\u201d administration. When\u00a0the office finally revealed his destination, it became clear that Trudeau had crossed an ethics line, accepting a private helicopter ride to the Aga Khan\u2019s personal island in the Bahamas. Both Liberal Party and Canadian government ethics rule prohibit the Prime Minister from doing this without requesting prior authorization from the ethics office. Trudeau is currently facing an unprecedented ethics probe over the incident, and has revealed this not to be the first such vacation he has taken with the religious leader.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.99530518054962, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 774, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 1, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 5, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.3496087242400003, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 16, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170126000000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.0671834625323, "mft_mean": 1.45454545455}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/12/15/9-reasons-politifact-unqualified-label-fake-news/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [146, 184, 612, 759, 823, 904, 919, 1035, 1112, 1245, 1260, 1273, 1331, 1402, 1486, 1509, 1600, 1614, 1632, 1684, 2275, 2550, 2604, 2651, 3152, 3460, 3530, 3601, 3749, 3842, 4002, 4016, 4027]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 601, "scraper_regex": 641}}, "headline": "9 Reasons Why PolitiFact Is Unqualified to Label \u2018Fake News\u2019", "wordcount_as_scraped": 641, "date": "20161216060000", "story_content": "Left-leaning PolitiFact is on the newly revealed list of \u201cfact checking\u201d organizations\u00a0Facebook will reportedly use to label\u00a0\u201cfake news\u201d stories as they appear on the social media platform.\n\n\u201cWe'll use the reports from our community, along with other signals, to send stories to these organizations,\" Facebook VP Adam Mosseri wrote in the Facebook news blog. \"If the fact checking organizations identify a story as fake, it will get flagged as disputed and there will be a link to the corresponding article explaining why.\"\n\nFacebook\u2019s decision to tout\u00a0PolitiFact as a credible and independent fact checker is awfully disturbing, given the organization\u2019s repeated smear campaign against Donald Trump\u00a0throughout the 2016 election.\n\nFacebook\u2019s \u201cfake news\u201d flaggers,\u00a0Politifact, et al., have a history of showing sympathy for left-wing narratives.\u00a0Time and again\u00a0PolitiFact published stories that favored Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy, while promoting \u201cfact checks\u201d meant to rebut\u00a0or embarrass Republicans.\n\nBelow is a list of the many instances proving why\u00a0Politifact is completely unqualified to be an objective judge of what\u2019s real and \u201cfake\u201d news.\n\n1. Last March, PolitiFact delivered a\u00a0\u201cmostly false\u201d\u00a0rating for a\u00a0joke made by Republican Senator Ted Cruz.\n\n2. Last April,\u00a0PolitiFact made phone calls and sent a reporter to investigate whether\u00a0Governor Scott Walker actually \u201cpaid one dollar for\u201d a sweater he bought at Kohl's.\u00a0PolitiFact later ruled\u00a0Walker\u2019s claim \u201ctrue.\u201d\n\n3. When Trump said Clinton wants \u201copen borders,\u201d PolitiFact deemed\u00a0his statement\u00a0\u201cmostly false\u201d \u2014 \u00a0despite the fact that Clinton admitted as much in a\u00a0private, paid speech to a Brazilian bank on May 16, 2013. \u201cMy dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders,\u201d she said at the time.\n\n4. PolitiFact cast doubts on comments Pat Smith made during her emotional speech at the Republican National Convention, where she said Hillary Clinton said \u201ca video was responsible\u201d for her son\u2019s death during the terror attacks in Benghazi.\n\nSmith was referring to when she \u201csaw Hillary Clinton at Sean's coffin ceremony,\u201d and then-Secretary of State Clinton \u201clooked me squarely in the eye and told me a video was responsible.\u201d\n\nBut\u00a0PolitiFact, taking an oddly defensive stance, said Smith\u2019s memory could\u2019ve been \u201cfuzzy\u201d and referred its readers, instead, to a \u201cbrief meeting behind closed doors\u201d where Clinton addressed the families of the victims of the attack.\n\n5. Despite video evidence to the contrary,\u00a0PolitiFact claimed Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t laugh about\u00a0Kathy Shelton's rape as a child. Trump invited\u00a0Shelton to the second presidential debate and called out Clinton\u2019s embarrassing behavior.\n\nAgain, moving to dismiss and downplay Clinton\u2019s actions, PolitiFact wrote: \u201cTrump is referring to an audio tape in which she does respond with amusement at her recollections of the oddities of the case, which involve the prosecution and the judge. At no point does she laugh at the victim.\u201d\n\n6. In an attempt to explain Hillary Clinton\u2019s role in the sale of 25 percent of the United States\u2019 uranium stockpile,\u00a0Politifact ignored numerous key facts, downplayed other key facts, and ultimately made 13 errors in its analysis.\n\n7. A few months later, PolitiFact was, again, attempting to whitewash Clinton\u2019s role in the Russian uranium deal. Like PolitiFact\u2019s first foray into the subject, the second report commits many\u00a0factual errors and is full of glaring inaccuracies and omissions.\n\n8.\u00a0During a televised campaign event, Clinton said Australia\u2019s compulsory\u00a0gun buyback program \u201cwould be worth considering\" in the U.S.\n\nWhen the National Rifle Association included Clinton\u2019s comments on one of its flyers,\u00a0PolitiFact ruled the organization\u2019s claim \u201cmostly false.\u201d\n\n9. While Politifact admitted that\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that Russia\u2019s arsenal of nuclear warheads has expanded and the U.S.\u2019s has not, the left-wing outfit deemed Trump\u2019s statement \u201chalf true.\u201d\n\nFollow\u00a0Jerome Hudson\u00a0on Twitter\u00a0@jeromeehudson", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 5, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -4.861111164093019, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 601, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 0, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.5048132143000001, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 5, "mft_sum": 10, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161216060000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 1.6638935108153101, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 0.909090909091}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2017/01/03/imam-advising-government-on-sharia-lauds-radical-islam-apologists-hope-not-hate/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [301, 1537]}}, "headline": "Imam Advising Govt on Sharia Lauds Radical Islam Apologists Hope Not Hate", "wordcount_as_scraped": 675, "date": "20170104020000", "story_content": "An imam involved with the British government's review of Sharia courts in Britain has praised the divisive left-wing organisation Hope not Hate for what he termed their \"incredible work\" opposing \"hatred\".\n\nIn an article for The\u00a0Yorkshire Post, Qari Asim MBE, chief imam at Makkah Masjid mosque in Leeds, praised the group while denouncing the \"populism\" which led to both the Brexit vote and Donald Trump's election as the next president of the U.S.\n\n\"2016 will be remembered as a year when the values that underpin our society \u2013 freedom, tolerance, and respect for fundamental rights \u2013 were crushed by the rise of populism in the West,\" Asim wrote.\n\nHe continued: \"The anti-migrant, anti-ethnic and anti-Muslim rhetoric and politics of hatred used during the EU referendum and US presidential campaign gave legitimacy and a new-found voice to racist and bigoted narratives across the world.\"\n\nAsim then claimed Muslims, in particular, have borne the brunt of discrimination, writing: \"Muslims and mosques continued to be attacked during 2016 across the UK and Europe. Islamophobia gained particular validation and legitimacy this past year.\n\n\"Muslims have become the prime target of the prejudice and hatred whipped up by far right populist leaders and lazy journalists.\"\n\nHe went on to single out both Hope not Hate and another EU backed group \u2018British Future\u2019 \u2013 which in December 2015 called Donald Trump a \u201chate preacher\u201d and demanded he be banned from the UK\u00a0\u2013 as examples of organisations working against the perceived bigotry of the populist movement:\n\n\"I am inspired to see countless examples of extraordinary dedication and courage for the vulnerable, of selfless service to others by faith institutions and charities and protection of others' freedoms. The incredible work of Hope Not Hate and the think-thank British Future around hatred, immigration and integration in post-referendum Britain is extremely valuable.\"\n\nHowever, Hope not Hate has been slammed by moderate Muslims, who accuse the left-wing organisation of being a mouthpiece for radical Islam. In December, Muslim reformist and former U.S. naval officer Dr. Zuhdi Jasser told Breitbart that the group employed \"Orwellian\" tactics to silence moderate Muslims.\n\n\"We [moderate Muslims] get slammed from the radicals who say we're not Muslims and we're apostates even though we love our faith.\n\n\"And, we get slammed from the left, who is doing the bidding of the Saudis and the Iranian government and others who really don't want us reformists to have a voice. So, they're smothering our voices. But the bottom line answer is: They're the bigots,\" Jasser said.\n\nIn December 2015, Hope Not Hate labelled Jasser an \"anti-Muslim extremist\" alongside the hijab-wearing, practising Muslim Raquel Saraswati, who campaigns against regressive forms of Sharia law, in a report on what it termed the \"counter jihad movement\".\n\n\"Their Orwellian approach is actually doing takfir\", Jasser added, referring to the Islamic practice of declaring a Muslim to be an apostate.\n\nBy lauding Hope Not Hate, Asim aligns himself with the organisation\u2019s controversial views on Islam, calling into question his suitability to advise the government on Sharia law.\n\nAsim is one of two \"leading imams\" who have been asked by the Conservative government to advise a panel tasked with investigating whether Sharia is being used to persecute women in Britain. As such, he will be offering theological and religious opinion on matters pertaining to the practice of Sharia.\n\nBut the inquiry has already been slammed by critics, who say it is asking the wrong questions. Baroness Cox, a cross-bench peer who has worked extensively to give a voice to women in Britain who have been victimised by Sharia courts in the UK, called out Prime Minister Theresa May in particular on her insistence that discrimination against women is due to \"misuse\" of Sharia teaching rather than the teaching itself.\n\nOf the report, Cox said: \"My reservation is that it won't get to the root of the problem. A lot of Muslim women I know say that the men in their communities just laugh at this proposed investigation, that they will go underground so the investigation will have to be very robust.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.37078642845154, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 658, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.14360474955, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 26, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170104020000, "FairnessVice": 4, "pct_mft_words": 3.95136778115502, "mft_mean": 2.3636363636400004}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/01/06/fort-lauderdale-shooter-esteban-santiago-troubled-man-already-known-fbi/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [270, 508, 2785, 2794, 4176]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 700, "scraper_regex": 816}}, "headline": "Fort Lauderdale Shooter Esteban Santiago, A Troubled Man Known to the FBI", "wordcount_as_scraped": 816, "date": "20170107060000", "story_content": "Fort Lauderdale airport shooter Esteban Santiago was a troubled man with a history of mental health issues, along with claims of connections to the ISIS terror group, plus possible involvement with\u00a0the FBI, say media reports of his background.\n\nAs news about the 26-year-old man rolls out, evidence shows Esteban Santiago to be a veteran of both the Alaska National Guard and the Puerto Rico National Guard. But the reports also show a\u00a0young man who apparently claimed to have heard voices in his head telling him to join terror group ISIS, who had been under psychiatric treatment, and who turned himself in to the FBI claiming the terror group was compelling him to act.\n\nSantiago flew on a Friday Air Canada fight from Anchorage, Alaska, stopped over in Minneapolis, Minnesota, then deplaned in Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International airport. Then he walked to the baggage claim area, retrieved a gun he was legally transporting in his luggage, loaded it in a bathroom and emerged firing randomly at anyone who was near him.\n\nOnce he ran out of ammunition, he reportedly sat down on the floor and awaited authorities to take him away.\n\nWhen the smoke cleared 13 people were wounded and five killed. Santiago was then taken into custody without further incident and carted away. Hundreds of people were terrorized and the airport was completely shut down as a result of his rampage.\n\nThe site of the unexpected attack was a \u201cgun-free zone\u201d in a state that bans concealed carry for everyone in airports so there was no possibility of anyone being able to stop the shooter with any measure of quick response.\n\nNow we know some details of Santiago\u2019s life, although not exactly why he would commit this terrible act.\n\nPictured: The Fort Lauderdale 'air rage' gunman https://t.co/btZ61jquzn pic.twitter.com/lMzBWLk0tK\n\u2014 Daily Mail US (@DailyMail) January 6, 2017\n\n\n\nSantiago is a former U.S. Army Reservist who served in Alaska and was born in New Jersey, according to NBC News.\n\nFox Affiliate WSVN in Miami reported that the gunman\u2019s brother, identified as Bryan, said that Esteban had been under a psychiatrist\u2019s care when he lived in Alaska.

ABC insisted its source told them that Santiago had told the FBI that the U.S. government had forced him to watch ISIS videos and made him associate with ISIS.\n\nThe shooter is said to have turned himself in to the FBI in November or 2016 and was hospitalized in a psychiatric facility soon afterward.\n\nRecords show he is an American citizen born in Union City, New Jersey and when he was two years old moved with his family to Puerto Rico. He later lived in Anchorage, Alaska, and Naples, Florida.\n\nMaj. Paul Dahlen, a spokesman for the Puerto Rico National Guard, told the Associated Press that Santiago had been deployed to Iraq in 2010 and spent a year-long tour with the 130th Engineer Battalion, the 1013th engineer company out of Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. He had entered the Puerto Rico National Guard back in 2007, served in the reserves starting in 2011, and in 2014 joined the Alaska NG.\n\nThe airport killer was discharged by the Alaska National Guard in 2016 for unsatisfactory performance, according to the AP.\n\nSpeaking to a likely troubled military career, by the time of his discharge Santiago was still a private first class despite some nine years in service.\n\nInfo from Alaska National Guard on Esteban Santiago, @FLLFlyer shooter. pic.twitter.com/2bKO9fm0R1\n\u2014 Kristina Webb (@KristinaWebb) January 6, 2017\n\n\n\nFamily members said Santiago\u00a0seemed to be struggling after his return from Iraq.\n\nSantiago's aunt speaking to Telemundo: Esteban went to Iraq.

When it comes to our foreign policy,\u00a0you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980\u2019s, just like the social policy of the 1950\u2019s, and the economic policies of the 1920\u2019s.\u201d\n\nWhoops! Sorry, got my notes confused. That was Obama making an utter fool of himself during the 2012 presidential debates, with a line his panting\u00a0media lapdogs declared one of the greatest \u201czingers\u201d of all time.\n\nThese days, Obama likes to pretend he is tough on Russia, and the lapdogs have all forgotten what he said four years ago. For the outgoing President who leaves a world in flames for his successor to clean up, the Eighties are so very much back that he might as well give Trump some tips on playing Donkey Kong while he\u2019s at it.\n\nWhat Obama actually said, in a joint press conference with fellow planetary arsonist Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, was this:\n\nI\u2019ve sought a constructive relationship with Russia but what I have also been is realistic in recognizing there is some significant differences in how Russia views the world and how we view the world\nAnd my hope is the president-elect coming in takes a similarly constructive approach: Finding areas where we can cooperate with Russia, where our values and interests align, but also willing to stand up to Russia where they are deviating from our values and international norms.var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([\"embed\"]);\n\nObama also told Trump not to \u201ctake a realpolitik approach\u201d or \u201cjust cut some deals with Russia\u201d:\n\nI don\u2019t expect that the president-elect will follow exactly our blueprint, or our approach, but my hope is that he does not simply take a realpolitik approach, and suggest that if we just cut some deals with Russia, even if it hurts people, or even if it violates international norms, or even if it leaves smaller countries vulnerable, or creates long term problems in regions like Syria, that we just do what is convenient at the time. And that will be something that I think we\u2019ll learn more about as the president-elect puts his team together.\n\nA world emerging from eight years of nonstop Obama disasters can only\u00a0hope Trump won\u2019t be \u201cfollowing his blueprint\u201d \u2013 which, much as Obama apologists will be loathe to admit it, involved a great deal of \u201cjust cutting deals with Russia.\u201d What has Russia wanted under Obama that it didn\u2019t get, short of annexing Poland?\n\nAs ZeroHedge puckishly noted, the Russians were launching strategic bombers, and flinging jet\u00a0fighters off the nose of their aircraft carrier, into Syria even as Obama spoke. (The Russians are also learning that the U.S. Navy only makes aircraft carrier operations\u00a0look\u00a0easy.)\n\nOnce upon a time, Obama was threatening to pelt Damascus with cruise missiles because dictator Bashar Assad stepped over Obama\u2019s infamous \u201cred line\u201d on chemical weapons. Obama then spent years, and piles of money, training ridiculously small white-hat rebel forces, which he sent into Syria on a mission to take down Assad, ISIS,\u00a0and\u00a0al-Qaeda, only to abandon them to unlovely fates.\n\nThroughout this time, Assad and his Russian patrons claimed Obama was just drawing out the bloody Syrian civil war by half-heartedly supporting the rebels, because he was daydreaming about deposing Assad, instead of teaming up with the Syrians and Russians to fight ISIS.\n\nHere\u2019s how intimidated Vladimir Putin was by Barack Obama: the Russians ordered American planes out of Syrian airspace and started bombing the rebels\u00a0the day after\u00a0Putin met with Obama.\n\nObama loved to posture and preen like a tough guy, holding \u201cintense conversations\u201d with Putin where he demanded restraint in Syria, but not much ever came of it. Putin just calmly repeated his (false) assurances that Russia was merely looking to stamp out terrorists, and Obama should join him.\n\nPutin\u00a0thoroughly and comprehensively\u00a0defeated Obama in Syria, down to the last detail, by which I mean \u201cRussians blowing up U.S. allies in Syria while Obama does nothing.\u201d Never mind dealing with Putin \u2013 Trump is going to have a hard time getting erstwhile American allies in Syria to trust the United States, after what Obama did to them.\n\nObama warned about the approach of a \u201cmeaner, harsher, more troubled world\u201d in Berlin, as if he were the last brave defender holding it back, rather than one of the primary architects of the rough times to come. There isn\u2019t a mean, harsh, troubled corner of the Earth that is not significantly worse after eight years of Obama foreign policy. American troops are currently in harm\u2019s way\u00a0on ground in Iraq and an Afghanistan that was won before Obama took charge.\n\nThe big-time bad actors of the world set their dire plans in motion during Obama\u2019s tenure, betting that his diminished America would be unable to stop them. At least one of those Big Bads, Iran, is much richer and more powerful as a direct, intentional result of Obama\u2019s actions. They feel absolutely no gratitude toward the United States for the windfall Obama sent their way.\n\nSyria isn\u2019t exactly a merry romp for Putin, but there\u2019s no question his vision is far closer to prevailing there than Obama\u2019s. Trump takes heat for talking\u00a0in a cooperative, even admiring way about Putin, but we don\u2019t know what he will actually do yet. Obama occasionally talks\u00a0tough about Russia, but his actions haven\u2019t been much of an obstacle to their agenda.\n\nWhatever you can say about \u201crealpolitik,\u201d Obama\u2019s brand of unrealpolitik is an absolute horror show.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.14885497093201, "HarmVice": 7, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 940, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.53569557836, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 6, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161121170000, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 3, "pct_mft_words": 2.97872340425532, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/news/fidel-castro-has-died-at-age-90-brother-says/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 1276, "scraper_regex": 1397}}, "headline": "Cuban Communist Icon Fidel Castro Dead at 90", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1397, "date": "20161126070000", "story_content": "Former President Fidel Castro, who led a rebel army to improbable victory in Cuba, embraced Soviet-style communism and defied the power of 10 U.S. presidents during his half-century rule, has died at age 90.\n\nCastro\u2019s reign over the island-nation 90 miles from Florida was marked by the U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 and the Cuban Missile Crisis a year later that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. The bearded revolutionary, who survived a crippling U.S. trade embargo as well as dozens, possibly hundreds, of assassination plots, died eight years after ill health forced him to formally hand power over to his younger brother Raul, who announced his death late Friday on state television.\n\nCastro overcame imprisonment at the hands of dictator Fulgencio Batista, exile in Mexico and a disastrous start to his rebellion before triumphantly riding into Havana in January 1959 to become, at age 32, the youngest leader in Latin America. For decades, he served as an inspiration and source of support to revolutionaries from Latin America to Africa.\n\nHis commitment to socialism was unwavering, though his power finally began to fade in mid-2006 when a gastrointestinal ailment forced him to hand over the presidency to Raul in 2008, provisionally at first and then permanently. His defiant image lingered long after he gave up his trademark Cohiba cigars for health reasons and his tall frame grew stooped.\n\n\u201cSocialism or death\u201d remained Castro\u2019s rallying cry even as Western-style democracy swept the globe and other communist regimes in China and Vietnam embraced capitalism, leaving this island of 11 million people an economically crippled Marxist curiosity.\n\nHe survived long enough to see Raul Castro negotiate an opening with U.S. President Barack Obama on Dec. 17, 2014, when Washington and Havana announced they would move to restore diplomatic ties for the first time since they were severed in 1961. He cautiously blessed the historic deal with his lifelong enemy in a letter published after a month-long silence.\n\nFidel Castro Ruz was born Aug. 13, 1926, in eastern Cuba\u2019s sugar country, where his Spanish immigrant father worked first recruiting labor for U.S. sugar companies and later built up a prosperous plantation of his own.\n\nCastro attended Jesuit schools, then the University of Havana, where he received law and social science degrees. His life as a rebel began in 1953 with a reckless attack on the Moncada military barracks in the eastern city of Santiago. Most of his comrades were killed and Fidel and his brother Raul went to prison.\n\nFidel turned his trial defense into a manifesto that he smuggled out of jail, famously declaring, \u201cHistory will absolve me.\u201d\n\nFreed under a pardon, Castro fled to Mexico and organized a rebel band that returned in 1956, sailing across the Gulf of Mexico to Cuba on a yacht named Granma. After losing most of his group in a bungled landing, he rallied support in Cuba\u2019s eastern Sierra Maestra mountains.\n\nThree years later, tens of thousands spilled into the streets of Havana to celebrate Batista\u2019s downfall and catch a glimpse of Castro as his rebel caravan arrived in the capital on Jan. 8, 1959.\n\nThe U.S. was among the first to formally recognize his government, cautiously trusting Castro\u2019s early assurances he merely wanted to restore democracy, not install socialism.\n\nWithin months, Castro was imposing radical economic reforms. Members of the old government went before summary courts, and at least 582 were shot by firing squads over two years. Independent newspapers were closed and in the early years, homosexuals were herded into camps for \u201cre-education.\u201d\n\nIn 1964, Castro acknowledged holding 15,000 political prisoners. Hundreds of thousands of Cubans fled, including Castro\u2019s daughter Alina Fernandez Revuelta and his younger sister Juana.\n\nStill, the revolution thrilled millions in Cuba and across Latin America who saw it as an example of how the seemingly arrogant Yankees could be defied. And many on the island were happy to see the seizure of property of the landed class, the expulsion of American gangsters and the closure of their casinos.\n\nCastro\u2019s speeches, lasting up to six hours, became the soundtrack of Cuban life and his 269-minute speech to the U.N. General Assembly in 1960 set the world body\u2019s record for length that still stood more than five decades later.\n\nAs Castro moved into the Soviet bloc, Washington began working to oust him, cutting U.S. purchases of sugar, the island\u2019s economic mainstay. Castro, in turn, confiscated $1 billion in U.S. assets.\n\nThe American government imposed a trade embargo, banning virtually all U.S. exports to the island except for food and medicine, and it severed diplomatic ties on Jan. 3, 1961.\n\nOn April 16 of that year, Castro declared his revolution to be socialist, and the next day, about 1,400 Cuban exiles stormed the beach at the Bay of Pigs on Cuba\u2019s south coast. But the CIA-backed invasion failed.\n\nThe debacle forced the U.S. to give up on the idea of invading Cuba, but that didn\u2019t stop Washington and Castro\u2019s exiled enemies from trying to do him in. By Cuban count, he was the target of more than 630 assassination plots by militant Cuban exiles or the U.S. government.\n\nThe biggest crisis of the Cold War between Washington and Moscow exploded on Oct. 22, 1962, when President John F. Kennedy announced there were Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba and imposed a naval blockade of the island. Humankind held its breath, and after a tense week of diplomacy, Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev removed them. Never had the world felt so close to nuclear war.\n\nCastro cobbled revolutionary groups together into the new Cuban Communist Party, with him as first secretary. Labor unions lost the right to strike. The Catholic Church and other religious institutions were harassed. Neighborhood \u201crevolutionary defense committees\u201d kept an eye on everyone.\n\nCastro exported revolution to Latin American countries in the 1960s, and dispatched Cuban troops to Africa to fight Western-backed regimes in the 1970s. Over the decades, he sent Cuban doctors abroad to tend to the poor, and gave sanctuary to fugitive Black Panther leaders from the U.S.\n\nBut the collapse of the Soviet bloc ended billions in preferential trade and subsidies for Cuba, sending its economy into a tailspin. Castro briefly experimented with an opening to foreign capitalists and limited private enterprise.\n\nAs the end of the Cold War eased global tensions, many Latin American and European countries re-established relations with Cuba. In January 1998, Pope John Paul II visited a nation that had been officially atheist until the early 1990s.\n\nAided by a tourism boom, the economy slowly recovered and Castro steadily reasserted government control, stifling much of the limited free enterprise tolerated during harder times.\n\nAs flamboyant as he was in public, Castro tried to lead a discreet private life. He and his first wife, Mirta Diaz Balart, had one son before divorcing in 1956. Then, for more than four decades, Castro had a relationship with Dalia Soto del Valle. They had five sons together and were said to have married quietly in 1980.\n\nBy the time Castro resigned 49 years after his triumphant arrival in Havana, he was the world\u2019s longest ruling head of government, aside from monarchs.\n\nIn retirement, Castro voiced unwavering support as Raul slowly but deliberately enacted sweeping changes to the Marxist system he had built.\n\nHis longevity allowed the younger brother to consolidate control, perhaps lengthening the revolution well past both men\u2019s lives. In February 2013, Raul announced that he would retire as president in 2018 and named newly minted Vice President Miguel Diaz-Canel as his successor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be 90 years old soon,\u201d Castro said at an April 2016 communist party congress where he made his most extensive public appearance in years. \u201cSoon I\u2019ll be like all the others. The time will come for all of us, but the ideas of the Cuban Communists will remain as proof that on this planet, if one works with fervor and dignity, they can produce the material and cultural goods that human beings need and that need to be fought for without ever giving up.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press writer Michael Weissenstein reported this story in Havana and Peter Orsi reported from Mexico City.

Trump\u2019s secretary of state told Breitbart News, when\u00a0President\u00a0Abdel Fattah al-Sisi \u00a0pulled his country\u2019s United Nations resolution condemning Israel at Trump\u2019s request, he proved he was a friend of the United States.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a defender of all the good things that we believe in,\u201d\u00a0said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R.-Calif.) about his friend al-Sisi,\u00a0with whom he has met several times.\n\n\u201cI think al-Sisi is absolutely essential to our national security,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s alot more important to our national security and defeating our primary enemy, which is radical Islamic terrorism\u2013he\u2019s more important than having a new full division in the Army and he\u2019s certainly more important to our national security than the F-35.\u201d The Lighting II, or F-35, is a single-pilot fighter jet produced by Lockheed Martin. Rohrabacher is a long-time critic of the program\u2019s costs and substandard performance.\n\nIn the days before Christmas, on Wednesday, the Egyptian government submitted a resolution to the United Nations Security Council that condemned Israel for building new settlements on lands captured by Israel after Arab invasions, such as the 1967 War. Then, after Trump spoke to al-Sisi, the Egyptian government withdrew the resolution on Thursday. But, the resolution went forward Friday, resubmitted by New Zealand, Malaysia, Senegal, and Venezuela. It has always been American policy to veto UN resolutions that condemn Israel. But, when the votes were cast Friday, the tally was 14-0-1. the one abstention was the United States. In the end, Egypt, which first proposed the resolution for internal politic reasons, ended up voting for the condemnation; but clearly by pulling the measure Thursday, al-Sisi and Egypt made a bold step in a new direction, just as Obama made a bold statement in a new direction.\n\nRohrabacher said he wants Congress to recognize that al-Sisi\u2019s working with Trump to protect Israel is a concrete signal that Egypt is our partner for peace.\n\n\u201cHis courage in doing that really did demonstrate what a great partnership we can have with the Egyptian people, as long as they have leadership of the quality of General al-Sisi,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI would hope that my colleagues open their eyes, when Egypt is doing something as important as that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe wants peace in the Middle East, he\u2019s willing to embrace Israel and promote peace in that region. He protects Christians and others\u2013al-Sisi\u2019s the guy.\u201d said the congressman,\u00a0who co-chairs the House Egypt Caucus.\n\nRohrabacher said al-Sisi defeated the Muslim Brotherhood \u2014 supported by Obama \u2014\u00a0which quickly became an anti-American, jihadist government that was undermining civility in Egypt.\n\nObama\u2019s behind-the-scenes maneuvering to make sure the resolution was brought back for a vote was infuriating, the congressman said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how upset I am at Obama for doing this in the first place,\u201d he said. \u00a0\u201cThis wasn\u2019t just betraying Israel, it was betraying America\u2019s interest\u2013Israel just happens to be one of those countries that is bearing the brunt of the radical Islamic movement, which, of course, is dedicated to destroying western civilization.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s handling of the UN resolution was a major mistake for another reason: It sent the wrong signal to our allies, he said. \u201cWhat ally can rely on us now? Hopefully, Trump can regain the faith of people around the world, who think of themselves as America\u2019s allies.\u201d\n\nThe congressman said one of the ways the Trump administration can help bolster al-Sisi and Egypt is to reverse the Obama administration\u2019s cash-on-delivery policy for selling arms to Egypt. While other allied nations pay for military supplies from the United States with 20 percent down and the rest paid off in 20 percent installments annually, Egypt has to pay for all American military supplies with cash-on-the-barrelhead.\n\n\u201cWe changed the rules on al-Sisi,\u201d Rohrabacher said. \u201cHere they are on the front line of the front line\u2013if Egypt goes the whole Middle East goes\u2013and yet, what we have done is make it all but impossible for al-Sisi to buy the weapons from us.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s cash-and-carry program for Egypt damaged Egypt\u2019s ability to defend itself, maintain order, and to be a force for good in the region, he said.\n\nWhen Congress returns to Washington in the first week of January, the one-time folk singer, campus activist, and screenwriter said he is filing legislation to reverse Obama\u2019s\u00a0cash-and-carry program for Egypt.\n\nMoving forward, although he is not joining the Trump administration, Rohrabacher said he will work with the administration by connecting Trump\u2019s team with relationships he has built up around the world starting with his days as a college student in Vietnam\u2013during the Vietnam War\u2013to his friends among the Kurds and the tribes inside Iran resisting that regime.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 13, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -0.668896317481995, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 771, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 3, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.354156369030001, "HarmVirtue": 12, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 40, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 1, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161227030000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 5.188067444876781, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.6363636363599996}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/11/14/gop-congressman-mo-brooks-paul-ryans-position-immigration-not-best-interest-america/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [236, 326, 413, 437, 552, 635, 659, 696, 990, 3012, 3615, 3733, 3849, 3859, 4328, 4641, 4714, 4746, 4923, 4945, 5451, 5558, 5596, 5672, 6263, 6451, 6495, 6528, 6547, 6704, 7136, 7148, 7241]}}, "headline": "GOP Rep: Paul Ryan's Immigration Policy Not 'in Best Interest of America'", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1370, "date": "20161114230000", "story_content": "House Speaker Paul Ryan's immigration policy is not \u201cin the best interest of America,\" says Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks.\n\nLawmakers are set to hold leadership elections\u00a0this coming Tuesday. Yet, in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, Brooks indicated\u00a0that he is not sure whether he will support the re-election of Speaker Ryan, who has a\u00a0two-decade long history\u00a0of championing open borders immigration policies.\n\n\"It depends on the President-elect's preferences,' Brooks tells\u00a0Breitbart.\n\nIn 2015, Brooks voted to elect Ryan as Speaker of the House after Ryan\u00a0personally promised him\u00a0that he would not bring up any major\u00a0immigration legislation while President Barack Obama was still in office.\n\nYet Ryan swiftly broke that promise by quadrupling the controversial H-2B guest worker program in his omnibus spending bill, which immigration attorney Ian Smith explained would disproportionately \"hurt America's most \u00a0vulnerable workers\u201d by allowing them to be replaced by temporary foreign workers.\n\n\"I don't believe that Paul Ryan's position on immigration is consistent with what is in the best interest of America,\" Brooks told Breitbart. \"But that's why we have these policy debates and disagreements. I would prefer someone who is stronger on immigration, but Paul Ryan has assured me, again, for this next session of Congress\u2014as he did during the last year, in which he was Speaker\u2014 that no bill on immigration will come to the House floor unless a majority of the GOP conference supports it.\"\n\nBreitbart News followed up.\n\nBreitbart: \"Well, last year he did put into the omnibus\u2026 [an] expansion to the H-2B visa program\u2014 even though he made that promise.\"\nBrooks: \"I understand.\"\nBreitbart: \"Do you think [he'll keep] his promise this time\u2026 better than last time?\"\nBrooks: \"I don't know.\"\n\nFollowing Ryan's broken promise, Congressman Brooks took to the House floor in January and declared:\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan claims increasing foreign worker visas [quote] \"help[s] small businesses who cannot find labor when there's a surge in demand for their labor like seafood processing, or tourism.\" [end quote] This claimed labor shortage is unsupported by jobs or wage data and is political bunk!\n\n\"Mr. Speaker, while these surges in foreign worker visas and foreign labor work permits is a huge victory for special interests that profit from suppressed wages, it is a debilitating loss for struggling American families,\" Brooks said. \"Unemployed and underpaid Americans desperate for a good-paying job have every right to be angry at a federal government that takes American jobs from American citizens and gives them to foreigners.\"\n\nPerhaps presciently, Brooks added: \"Americans have every right to be angry at Washington elected officials who care more about special interest campaign contributions than American voters who elected us. I hope these Americans will remember their anger during 2016's primary and general elections.\u00a0 That is the way to force Washington to represent us!\"\n\n\"Mr. Speaker, I can't speak for anyone else but, as for me, Mo Brooks, from Alabama's 5th Congressional District, I fight for the economic interests of American citizens and against policies that undermine the struggling American voters who sent us here,\" Brooks concluded.\n\nAccording to Pew polling data, 92 percent of the GOP electorate is opposed to Ryan's expansionist immigration agenda.\n\nReports analyzing Trump's historic upset suggest that the American people did indeed \"remember their anger\" over Ryan and political elites\u2019 expansionist\u00a0immigration policies that put foreign interests ahead of the interests of American workers.\n\nYet Brooks now indicates\u00a0he is undecided on whether he will vote to re-elect as House Speaker a man who has been one of Washington's biggest\u00a0advocates\u00a0of open borders.\n\n\"The Speaker's race\u2026 all really comes down to one thing,\u201d Brooks says. \u201cYou can throw out the public policy, you can throw out all the personalities, it comes down to whether Donald Trump wants Paul Ryan as Speaker of the House.\"\n\nWhen asked if he thinks his constituents who just propelled Trump to victory want Ryan as House Speaker, Brooks said \"my constituency wants Donald Trump's wishes respected.\u201d\n\nAs to his own preferences, Brooks explained:\u00a0\"I strongly prefer strong, aggressive leadership on behalf of Republican ideas rather than wishy-washy compromising leadership. In the context of the Speaker's race, if Hillary Clinton had been elected president, we would definitely need a House Speaker with a stronger backbone [than Ryan].\"\n\nYet, as proponents\u00a0of immigration controls have noted, Ryan has demonstrated that he can be\u00a0quite forceful when it comes to\u00a0his efforts to push for expansionist immigration policies.\n\n\"There is nobody around in the party who is more fanatically dedicated to the cause of open borders than Paul Ryan,\"\u00a0Conservative Review's\u00a0Daniel Horowitz has explained. \"Whereas most others could be talked off the ledge on this issue, Ryan is a true believer.\"\n\n\"Open borders is in his ideological DNA,\" Roy Beck, the president of the immigration control group NumbersUSA, has explained. \"He's an ideologue and has spent his whole life working for ideologues. Open borders seeps out of every pore of his being\u2026 This isn't personal, it's just who he is\u2026 Ryan is the heart and soul of crony capitalism.\"\n\nIndeed, Brooks himself seemed to suggest\u00a0that if Ryan were elected Speaker, much of Trump's efforts to enact his mandate on curbing immigration may\u00a0have to be done against the wishes of\u00a0Speaker Ryan. When asked about Ryan's recent comments on CNN, in which Ryan\u00a0indicated that the removing illegal aliens is not going to be a \"focus\" of a Trump administration, Brooks said:\n\n\"The President of the United States can enforce our immigration laws without any help from the United States Congress. The laws are already on the books. So if Donald Trump wants to secure our border and enforce our immigration law, he has the power to do that regardless of what the Majority Leader of the Senate or the Speaker of the House may think, do, or say.\"\n\n\u201c[I] strongly disagree with him [Ryan] on whether the importation of huge amounts of foreign labor is good for\u00a0struggling American families,\u201d Brooks added. \u201cI believe it costs struggling America families jobs. And those lucky enough to get jobs will suffer from wage suppression as a consequence of\u00a0the floodgates having been opened\u2014 not only\u00a0for illegal aliens, but also for\u00a0lawful immigrants.\u00a0If we had a booming economy, it would be one thing. But we don't. We have an anemic economy. And Americans are suffering because of our open borders policy.\u00a0The economic data is clear and irrefutable.

Gutierrez has previously said, \"I have only one loyalty\u2026and that's to the immigrant community.\"\n\nAt a joint event with Gutierrez in 2013, Ryan made the case for dissolving borders\u2014declaring unabashedly that America \"is more than our borders.\"\n\nIn fact, in 2015, Gutierrez was one of Ryan's earliest supporters for his election as House Speaker.\n\nIt is unclear whether members of the House Freedom Caucus and conservative lawmakers\u2014including Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows, Jeff Duncan, Jim Bridenstine, Brian Babin, Steve King, Matt Salmon, Alex Mooney, Gary Palmer, Barry Loudermilk, John Fleming and others\u2014who voted for Ryan last year, share Gutierrez's previously expressed support for Ryan and whether they will vote to elect him again as House Speaker on Tuesday.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 14, "AuthorityVice": 4, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.30548298358917, "HarmVice": 6, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1344, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 12, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 8.26923003001, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 28, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 28, "mft_sum": 69, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161114230000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 6.27272727273, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 2, "pct_mft_words": 5.13392857142857, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/education/2016/12/30/exclusive-ronald-reagans-education-secretary-devos-will-lead-conservative-education-reform-for-all-americas-children/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Exclusive \u2014 Ronald Reagan\u2019s Education Secretary: DeVos Will Lead Conservative Education Reform for All America's Children", "wordcount_as_scraped": 783, "date": "20161230150000", "story_content": "President-elect Donald Trump changed the direction of the nation\u2019s education conversation with a single name \u2013 Betsy DeVos. By nominating a champion of school choice and local control for Secretary of Education, Trump sent the teachers\u2019 unions into panic.\n\nRandi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, tweeted, \"Trump has chosen the most ideological, anti-public ed nominee since the creation of the Dept of Education.\"\n\nWith that kind of backlash, it\u2019s obvious that DeVos is a threat to the unions, and indeed, she is. She is a bona fide education reformer. She\u2019s a private citizen who has made her career in education challenging the status quo and protectors of the status quo. She fits Trump\u2019s agenda as an outsider intent on taking on the establishment and \"draining the swamp.\"\n\nLest we forget, this election was not about tweaking the direction of the country or subtle shifts in the nation\u2019s political landscape. Rather, it was a wholesale rejection of the Washington establishment and a call for dramatic change. According to the exit polls, when asked which candidate quality mattered the most in determining their vote for president, 39 percent of voters said \"can bring change\" \u2013 by far the highest category of voter concerns. Among these voters yearning for change, Trump won by a margin of 82 percent to 14 percent. DeVos embodies that type of change.\n\nFor the past 28 years, DeVos has been one of the most outspoken conservative voices for expanded school choice. She helped Michigan pass its first charter school legislation in the early 1990s. She believes parents should have a much larger voice in how and where their children are educated. DeVos has fought against the teachers\u2019 unions in dozens of state capitals for charter schools and private school vouchers, and she has stood with parents who decide to home school their children. Her philosophy on education is simple: public dollars should serve the public. By allowing K-12 dollars to follow children to the best school available to them, whether it is a traditional public school, private school or virtual school, all schools in our K-12 system will be held accountable and forced to improve their performance.\n\nPresident-elect Trump has promised to cut Washington bureaucracy and send more federal education dollars back to governors so they can expand school choice in their states. There is no one better in America to help our new President make his case that more school choice will lead to better outcomes for our school children than Betsy DeVos. She has helped thousands of school children find access to better schools. Her impact has been felt in the lives of at-risk children who have been able to escape underperforming and dangerous public schools because of access to private and charter schools of choice.\n\nAnother way DeVos will bring change to Washington is by greatly reducing the federal government's role in K-12 education. DeVos is a strong supporter of state and local control. She understands that the heavy hand of Washington has imposed layers of costly red tape on our schools, wasting tax dollars on bureaucracy instead of driving improvement in student learning. In picking Betsy DeVos to champion his education agenda, President Trump has shown that he is committed to reducing the power of the federal government over local education policy and decision making.\n\nConservatives should also have no doubts about DeVos' opposition to federalized Common Core. She has stated unequivocally that she is opposed to Washington imposing the Common Core or any other set of standards on the states. President-elect Trump ran and won on a promise to end Barack Obama's intrusion into our kids' classrooms.\n\nThere is a reason that the teacher's unions have launched a vicious series of misleading attacks on DeVos since her nomination was announced in November. They have smeared her for being a devout Christian and for wanting to give children the right to attend private schools that teach religion. They have attacked her for using her personal resources to fight for conservative education reform. They have even falsely attacked her as a racist. The union leaders know full-well that she is a tough, courageous and principled conservative reformer who will take them on every day to fight for the interests of parents and students. That's why they are resorting to every ugly tactic in their playbook.\n\nBetsy DeVos is highly regarded in the conservative education reform movement. And for good reason. The Republican majority in the Senate should confirm her so she can go about the business of getting Washington, D.C. out of our children's classrooms and getting learning back in.\n\nMr. Bennett served as Secretary of Education from 1985-1988 under Ronald Reagan.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 8, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -3.3047735691070597, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 772, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 5, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 7, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.93736262207, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 23, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20161230150000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.9792746113989597, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 2.09090909091}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/12/29/philippine-president-admits-throwing-man-helicopter-threatens/": {"warnings": {}, "headline": "Philippines\u2019 Duterte Threatens to Throw Corrupt Officials Out of Helicopter", "wordcount_as_scraped": 722, "date": "20161230020000", "story_content": "Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte reportedly threatened to throw corrupt officials out of a helicopter in the same manner he did a Chinese man suspected of rape and murder years ago.\n\nAlthough he later described his threat as a joke in an interview with CNN, Duterte's administration had already admitted to the news network that the president had actually carried out the helicopter killing.\n\nThe Washington Post (WaPo) reports:\n\nDuterte first made the claim during a speech on a northern island that had been hit by a deadly typhoon.\nHe announced that he was going to provide millions of dollars in aid to the victims, the Philippine Star reported, then changed the subject to the campaign against drugs and corruption that fueled his rise to power.\n\nDuterte's most recent shocking confession is not unprecedented.\n\nAs the man behind the drug war that has killed thousands, the Filipino leader has boasted about his bloody reputation, calling himself more brutal than the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) jihadist group and claiming last month that he executed several criminals during the 22 years he spent as mayor of Davao City, in the south of the country.\n\nAs in the past, his administration quickly dismissed Duterte's recent confession that he threw a man out of a helicopter as hyperbole.\n\n\u201cIf you are corrupt, I will fetch you using a helicopter to Manila and I will throw you out,\" Duterte reportedly said in a threat that won applause from a crowd of typhoon survivors in the Camarines Sur province on Tuesday. \"I have done this before, why would I not do it again?\u201d\n\n\"I'll throw you at a low altitude, not that high, because in the length of the fall you may be able to develop wings, just at the right [altitude] so the impact of your crash won't be heard,\" he added. \n\nA spokesman for Duterte described the alleged incident as an \u201curban legend.\u201d\n\nTwo days after threatening to toss corrupt officials out of a helicopter, the Philippine president told CNN he was just kidding.\n\n\"We had no helicopter; we don\u2019t use that,\" he declared, calling the literal interpretation of his early allegation \"creative imagination.\"\n\n\"I am playing you\u2026 your team knows I really want to say jokes,\" also said Duterte.\n\nNevertheless, his comments have prompted condemnation from the international community and created tensions with the United Nations and the United States, which the Philippine president has accused of trying to destabilize and ultimately overthrow his administration.\n\nPresident Barack Obama's State Department has dismissed the allegations as \u201cfalse.\u201d\n\nTo the ire of Duterte, the Obama administration has repeatedly denounced what the international community deems extrajudicial killings at the behest of the Philippine leader who believes killing criminals is not a crime.\n\nOn Thursday, Duterte denounced U.S. ambassadors as \"spies\" in response to an article published by the Manila Times on Tuesday that highlights an alleged American plot to overthrow the Filipino president.\n\nThe Manila Times reports, \u201cIn brief, the plan calls on the US government to employ a combination of socio-economic-political-diplomatic moves against Duterte \u2018to bring him to his knees and eventually remove him from office.\u2019\n\nSince Duterte took office on June 30, more than 6,000 people have been killed as a result of his anti-drug campaign.\n\n\"Some were gunned down during encounters with police who were acting under the government\u2019s orders, while others were killed by unknown vigilantes,\" notes WaPo.\n\nZeid Raad al-Hussein, the United Nations human rights chief, has urged the Philippine courts to launch a murder investigation of Duterte who has \"openly admitted to being a killer.\"\n\nAlluding to his allegation that he threw a man out of a helicopter, CBS News points out, \"Many Filipinos appear to take his broad claims in stride, as his domestic popularity remains high.\"\n\n\"The president's past extreme comments against suspected drug pushers and corrupt officials have left many wondering if he was exaggerating, and administration officials have said he often uses hyperbole as a scare tactic,\" it adds.\n\nDuterte said the primary goal of his drug war is to eradicate the Philippines's massive drug problems \"to preserve the interest of the next generation.\"\n\n\"If you destroy my country, I\u2019ll kill you. That\u2019s a legitimate thing,\" declared the Philippine president. \"If you destroy our young children, I will kill you.

The holiday season, in particular, provides additional opportunities for violent extremists to target public events and places where people congregate.\nThough we know of no intelligence that is both specific and credible at this time of a plot by terrorist organizations to attack the homeland, the reality is terrorist-inspired individuals have conducted, or attempted to conduct, attacks in the United States.\n\nThe NTAS bulletin, issued November 15, noted that the DHS and the FBI are collaborating with the private sector as well as state, local, and tribal partners to deal with the current threat environment.\n\nAhead of the Thanksgiving Day Parade and Black Friday shopping, the New York Police Department (NYPD) expressed concern about the ISIS magazine and has stepped up security as a result.\n\nIn response to the deadly Nice attack and the recent ISIS threat, the NYPD has added a new layer of security this year's annual parade by placing heavy sand trucks at cross streets along the parade to protect from any attack involving vehicles.\n\n\u201cI think this year you are going to see a lot more blocker cars and sand trucks on the cross streets,\u201d revealed New York City Police Commissioner James O\u2019Neill.\n\n\u201cThe Nice attack was an indicator of something we had to make adjustments because of,\u201d added New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. \u201cThat\u2019s why the sand trucks are there.

And when it is your door they kick against, a great measure of confidence can be derived from a trusty shotgun.\n\nWith these things in mind\u2013and with Christmas fast approaching\u2013Breitbart News thought it apropos to compile a list of five home defense shotguns, any one of which would make a great addition to your Christmas wish list.\n\nRemington 870\u2013The Remington 870 is a classic, American pump shotgun in .12 gauge or 20 gauge. (If you are shopping for a single mother or an elderly relative, the 20 gauge may be the wiser choice for the reduced recoil.) The 870 is the go-to shotgun for police departments and law enforcement agencies around the country. It is durable, proven, and easy to use, which makes it a great shotgun choice when you are looking for a firearm that is chiefly being acquired to use in life or death situations.\n\nThe 870 is available with numerous variations, but if you are buying for home defense the 870 Express is the way to go.\n\nApproximate price on an 870 Express is $400-$430.\n\n\n\nMossberg 500 Persuader\u2013The Mossberg 500 Persuader is another classic pump shotgun on a classic pump shotgun platform; by the latter I mean that a model 500 can be acquired in a multitude of configurations. The Persuader model is especially designated for home defense and it has the magazine capacity to prove it. A Persuader holds eight 12 gauge rounds in the magazine and one in the chamber, for a total of nine. A capacity of that size, coupled with the Persuader\u2019s durability, make it hard to find a shotgun better suited for convincing home invaders that they picked the wrong house.\n\nIt should be noted that\u00a0Guns and Ammo magazine chose the 500 as \u201cthe best home defense shotgun of all time\u201d in 2013.\n\nApproximate price on the base model Mossberg 500 Persuader is $350-$370.\n\n\n\nWinchester SXP Defender\u2013The Winchester SXP Defender is a pump shotgun chambered in 12 gauge. It is Winchester\u2019s home defense shotgun and it functions like the Remington 870 or the Mossberg 500. The SXP Defender also makes a great camp gun and because of this, Winchester advertises it as \u201ceasy to pack.\u201d It has as five round magazine capacity plus one in the chamber for a total of six rounds of 3 inch 12 gauge firepower.\n\nApproximate price on the SXP Defender is $350-$370.\n\n\n\nSavage/Stevens 320 Pump\u2013The Savage/Stevens 320 Pump shotgun is also a classic pump shotgun with a couple of twists: 1. It has comes with a pistol grip. 2. It offers a solid platform for the lower recoil 20 gauge round. This makes this a great gun for women, elderly individuals, or anyone who wants a shotgun without the 12 gauge recoil. This is a shotgun that a single mother can quickly master and thereafter keep at the ready\u2013in a safe location of her choosing\u2013for the purposes of defending herself and her children if someone with bad intentions forces their way into the home.\n\nApproximate price on the Savage/Stevens 320 Pump is $225-$250.\n\n\n\nTaurus Judge Revolvers\u2013Taurus Judge revolvers are not actually shotguns but a family of revolvers designed to fire .410 gauge shotgun shells; this means they are especially suited for self and home-defense. The Judge shook up the handgun market when introduced a decade ago, much as the Glock brand of handguns shook up the market in the 1980s. The Judge allows people weighing home defense options to have the advantages of a shotgun shell in a compact\u2013and in some cases, concealable\u2013revolver platform. The Judge has inspired myriad options in .410 ammunition, including Federal\u2019s 410 Handgun line and Hornady\u2019s Critical Defense rounds.\n\nThere are a number of different Judge configurations, from compact to full size and everything in between. Configurations also include Judge revolvers made of various materials, from steel to a combination of steel and titanium or polymer.\n\nApproximate price on a Taurus Judge is $600 and up.\n\n\n\nAs with all firearm purchases, it is crucial that you buy a gun suited to your physical size and ability, and that you become familiar with it before relying on it for self-defense. A shotgun is an exceedingly efficient means of home defense when it is resting in the hands of someone who has taken time to familiarize themselves with it. Such efficiency can also be derived from Taurus Judge revolvers; it all comes down to which gun appeals most to you.\n\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of \"Bullets with AWR Hawkins,\" a Breitbart News podcast.

Thank you.\n\nFrom there, however, Trump went full populist nationalist and never turned back.\n\nToday\u2019s ceremony, however, has a very special meaning because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people. For too long, a small group in our nation\u2019s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have bore the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered but the jobs left and the factories closed. The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs. And while they celebrated in our nation\u2019s capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land. That all changes starting right here and right now, because this moment is your moment. It belongs to you. It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. This is your day. This is your celebration. And this, the United States of America, is your country. What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people. January 20th, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.\n\nPresident Trump positioned himself as the champion for the \"forgotten\" working class men and women across America, before he delved into several policy specifics:\n\nThe forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. Everyone is listening to you now. You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement, the likes of which the world has never seen before. At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families and good jobs for themselves. These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public. But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists. Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities, rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation. An education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge. And the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now. We are one nation, and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams, and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home and one glorious destiny. The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.\n\nTrump said that under his presidency, which officially began a little after noon as\u00a0Chief Justice Roberts administered the Oath of Office, America will stop handling other nations' problems before handling America's problems. \"America First,\" a key mantra of his campaign for the presidency, was the centerpiece of his speech.\u00a0He went on to say:\n\nFor many decades we\u2019ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military. We\u2019ve defended other nations\u2019 borders while refusing to defend our own. And we\u2019ve spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America\u2019s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay. We\u2019ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon. One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind. The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world. But that is the past, and now we are looking only to the future. We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it\u2019s going to be only America first, America first. Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our product, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never ever let you down.\n\nTrump said next that under his now officially started presidency, \"America will start winning again, winning like never before\" and that \"we will bring back our jobs\" and \"we will bring back our borders.\" The speech continued:\n\nWe will bring back our wealth, and we will bring back our dreams. We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation. We will get our people off of welfare and back to work, rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor. We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and hire American. We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first. We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example. We will shine for everyone to follow. We will re-enforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the earth. At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.\n\nTrump cited the Bible and called for Americans to \"open your heart to patriotism,\" where there is \"no room for prejudice.\" And he called for a united, and strong, America. He said:\n\nWe must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity. When America is united, America is totally unstoppable. There should be no fear. We are protected and we will always be protected. We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement. And most importantly, we will be protected by God. Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger. In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving. We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.\n\nPresident Trump said the \"time for empty talk is over\" and \"now arrives the hour of action,\" adding that nobody should \"allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done.\" Trump said:\n\nNo challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America. We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again. We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow. A new national pride will stir ourselves, lift our sights and heal our divisions. It\u2019s time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget, that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots. We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms and we all salute the same great American flag. And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator.\"\n\nThe newly inaugurated president wrapped his inaugural address with his campaign slogan.\n\n\"Together we will make America strong again, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again,\" President Trump said. \"And, yes, together we will make America great again.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 39, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 2.14741730690002, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1556, "FairnessVirtue": 5, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 10, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 4, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 10.787963908399998, "HarmVirtue": 13, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 5, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 4, "mft_max": 39, "mft_sum": 80, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170120220000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 5.141388174807201, "mft_mean": 7.27272727273}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/news/donald-trump-is-an-avowed-sinner-so-why-did-evangelicals-vote-for-him/": {"warnings": {"wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 898, "scraper_regex": 948}}, "headline": "Donald Trump is an avowed sinner \u2014 so why did evangelicals vote for him?", "wordcount_as_scraped": 948, "date": "20161112020000", "story_content": " Evangelicals, or born-again Christians, account for approximately 25.4 percent of the U.S. population \u2013 and Donald Trump should thank them for their support. Exit polls show that roughly 80 percent of white evangelicals voted for Trump. That percentage is even higher than George W. Bush received from the faithful in 2000 and 2004. \n\nClearly, Baptists, pentecostals, charismatics and others were willing to overlook Trump\u2019s myriad sins: the misogyny, the implicit and explicit racism, the religious bigotry, his remarks about never having asked God for forgiveness. On the whole, they thought, Trump would uphold their values. \n\nHe would appoint Supreme Court justices who had strong pro-life credentials. Trump promised to support religious liberty laws, which allow private businesses to deny service to individuals they deem sinful (read: homosexual). \n\nTrump\u2019s running mate Mike Pence fought a hard battle as governor of Indiana to maintain that state\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which relaxes anti-discrimination restrictions on businesses. The Pew Research Center reports that \u201cevangelicals also overwhelmingly prefer Trump to Clinton when it comes to handling a wide variety of specific issues, from gun policy to the economy, terrorism, immigration and abortion.\u201d \n\nWhite evangelicals made their decision as the American political landscape darkened noticeably. Sure, mudslinging, character assassination and downright nastiness have long been part of the dark art of politics in the United States since the days when candidates wore knee breeches and powdered wigs. What\u2019s different now is that the nastiness emanates from the candidate himself. In years gone by, largely anonymous party hacks did the dirtiest work; in 2016, Trump did it himself. \n\nAnd yet, millions of conservative white Christians turned out for him. Why?\n\nWillful ignorance\n\nTheir willingness to forgive Trump his sins was no secret. During the firestorm over the Access Hollywood tape in which Trump bragged about his sexual prowess and lewd attitudes toward women, Jerry Falwell, Jr. proclaimed: \u201cWe\u2019re all sinners, every one of us. We\u2019ve all done things we wish we hadn\u2019t.\u201d \n\nTo further allay fears of those within the fold, Franklin Graham, son of famous evangelist Billy Graham, assured fellow believers that everyone has sinned, and that God had used many individuals in the Bible who had deep flaws, including King David and Moses. Perhaps they now hope the Trump presidency will turn out to be little short of a true Biblical epic.\n\nAfter the election, Graham\u2019s Facebook page said that the massive Republican victory had divine roots. \u201cPolitical pundits are stunned,\u201d he wrote triumphantly. \u201cMany thought the Trump/Pence ticket didn\u2019t have a chance. None of them understand the God-factor.\u201d \n\nBut there was something else at work besides the \u201cGod-factor,\u201d something that doesn\u2019t get covered in the press all that much: Trump is as committed a knowledge-denier as many of the evangelicals are. \n\nAnother world\n\nFor years, evangelical Christians stood firm on the front lines of the culture war, which they regarded as a fight against the agents of secularism, pluralism, political correctness and science. To paraphrase Michael Gove, Britain\u2019s former justice secretary and staunch Brexit campaigner, evangelicals have long been saying: We have had enough of experts. \n\nWith the far-right Breitbart News Network in his corner, Trump grounded his campaign in conspiracy-driven politics and bold-faced lies. Before voting in the primaries even began, the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s FactCheck.org reported that:\n\n\u201cIn the 12 years of FactCheck.org\u2019s existence, we\u2019ve never seen [Donald Trump\u2019s] match \u2026 He stands out not only for the sheer number of his factually false claims but also for his brazen refusals to admit error when proven wrong.\u201d\n\nApproximately 64 percent of white evangelicals reject human evolutionary science; like Pence has done, many of them also promote what\u2019s known as \u201cconversion therapy,\u201d pseudoscientific treatments purported to \u201ccure\u201d people of homosexuality; and they lash out at the \u201cliberal media\u201d and the professorial overlords of left-leaning colleges and universities. Evangelicals believe that Trump will protect them from the onslaughts of secularism at a time when traditional Christianity is losing ground in the United States.\n\nIn 2015, 37 percent of evangelicals polled said \u201cthere is no solid evidence that the earth is getting warmer.\u201d Another 33 percent believed that global warming is happening, but that it is not caused by human activities. They probably cheered at the sight of a notorious Trump tweet from 2012, which read: \u201cThe concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive\u201d\u201d \n\n\nPerhaps not wanting to disappoint the devout, Trump has just named arch-climate change denier Myron Ebell to head his Environmental Protection Agency transition team. White evangelicals may also be elated to know that fellow Christian conservative and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, of \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d fame, is being considered for Secretary of the Interior.\n\nAnd so here we are, at the end of what the New York Times recently called an \u201cexhausting parade of ugliness.\u201d That\u2019s an apt description \u2013 but this particular parade has now been extended by at least four years. We can expect Trump to stay vulgar, cavalier and ill-informed once he\u2019s sworn in as president in January. He will keep up his brazen denials of truth, keep pandering to the bitter angels of the white mob\u2019s nature and keep piling on the invective.\n\nEvangelicals, like many others who voted Republican on Tuesday, see in Trump a powerful, non-establishment figure, who will shake up Washington and champion their values. In a matter of months, the scales may fall from their eyes.\n\nRandall Stephens is a reader in history and American studies at Northumbria University, Newcastle.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

It will be interesting to see if Democrats can reconcile their newfound devotion to information security with President Obama\u2019s clemency for WikiLeaks source Chelsea Manning.\n\nNext came North Korea (64 percent), Russia (54 percent), and China (52 percent). Interestingly but not surprisingly, given the media focus after the election, Russia is now viewed as a top threat by more Democrats (67 percent) than Republicans (41 percent), quite possibly for the first time in the history of opinion polling. Overall, Russia picked up 12 points on Pew's threat-o-meter since last April, when only 42 percent of respondents described it as a major threat.\n\nRounding out the top survey results for perceived national security threats were global climate change, tied with China at 52 percent; the large number of refugees from Iraq and Syria at 46 percent; and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at 43 percent.\n\nPew notes there is a strong partisan divide in many of these assessments, most significantly on climate change (viewed as a major threat by 77 percent of Democrats vs. only 25 percent of Republicans) and refugees (63 percent Republican, 30 percent Democrat).\n\nThe partisan gap on Russia was impressive as well and, as mentioned above, a complete inversion from the predilections of the two parties just a few years ago. 67 percent of Democrats now say Russia's power and influence is a major threat, compared to just 41 percent of Republicans.\n\nPew also points out that while the Israeli-Palestinian situation is seen as worrisome by roughly equivalent percentages of Democrats and Republicans, there is an enormous split over which side each party sympathizes with. \n\n74 percent of Republicans said they side with Israel, while only 11 percent side with the Palestinians, and 15 percent had mixed opinions. For Democrats, 33 percent sided with Israel, 33 percent with the Palestinians, and 35 percent had mixed opinions. Pew states that the Republican numbers have been fairly constant over the last few years, and Democrats\u2019 sympathy for Israel fell 10 points over the past year. The gap between the two parties is now the largest recorded since 1978. \n\nThe two parties also have almost exactly inverse opinions of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: 50%/22% positive for Republicans, 45%/21% negative for Democrats. Self-identified \u201cliberal Democrats\u201d have an exceptionally poor view of Netanyahu.\n\nOne other finding of significance as President Trump proceeds with his first Hundred Days: public opinion of the United Nations is 62 percent positive, largely unchanged from last year's rating. Here again, there is a very large partisan gap, as 81 percent of Democrats view the UN favorably, while only 44 percent of Republicans do. \n\nTrump has been strongly critical of the United Nations, especially its recent anti-Israel vote, and a bill to withdraw America from the United Nations has been introduced by Rep.

We\u2019re backing the jihadists. And this is what we\u2019ve done consistently.\"\n\nStranahan explained how during the Arab Spring, the Obama administration had supported other Middle Eastern groups that supported strict Sharia law, using Egypt as an example, saying that under Obama, American foreign policy \"supported Hosni Mubarak leaving. We helped get Hosni Mubarak out of there, and then immediately he was replaced by the Muslim Brotherhood, who inserted Sharia law. Now, the Egyptian people didn\u2019t want that and so they got rid of the Muslim Brotherhood in fairly short order. But that\u2019s what happened, and we supported the people supporting Sharia law.\"\n\nCriticizing the conflicting policies of the Obama administration claiming to fight a war on terror while supporting Islamist groups, Stranahan said, \"this is the schizophrenia we have. Hopefully the Trump administration is going to end once and for all.\"\n\nStranahan also said he found of the timing of allegations of Russia \"hacking the elections\" suspicious, coming at the same time and from the same people who have supported the jihadists in Syria and who have connections to Saudi Arabia. Stranahan said:\n\nThe week that Aleppo is falling, and that Assad is winning, what happens? The CIA, who trained these forces, comes out with a secret report about Russia hacking the election. Hillary Clinton\u2014who\u2019s supported by Saudi Arabia\u2014comes out with a press conference. And who among the Republicans jumps in front of this train and says \u2018Yes, we have to have investigations into the Russians?\u2019 John McCain.\n\nIn response to a question from Schilling about the United State's relationship with Saudi Arabia, Stranahan brought up the Kingdom's deep financial ties, saying \"This goes back to the Nixon administration, when American was in the middle of the oil crisis, when people were standing in line to get gasoline. We sent (Treasury Secretary) William Simon over there, and he negotiated a deal.\"\n\nStranahan cited a May, 2016 article in Bloomberg titled The Untold Story Behind Saudi Arabia's 41-Year U.S. Debt Secret\u00a0that gave details for the first time about history of the deal.\n\nSimon, better than anyone else, understood the appeal of U.S. government debt and how to sell the Saudis on the idea that America was the safest place to park their petrodollars. With that knowledge, the administration hatched an unprecedented do-or-die plan that would come to influence just about every aspect of U.S.-Saudi relations over the next four decades.\n\nThe holdings in treasuries created by that decades-old deal are significant. As the Bloomberg article said:\n\nIn response to a Freedom-of-Information-Act request submitted by Bloomberg News, the Treasury broke out Saudi Arabia's holdings for the first time this month after \"concluding that it was consistent with transparency and the law to disclose the data,\" according to spokeswoman Whitney Smith. The $117 billion trove makes the kingdom one of America's largest foreign creditors.\nYet in many ways, the information has raised more questions than it has answered.

After the robbers killed a guard and made off with $1.6 million, an armed Clark crashed a vehicle carrying several conspirators and $800,000 in nearby Nyack, New York, where two policemen lost their lives in an impromptu ambush as the radical robbers burst out of the back of a UHaul.\n\nAfter the shootout in Nyack, FBI special agent Donald Wofford entered the apartment of the common-law wife of the Black Liberation Army's Sekou Odinga to discover the blood of Clark's May 19 colleague Marilyn Buck, who errantly wounded herself in the shootout, all over the floor\u2014and a cache of documents familiar to him.\n\n\"We found five, five-drawer file cabinets,\" Wofford tells Breitbart News. \"It's Judy Clark's information that she was entitled to due to her suit against the government, and it's five, five-drawer file cabinets she got from the suit. 'What are we gonna do with this?' an agent asked me. 'I'll tell you what we're gonna do. We're gonna rent a UHaul truck and get this the hell out of here. She thinks she got it from the FBI. We just got it back.' It was all the FBI files on the Weather Underground, Judy Clark, Prairie Fire, May 19, Assata Shakur, and all that stuff.\"\n\nIn effect, the suit enabled Clark to compile better intelligence on the FBI than the FBI had gathered on her. Wofford characterized some of the material extracted from the apartment as \"sensitive.\"\n\nWhile one law-enforcement official likened Clark's behavior once caught to Linda Blair in The Exorcist, Wofford compared her movements as a free woman to Fernando Rey in The French Connection. Wigs, aliases, and evasive maneuvers all became part of the repertoire of Clark, who, like the other women of May 19, exhibited effective countersurveillance, according to their FBI watchers.\n\nThe most effective tactic to lose their FBI trailers may have been Clark v. the United States, which stemmed from 1978's federal indictments against former FBI director L. Patrick Gray, former deputy director Mark Felt of \"Deep Throat\" fame, and Edward Miller, head of the bureau's domestic intelligence division. Prosecutors noted three surreptitious entries into Judith Clark's apartment in the early 1970s by the bureau. Her co-defendants experienced, unbeknownst to them, black-bag jobs aimed at securing information about Weatherman fugitives. The government secured convictions of its former servants Felt and Miller, both subsequently pardoned by President Reagan, as a result of the case, and Jimmy Carter's administration relieved J. Wallace LaPrade of his duties as chief of the FBI's New York office.\n\nThe Carter Justice Department targeting its own employees followed 1972's Plamondon case, in which the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed warrantless surveillance evidence on members of the White Panther Party despite one of the defendants dynamiting a CIA office in Ann Arbor, and 1975's Church Committee investigation, which put all intelligence-gathering agencies under a microscope. \"The way the legal system was at that point in time was out of balance,\" Kallstrom opines. \"It was out of balance with common sense.\"\n\nA judge deciding various disputed points in Clark's case opined, \"This suit is a residue of the resistance to the Vietnam war.\" Launched several years after that conflict's end, the civil suit more precisely served as a salvo in another war, one, however far-fetched, declared against the United States by Clark and her comrades. Though several of the litigants came to the bureau's notice not through illegalities but from their blood relations with fugitives, Clark, who later declared herself a prisoner of war when captured after the Brink's robbery, used the suit to not merely embarrass her FBI watchers but to limit their ability to watch.\n\nThe heat, once on the domestic terrorists, reoriented toward law enforcement.\n\nBut when news came of Clark's arrest in connection with the Nanuet Brink's job, even the New York Times noted the egg-coated faces. \"There is an element of vindication in all this for Mr. [Kenneth] Walton and other agents, who remember a time when, as the F.B.I. looked into the increasingly violent activities of some radical groups, it didn't always have the public's support,\" Myron Farber reported in 1982.\n\nNevertheless, Clark's 1978 civil suit resulted in five-figure payments to several of her co-plaintiffs, including one participant in the fatal Nanuet Brink's robbery who, according to the New York Times, used the money for bail. Clark, facing murder charges behind bars at the time of the settlement, reportedly received no money.\n\nBut she received something more valuable from the government\u2014cover\u2014in the years leading up to the fatal robbery in Nanuet. With one participant alleging her participation in an earlier deadly Brink's robbery in the Bronx and a prison break in New Jersey, and former FBI agents wondering about her possible participation in other unsolved violent crimes, Clark, despite prison volunteerism, public apologies, and senior-citizen status, does not strike her former adversaries in the bureau as an ideal candidate for release. Her dishonest abuse of the legal system, they believe, empowered her to commit crimes as it handicapped the FBI. They fear her latest legal gambit marks another act of bad faith.\n\n\"My remembrance is, yeah, it had an impact,\" Kallstrom tells Breitbart News about Clark's and other legal actions from the 1970s. \"I think, without question. It was shocking to guys like me out there protecting people from getting killed by these lunatics. It was a time when the morale of the agency took a hit.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.40540552139282, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1167, "FairnessVirtue": 3, "HarmVice": 11, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 9, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 9, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 4.02266307088, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 1, "PurityVirute": 2, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 55, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170123140000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 4.712939160239929, "mft_mean": 5.0}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/01/23/islamic-state-recruit-trial-key-west/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [280, 293, 1129, 1904, 3005, 3034, 3825, 3838]}}, "headline": "Florida: Jury Told Not to Consider Some Facebook Posts in Islamic State Supporter Trial", "wordcount_as_scraped": 732, "date": "20170124020000", "story_content": "A rather odd trial is now underway in Key West for a rather odd defendant, 25-year-old Harlem Suarez, who stands accused of planning to bomb police officers on behalf of the Islamic State.\n\nThe\u00a0Miami Herald\u00a0lays out some of the curious conditions imposed on prosecutors and jurors:\n\nA Florida Keys jury won't learn Harlem Suarez legally bought an AK-47 rifle during the same time period the government says the Stock Island man plotted to bomb a local beach.\nJurors also cannot view certain photos from his Facebook page that his lawyers would describe in court documents only as \"highly graphic in nature,\" and prosecutors must take care not to argue Suarez is a terrorist or a member of a terrorist organization.\n\nSuarez\u2019s Facebook activities included \u201cextremist rhetoric about recruiting for ISIL,\u201d which prompted a report to the FBI in April 2015. \u201cBe a warrior, learn how to cut your enemies head and then burn down the body learn how to be the new future of the world Caliphate,\u201d he said in one Facebook post, repeated as written by the\u00a0Herald.\n\nHe ran two Facebook pages, one of them under the alias \u201cAlmlak Benitez,\u201d but even the page under his own name listed \u201cjihadist\u201d and \u201cextraordinary prayer for ISIS\u201d under his \u201cLikes.\u201d\n\nEven with the handicaps imposed on prosecutors, their case against Suarez looks strong. He was caught in an FBI sting operation after attempting to purchase grenades and bomb-making materials from an undercover informant.\n\nHe was recorded telling the informant, \u201cI\u2019m gonna do the backpack, that\u2019s for sure, I\u2019m gonna do the backpack\u201d \u2014 a reference to the bomb he intended to create. The bomb would have been packed with nails to inflict maximum carnage. He had already purchased the nails at the time of his arrest.\n\nProsecutors say his objective was to rig bombs under police cars\u00a0or kill police officers with a car bomb attack. He also talked about staging attacks on beaches in Key West, Marathon, or Miami during the Fourth of July holiday.\n\nAnother undercover video has Suarez declaring that \u201cMuslim brothers\u201d should buy \u201cAKs, knives, and machetes\u201d and prepare to fight.\n\nHe said the same thing in one of his Facebook posts: \u201cStand up with us my brother. Stand up with the black flag and the AK with 10 mag, fight with us, be a gangster with us, kill our enemies and convert to Islam now in USA.\u201d\n\nSuarez has proven to be quite a headache for his legal defense team, which has twice asked for permission to withdraw from his case. He once wrote to the judge and asked for all the charges against him to be dropped because his record showed that he was a \u201cresponsible gun owner.\u201d (In fact, he legally purchased an AK-47 rifle before his arrest, but he never picked it up, because he did not fill out the paperwork correctly. That is one of the details the magistrate instructed the jury not to consider.)\n\nNot surprisingly, his counsel has attempted the insanity defense. As the\u00a0Broward-Palm Beach New Times\u00a0reported in November 2015, they were able to marshal some evidence to support the claim: his friends and family have said he believes in vampires, zombies, Bigfoot, mermaids, and the Smurfs. He has repeatedly been described as having the mind of an 11- or 12-year-old. His defenders accuse the FBI of taking advantage of a man with serious mental problems.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve observed is a young man who is very immature for his age, has a very low intellect, and I think that that plays into what happened to him,\u201d defense attorney Richard Della Fera said after a court appearance in August 2015.\n\nAt Suarez\u2019s trial Monday, Della Fera declared, \u201cThere\u2019s no action, it\u2019s just talk. Harlem Suarez is not even a practicing Muslim and knows very little, if anything, about the Islamic religion.\u201d\n\nThe\u00a0Miami Herald\u00a0reports Della Fera \u201cstood up to say his client was goaded, intimidated, and directed into trying to buy explosives from a paid FBI informant.\u201d\n\nSeveral undercover informants testified on the first day of the trial, including one who quoted Suarez saying, \u201cEveryone against us must die. We are ISIS Muslims. One day I will cook Americans.\u201d\n\nCBS News reports the trial is expected to last about two weeks, and Suarez could face life in prison if convicted.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.8139533996582005, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 716, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 6, "LEGISLATION": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 4, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 3, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.29788311768, "HarmVirtue": 3, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 3, "mft_max": 11, "mft_sum": 31, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170124020000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.32960893854749, "mft_mean": 2.8181818181800002}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/12/05/wives-venezuela-political-prisoners-chain-vatican/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e1": [728], "\u00a0": [363, 771, 960, 1039, 1788, 1842], "\u00f3": [375, 454, 1914, 2368]}}, "headline": "Wives of Venezuela\u2019s Political Prisoners Chain Selves Outside Vatican", "wordcount_as_scraped": 523, "date": "20161206040000", "story_content": "The wives and mother of two political prisoners in Venezuela have chained themselves to the gates of the Vatican to demand Pope Francis intervene for the swift liberation of their loved ones, the former mayor of Caracas and the head of one of its largest opposition parties.\n\nLilian Tintori and\u00a0Antonieta L\u00f3pez \u2014 the wife and mother, respectively, of opposition party leader Leopoldo L\u00f3pez \u2014 and Mitzy Capriles, the wife of former Caracas mayor Antonio Ledezma, have chained themselves to the Vatican as a form of peaceful protest for Pope Francis\u2019s intervention in the crisis currently engulfing the Latin American nation.\n\n\n\nDespite socialist dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro canceling a meeting with the Pope\u00a0in 2015, Pope Francis met Maduro at the Vatican in late October, welcoming him to the Holy See and offering \u201cto take any step that would contribute to resolving open questions and generate\u00a0greater trust between the parties.\u201d\n\nThe Vatican now has an active role in the\u00a0dialogue between the socialist government and the opposition in the legislature, though the Maduro government has prevented talks from advancing.

In actuality, the Palestinians never had a state in either the West Bank or eastern Jerusalem and they are not legally recognized as the undisputed authority in those areas.\n\nJordan occupied and annexed the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem from 1948 until Israel captured the lands in a defensive war in 1967 after Arab countries used the territories to launch attacks against the Jewish state. \u00a0In 1988 Jordan officially renounced its claims to the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem.\n\nThe text of the resolution declares that the Israeli settlement enterprise has \"no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace.\"\n\nIt calls for Israel to \"immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem.\"\n\nAs the Committee for Accuracy for Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA) pointed out in an email blast, international law does not make Israeli settlements illegal.\n\nCAMERA notes:\n\nArticle 49 of the Fourth Geneva Conventions, which is relied upon by those who claim the settlements are illegal, does not apply in the case of the West Bank. This is because the West Bank was never under self-rule by a nation that was a party to the Convention, and therefore there is no \"partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party,\" as Article 2 of the Convention specifies. Moreover, even if it did apply, by its plain terms, it applies only to forcible transfers and not to voluntary movement. Therefore, it can't prohibit Jews from choosing to move to areas of great historical and religious significance to them.\n\nThe resolution contradicts a Bush administration commitment to allowing some existing Jewish settlements to remain under a future Israeli-Palestinian deal.\n\nThat U.S. commitment, which the Obama administration has repeatedly violated by condemning settlement activity, was reportedly a key element in Israel's decision to unilaterally evacuate the Gaza Strip in 2005.\n\nThe UN draft resolution text states that \"cessation of all Israeli settlement activities is essential for salvaging the two-State solution,\" and it \"calls for affirmative steps to be taken immediately to reverse the negative trends on the ground that are imperiling the two-State solution.\"\n\nIn 2004, just prior to the Gaza evacuation, President Bush issued a declarative letter stating that it is unrealistic to expect that Israel will not retain some Jewish settlements in a final-status deal with the Palestinians.\n\nThe letter stated:\n\nIn light of new realities on the ground, including already existing major Israeli populations centers, it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949, and all previous efforts to negotiate a two-state solution have reached the same conclusion. It is realistic to expect that any final status agreement will only be achieved on the basis of mutually agreed changes that reflect these realities.\n\nElliott Abrams, the Deputy National Security Adviser for Global Democracy Strategy during Bush's second term, was instrumental in brokering understandings between the U.S. and Israel on settlements. In a June 2009 piece published by the Wall Street Journal, Abrams accused the Obama administration of \"abandoning\" those U.S.-Israel understandings by taking positions critical of all settlement activity.\n\nAbrams wrote:\n\nThere were indeed agreements between Israel and the United States regarding the growth of Israeli settlements on the West Bank \u2026 principles that would permit some continuing growth. \u2026 They emerged from discussions with American officials and were discussed by Messrs.

This has apparently now dawned on Congress as it seeks to amend JASTA.\n\nThe last classified pages of the 9/11 report released earlier this year appeared to indicate that Saudi Arabian government officials had a hand in aiding those plotting the attack. Congress thus sought to hold their government accountable by\u00a0passing\u00a0JASTA. It did so over the objections of senior U.S. government officials and President Barack Obama's veto (which Congress\u00a0overrode\u00a0overwhelmingly).\n\nWhat Congress missed in JASTA's wording was to target a\u00a0real culprit behind the 9/11 attacks \u2014 the government of Iran that sanctioned them, following the demands of that\u00a0nation\u2019s constitution. To do so now means modifying JASTA accordingly.\n\nJASTA's wording neglected a most important\u00a0distinction between rogue government officials working\u00a0individually\u00a0as part of a terrorist effort and government officials\u00a0sanctioned by their government\u00a0to do so. This is the all-important distinction concerning involvement by Iranian versus Saudi government officials.\n\nUnlike the Saudi officials, Iranian conspirators were obeying the nation\u2019s 1979 constitution in aiding terrorist activities. Iran\u2019s constitution contains a\u00a0unique mandate in which Tehran explicitly claims\u00a0extraterritorial jurisdiction\u00a0to spread its Islamic Revolution throughout the world. No other member of the international community makes such an outrageous, overreaching claim of extraterritoriality to impose its laws on other nations.\n\nThe U.S. Congress should restrict JASTA's application only to states claiming this jurisdictional exercise of authority\u2014one refuted by the rest of the global community. Not doing so may allow a wave of frivolous lawsuits against the United States itself, potentially endangering national security operations on the ground.\n\nInternational law\u00a0has long recognized sovereign immunity \u2014 i.e., one nation cannot be sued in the courts of another absent the former's consent. This right\u00a0extends\u00a0\"to\u00a0the person and property of foreign governments themselves.\"\n\nWhile JASTA would open the door to suing a foreign country in the U.S., that door can swing both ways, allowing a foreign country to sue the U.S. in our own courts as well.\n\nFor example, Iraqi Sheikh Jamal Al-Dhari wrote he sees JASTA as \"constituting\u00a0a window of opportunity for millions of Iraqis who have lost their sons and daughters in military operations by U.S. military forces and by U.S. contracted forces since the U.S. invasion in 2003 to pursue compensation from the U.S. government for what they have endured\u2026\u00a0With the passage of JASTA, we intend to hold the United States accountable for unleashing this situation.\"\n\nForeign nations often claim U.S. drone missile strikes kill innocent victims. They will use JASTA as a means of pursuing such claims, resulting in lengthy litigation to prove whether victims truly were innocent.\n\nForeign governments that decide to retaliate against the United States over this law will not deem themselves limited to action commensurate with our legislation.\u00a0As one critic observes about JASTA, it disrupts\u00a0maintenance\u00a0of \"a prudent defense of basic international-relations protocols\u2026\u00a0Once the principle of sovereign immunity is breached, all bets are off.\"\n\nSimilarly, JASTA will open the floodgates for Americans who disagree with presidential actions involving U.S. military forces or assets to file lawsuits claiming the U.S. government is guilty of terrorist activity. While such claims of war crimes\u00a0against\u00a0the administration of George W. Bush were filed pre-JASTA, many more against the U.S. can be expected post-JASTA.\n\nShould Congress allow itself to be motivated by emotion regarding the 9/11 families rather than the logic that dictates JASTA not be implemented as is, a potential mid-ground position is available to recognize this, keeping the international standard intact and isolating liability to an egregious terrorist nation such as Iran.\n\nEven if the released 9/11 pages support evidence some rogue Saudi officials may have been involved, there is no evidence of official Saudi government complicity as is the case with Iran, nor does obeying Saudi law require officials, as in Iran, to participate in such illicit activities. Accordingly, Tehran should be JASTA's real target. Doing so, either via the proposed amendment or the extraterritorial hook, eliminates the Pandora's box paradox.\n\nLt. Colonel James G.

Pipeline opponents say the spill is proof pipelines cannot be operated safely, but the truth is pipelines are much safer than many other human activities, including \"safe sex.\"\n\nWhenever tens of thousands of gallons of oil are spilled, it sounds to most people like a disaster of epic proportions, but numbers don't mean anything unless they are put in their proper context.\n\nNews outlets and environmental groups often talk about oil spills in terms of gallons spilled because it sounds far scarier than other units of measurement, but oil, for all intents and purposes, is measured in barrels. There are 42 gallons in each barrel of oil, which means approximately 4,200 barrels of oil were spilled. More than 4,000 barrels of oil is a significant amount quantity; you wouldn't want someone to dump this oil on your front lawn. But acting as if this spill proves DAPL cannot operate safely is nonsense, especially when placed in the context of how much oil is moved by pipelines every single day.\n\nAmericans consume approximately 19.4 million barrels of oil daily\u2014or, if we want to be dramatic, 814 million gallons. Data provided by the Association of Oil Pipelines (AOP) estimates 9.3 billion barrels of crude oil were transported by pipelines in the United States in 2014, amounting to nearly 25 million barrels per day. (The difference between the number of barrels of oil consumed by Americans and the number transported by pipelines is likely the result of AOP's figures including both imported and exported oil transported via a pipeline.)\n\nAccording to data from the Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), since 2010 there have been 1,300 pipeline spills, leaking a total of approximately 212,000 barrels of oil. This amounts to an annual average of 216 total spills leaking approximately 35,317 barrels of oil per year. This means more than 99.9 percent of all the crude transported via pipeline in 2015 is estimated to have safely reached its destination.\n\nFurthermore, when spills did occur, the vast majority of the oil spilled was successfully recovered during cleanup. PHMSA reported 150,000 barrels, over 70 percent of the 212,000 barrels spilled, have been recovered since 2010 (not including the most recent spills). This brings the average amount spilled to approximately 10,333 barrels per year.\n\nIf oil is not shipped via pipeline, it will be shipped by rail, which has its own potential for spills. In 2013, more than 1.15 million gallons of crude oil were spilled while being transported by railcars, which is about 39-railcar's worth of crude. Despite the uptick in railcar accidents in 2013, 99.99 percent of shipments of oil made by rail arrived without incident.\n\nWhether transported by pipeline or by rail, a barrel of crude oil or petroleum products reaches its destination safely over 99.999 percent of the time. By contrast, the effectiveness of condoms is 98 percent, meaning transporting oil through pipelines is safer than having safe sex.\n\nPipeline opponents like to pretend that if they protest pipelines and fight efforts to ship crude by rail, Americans will somehow, perhaps magically, no longer rely on oil as their primary source of energy. This sort of \"No Drill, No Spill\" attitude exemplified by the so-called \"Keep It in the Ground\" movement is equivalent to an abstinence-only energy policy, and it is utterly unrealistic.\n\nWhen 9.3 billion gallons of oil are transported via pipeline every year, the unfortunate fact of the matter is there will be spills. The key is not to ban pipelines, but to constantly work to improve pipeline technology, to reduce the number of spills and the amount spilled, and to immediately work to clean up spills when they happen, to minimize their impact on the environment.\u00a0\n\nPresident Barack Obama made an irresponsible, politically motivated decision when he instructed the Army Corps of Engineers to deny a crucial easement needed to complete the construction of the 1,172-mile pipeline. Hopefully, President-elect Donald Trump will act responsibly by righting this wrong.\n\nIsaac Orr (IOrr@heartland.org) is a research fellow specializing in hydraulic fracturing at The Heartland Institute.

Government and allied troops, including Lebanese, Iraqi and Iranian fighters, have concentrated their fight on the northeastern part of the enclave, swiftly taking new districts since their offensive began last week. Another front on the southern outskirts of the city has been slower, as rebel fighters push back government advances there.\n\nThe advances have caused massive displacement. The UN estimated that more than 31,000 have already fled their homes, either to government or Kurdish areas, or deeper into the besieged enclave. The fighting has also intensified the rebel shelling of government-held areas in Aleppo.\n\nThe state broadcaster al-Ikhbariya said \"precise operations\" by government and allied troops aim to rout out \"terrorists,\" which is how the government refers to all armed opposition groups.\n\nThe sound of war prevailed in the city early Saturday. Warplanes made several runs overhead, drawing what appeared to be rebel machine gun fire toward the aircraft.\n\nThe Russian Interfax news agency report quoted an unnamed Syrian military official as saying that a light ground attack aircraft, L-39 jet, was shot down near Aleppo, and its crew was killed.\n\nThe opposition Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of activists on the ground, said two pilots were killed when rebel fighters targeted the aircraft as it approached Aleppo airport to the east of the city.\n\nAsked about reports of the downed plane, Syrian army spokesman Brig. Gen. Samir Suleiman said \"we have no such information about such an incident and when such things happen the army announces them.\" He was speaking to reporters in Aleppo.\n\nSuleiman said the Syrian army has regained control of 45-to-50 percent of east Aleppo, and accused insurgents of hiding among civilians.\n\nSyria's Defense Minister and other senior officers visited newly captured areas in Aleppo on Saturday, according to state-run media.\n\nThe Syrian Civil Defense in eastern Aleppo said six people were killed in bombings of the central al-Shaar neighborhood. Opposition news agency Thiqa also put the death toll at six. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll at three, adding it was likely to rise. In government-held Aleppo, rebel shelling killed five people, according to the state news agency SANA.\n\nTo the south of the city, government cannons could be heard firing toward rebel-held areas.\n\nResidents in eastern Aleppo also reported intense shelling in al-Sukkari neighborhood on the southern edge of the enclave, where many of the newly displaced have sought refuge.\n\n\"The noose is tightening quickly,\" said Mohammed Abu Jaafar, a medical official in besieged eastern Aleppo. \"Our resources are also running low and beginning to disappear.\"\n\nThe bombings Saturday came hours after government troops made new advances on eastern parts of the enclave, including in Tariq al-Bab and al-Khaterji districts.\n\nState media reported that government and allied troops have moved in on new neighborhoods, pushing one kilometer (0.6 mile) deeper into the enclave from the far east.\n\nThe new advances tighten the government's grip on the enclave and reduce the territory the rebels hold by more than half, according to the Observatory.\n\nThe new advances also secure the airport road east of Aleppo, leading to the city's international airport and a military airbase. The pan-Arab Mayadeen TV station said intense bombing in eastern Aleppo was designed to ensure rebels have been cleared from the airport road.\n\nMoscow, a main backer of the Syrian government, says its warplanes haven't bombed Aleppo since Oct. 18. But the Russian military has helped fend off rebel attempts to break the siege of the city.\n\n\"We and the Russians are allies and everything that is happening is coordinated between Russian and Syrian leadership,\" said Syrian army spokesman Suleiman.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow is ready to hold quick talks with the US \"to ensure the withdrawal of all rebels without exception from eastern Aleppo, ensure humanitarian supplies to the city residents and the restoration of normal life in eastern Aleppo.\"\n\nLavrov and US Secretary of State John Kerry will meet in Geneva early next week. After their meeting in Rome Friday, Lavrov said Kerry gave him Washington's proposals for settling the situation in Aleppo, which he described as conforming to Russia's longtime offers.

The number represents an increase of more than 230 percent over the same period in FY 2016.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection officials reported 149 Border Patrol agents were assaulted in October and November. During that same period in 2015, 45 agents were assaulted. This represents an increase of 104 assaults in the two-months compared (231 percent), CBP officials reported on Monday. The numbers of CBP law enforcement agents and officers has been increasing for the past three years.\n\nBorder Patrol Chief Mark Morgan first revealed these numbers during testimony before the U.S. Senate Homeland Security Committee in November, Breitbart News reported. Acknowledging the more that 200 percent increase in assaults on agents this year, Morgan testified that Border Patrol agents are \"the most assaulted federal law enforcement (agents) in the United States. More than 7,400 Border Patrol agents have been assaulted since 2006. That rose in FY 16 by 20%, and year-to-date, we're seeing an increase of assaults of 200% from the previous year-to-date. It's a dangerous job.\"\n\nThe increase of assaults comes during a period where CBP officials have been pushing for a reduction in the use of force by Border Patrol agents. The use of force statistics are broken down into three categories in the CBP report. Those categories are: Firearm, Less-Lethal Device, and Other. The use of force by agents for the first two months of this fiscal year are down in all three categories. Use of force by Border Patrol agents decreased by nearly 13 percent during this period. At the same time, assaults on agents increased by more than 200 percent.\n\nLast week, a Border Patrol agent in Arizona was forced to use his sidearm to defend himself after an illegal alien reportedly assaulted him with the agent's collapsible steel baton. The illegal alien obtained control of the weapon during a struggle where he was attempting to escape from being arrested, CBP officials stated. The agent was not injured in the assault. The suspected illegal alien was wounded in the leg and taken to a Tucson hospital where he was treated for a \"non-life threatening wound.\"\n\nShortly before that, Border Patrol agents working on the Rio Grande River in Texas on Thanksgiving Day were assaulted by Mexican nationals throwing rocks at the agents from the Mexican side of the river. Fortunately, none of the agents were injured in the attack. The Mexican nationals quickly fled the scene.\n\nThat same week, a Border Patrol agent assigned to the Rio Grande Valley Sector and a Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) trooper were shot by someone from the Mexican side of the border. The shooting likely occurred during a gun battle in Mexico. It is not definitively known if the American law enforcement officers were targeted or struck by stray bullets. The agent was shot in the chest, but his protective armor saved his life. The trooper was struck in the leg and was transported to a local hospital for treatment. He was expected to fully recover from his wound.\n\nThe largest numbers of assaults on agents comes in the Rio Grande Valley Sector in Texas and the El Centro Sector in southern California. During the first month of the new fiscal year, eight assaults of Border Patrol agents occurred in the El Centro station. On October 30, an agent was injured when he was struck in the eye by an illegal alien using his elbow as a weapon. Other agents in that sector have been struck by rocks and concrete blocks as well.\n\n\"We will not tolerate assaults on our agents by criminals, and will vigorously pursue Assault on a Federal Officer prosecution against anyone who perpetrates such violence,\" Assistant Chief Patrol Agent David S. Kim said in a written statement at the time.\n\nBorder Patrol agents have told Breitbart Texas this is not necessarily true. Agents have said that unless an agent is severely injured, charges of assaulting the federal agent are often not prosecuted.\n\nEven when prosecuted and convicted, sentences handed down on these cases tends to be less severe than similar assaults on other law enforcement officers. Breitbart Texas\u00a0reported\u00a0in June about two Salvadoran illegal immigrants who were sentenced to 27 months and 63 months in prison for assaulting a Border Patrol agent in Texas.\n\nBorder Patrol agents are frequently\u00a0assaulted by rock throwers\u00a0from Mexico, Breitbart Texas Managing Director and Editor-in-Chief Brandon Darby reported in April 2014. Many of these assaults lead to serious injury or even death for the agents. \"The reality being far from the false narrative of 'kids throwing pebbles,'\" Darby reported, \"the life-threatening rock attacks against Border Patrol agents often occur in remote areas when a solitary Border Patrol agent may be up to a 90-minute drive from their nearest backup.\" The article reveals photographic proof of many of the injuries received by agents during these assaults and the size of the \u201crocks\u201d used in the assaults.\n\nThe majority of assaults on CBP law enforcement officers and agents are carried out against Border Patrol agents. The total assaults against CBP officers and agents rose from 373 in FY 2014, to 477 in in FY 2015 and again in FY 2016 to 585.

In June 2015, for example, a poll showed that 56 percent of Americans want to exclude migrants who believe in Islam's sharia law, which requires that democracy and civic\u00a0norms by subordinated the Islamic scriptures. In contrast, only about 20 percent of Americans told the pollster that they did not oppose the immigration of people who believe in sharia law.\n\nTrump's support for American culture is the centerpiece of his Friday order on immigration, but the policy\u2019s importance has been overlooked by the TV-magnified protests. \n\nTrump's American-first declaration is a huge reform because it directly rejects the claim by globalist progressives \u2014 including former President Barack Obama \u2014 that foreign people have the same rights as Americans, including the right to live in the United States, regardless of who Americans prefer to invite into their home.\n\nHere's the critical passage from Trump's Friday order: \n\n\nIn order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles. The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law. In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including \"honor\" killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation.\n\n\nObama described the prior globalist policy in a Nov. 2014 speech to Democratic supporters in Chicago:\n\n\nSometimes we get attached to our particular tribe, our particular race, our particular religion, and then we start treating other folks differently. And that, sometimes, has been a bottleneck to how we think about immigration.\u00a0 If you look at the history of immigration in this country, each successive wave, there have been periods where the folks who were already here suddenly say, 'Well, I don't want those folks' \u2014 even though the only people who have the right to say that are some Native Americans.\n\n\nObama made the same diversity-first claim in September 2015: \n\n\nWhen I hear folks talking as if somehow these [foreign] kids are different than my kids or less worthy in the eyes of God, that somehow that they are less worthy of our respect and consideration and care, I think that's un-American. I don't believe that, I think it is wrong and I think we should do better, because that's how America was made.\n\n\nObama's outside policy is expressed more crudely by the alliance of Islamic and left-wing groups which is now protesting Trump's pro-America immigration policy at airports.\n\n#SFO: \"No borders, no nations, fuck deportations\" pic.twitter.com/pyIADfsr0x\n\u2014 Dieter Bohn (@backlon) January 29, 2017\n\n\n\nOn Sunday evening, a senior administration official briefed reporters on Trump's American-first migration policy.\n\n\"The reality, though, is that the situation [of large Islamic populations] that exists today in parts of France, in parts of Germany, in Belgium, etcetera, is not a situation we want replicated inside the United States,\" the official said. \n\n\nThe kind of large and permanent domestic terror threat that becomes multi-dimensional and multi-generational and becomes sort of a permanent feature, in case this, becomes a permanent feature of American life. We don't want a situation where, 20 to 30 years from now, it's just like a given thing that on a fairly regular basis there is domestic terror strikes, stores are shut up or that airports have explosive devices planted, or people are mowed down in the street by cars and automobiles and things of that nature\u2026\nThe United States is sovereign country. It is under no obligation to admit any particular person and we have a right to develop a system in which we're selecting immigrants that we think will be able to make positive contributions to U.S. society.\n\n\nThis pro-American policy is a huge threat to many advocacy groups, such as the orthodox Islamist groups now pushing to increase the inflow of Muslims into Americans society, the Latino advocacy groups who want more Latino voters, and the elitist Democratic Party, which expects to win national power by collecting votes from diverse immigrant voters.\n\nBut Trump's huge shift to pro-American immigration policy was welcomed by opponents of political Islam, including best-selling author Robert Spencer, an expert on Islam.\u00a0The new policy, he wrote: \n\n\nindicates that they know exactly what they're doing. This isn't something they put together in a week; this is evidence of their entire thinking on Islam and the defence of the west. They're going to treat Islam as a hostile political ideology. That is what has been needed for decades. It is the reversal of the \"Islam is a religion of peace\" doctrine set in place by Bush on September 17, 2001.\n\n\nMany polls show that majorities of Americans are skeptical of immigrants' impact on American society, worry about imported jihad terrorism, oppose any increase above the current level of million immigrants per year \u2014 that is roughly\u00a0one new immigrant for every four American births\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and also oppose the continued inflow of cheap labor and unskilled refugees.\n\nFor example, a September 2015 poll by Ipsos showed that:\n\n\nonly 22 percent of Ipsos' respondents want the United States to accept 10,000 or more migrants [per year]. That number includes 10 percent who want the country to accept 500,000 or more migrants.\u00a0Another 26 percent of Americans said they would accept up to 10,000 refugees. The survey did not say that the country already accepts 70,000 refugees per year.\u00a0Twenty-four percent said they want no additional refugees above the 1,500, and 29 percent declined to answer the poll, indicating quiet opposition to greater inflows.\n\n\nAn August 2016 poll of 2,061 adults showed that:\u00a0\n\n\nthree in ten Americans overall (36%) support taking in refugees from Syria. A majority of Democrats (56%) support admitting Syrian refugees; in contrast only minorities of Republicans (18%) and Independents (32%) agree.\n\n\nThese skeptical attitudes however, are balanced with Americans' decent emotional welcome for most individual immigrants, and with their gratitude for the nation's generous history of immigration and support for constitutional rights.\u00a0A December 2015 \u00a0poll of 1,140 registered voters by Quinnipiac showed that:\n\n\nmost voters said Syrian refugees should not be allowed to come to the U.S., [but] most voters opposed banning all Muslims from coming to the U.S., with 66 percent of voters opposing the idea and 27 percent supporting a ban. A majority of Republicans, however, 51 \u2013 41 percent, approved of a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. Democrats largely opposed a ban, 79-18 percent, as did independent voters, 67-22 percent.\n\n\nSo the polling data suggests that Americans want their freedoms shared with Muslims now living in the United States \u2014 but they don\u2019t want more Muslims to come live in the United States.\n\nA February 2016 poll of Republicans in South Carolina showed that:\n\n\nWhen the poll asked \"Would you support or oppose banning Muslims from entering the United States?\" 60 percent of the state's GOP voters said they would support a ban.\u00a0But only 29 percent of respondents said they would \"support \u2026 shutting down mosques\" in the United States, and only 25 percent said the disliked Islamic doctrines [of sharia] should be illegal.\n\n\nIn June 2016, a\u00a0poll of 803 registered voters was conducted by OpinionSavvy, via telephone, using automated questions, and with a margin of error at 3.5 percent.\n\nFirst, the poll asked whether tourists and immigrants should be screened to check for their possible support of Islamic sharia. Seventy percent of respondents approved of the screening.\u00a0The poll then asked the 70 percent; \"Do you believe that individuals who support the practice of [Islamic] Sharia law should be admitted into the United States?\"\u00a0 No, responded four-fifths of the 70 percent. That translates into 56 percent of total respondents preferring to exclude additional sharia-supporting Muslims.\u00a0The overall opposition to the exclusion of sharia supporters added up to just 20 percent, with the rest undecided.\n\nThe push and pull of these rival emotions, however, is overwhelmingly subordinated to Americans' lopsided desire that companies hire Americans first before importing more foreign immigrations or foreign contract workers. Polls shows that roughly 80 percent of Americans say companies should hire of young Americans before hiring migrants.\n\nA July 2016 poll shows that roughly three out of four voters\u2014 including nearly three out of four Democrat voters\u2014 believe that \"instead of giving jobs and healthcare to millions of refugees from around the world, we should rebuild our inner cities and put Americans back to work.\" The view was shared by almost 90 percent of African-Americans and almost 70 percent of Hispanics.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0In 2016, Trump's focus on jobs for Americans \u2014 instead of additional immigration championed by Hillary Clinton \u2014 helped him win critical majority in the so-called \"Blue Wall\" states of Wisconsin Pennsylvania and Michigan. So now he is implementing the voters\u2019 preferences, amid a growing roar of protest from the elite-led coalition of immigrant and ethnic-minority political activists.\u00a0", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 17, "AuthorityVice": 6, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.5519287586212203, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 1, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1473, "FairnessVirtue": 4, "HarmVice": 2, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 10, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 6, "AFFECT": 1, "mft_stdev": 7.0581996159200004, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 24, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 1, "mft_median": 5, "mft_max": 24, "mft_sum": 77, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 1, "timestamp": 20170130220000, "FairnessVice": 5, "pct_mft_words": 5.22742701968771, "mft_mean": 7.0}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/12/02/many-illegal-aliens-can-vote-immigration-officer/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [867, 1712, 1741, 2002, 3563]}}, "headline": "Former Immigration Officer: Many Illegals Can Vote with Fake Documents", "wordcount_as_scraped": 689, "date": "20161203050000", "story_content": "A former immigration officer says many illegal aliens can vote in national elections, in part because they can easily buy fake identification documents.\n\n\u201cI probably arrested more than a thousand illegal aliens in my career,\u201d retired ICE Special-Agent-In-Charge Claude Arnold said during an interview with Fox News\u2019 Bill O\u2019Reilly. \u201cI routinely encounter people in possession of voter registration cards\u2026 I would ask them, \u2018Do you or have you voted?\u2019 And often, I would get the answer, yes,\u201d he said, adding that about 100 illegals told him that they had voted.\n\nIllegals can vote because they can get realistic fake documents, he said.\n\n\u201cThe demand is so great for counterfeit documents because the illegal alien population wants to work\u2014that\u2019s the majority of their motivation for wanting to come\u00a0to this country,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s a huge demand for those documents that are required to pass the employment eligibility verification procedures,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIn every neighborhood where there\u2019s a significant illegal alien population, there are at least several document vendors who supply this service.\u201d Illegals typically buy fraudulent documents in threes, he continued: A counterfeit resident alien card or work authorization card, plus a counterfeit California driver\u2019s license, and a counterfeit Social Security card, which costs about $120 to $300.\n\nArnold\u2019s interview comes after President-elect Donald Trump declared he would would have won the popular vote if millions who voted illegally were discounted.\n\nDemocratic Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a longtime ally of Hillary Clinton, ignored his state\u2019s supreme court ruling and\u00a0illegally gave 60,000 felons\u00a0voter registration cards. Also, at least eight million adult illegal aliens are residing in the United States in defiance of the law.\n\nThe media did not investigate these claims, automatically declaring them \u201cfalse\u201d with much outrage and finger-wagging. Still,\u00a0voting experts have told reporters at the Daily Mail that it\u2019s likely illegal aliens, non-citizens, and other ineligible people, did vote in significant numbers on Election Day:\n\n[E]xperts warn today that the rapid media condemnation of the president-elect is itself flawed\u2014and that he was at the very least partially right in his claims.\nThey said it is certain that\u2014among other things\u2014non-citizens were registered to vote and [did] cast ballots.\nIt is also certain that there were other instances of illegal voting, including people who vote under false identities, and people who cast ballots in multiple states, which most attacks on Trump\u2019s tweet chose to ignore, they warned\u2026\nThe most recent serious attempt to measure the number of non-citizen voters found that illegal voting is a widespread problem, although not as prevalent as Trump\u2019s comments suggested.\nThe 2013 study was conducted by Jesse Richman, a professor at Old Dominion University.\nThe report was based on surveys by the Cooperative Congressional Election Studies in 2008 and 2010, which asked respondents for citizen status and whether they had voted.\nBased on the data, Richman estimated that 6.4 percent of non-citizens voted in the 2008 presidential election, which would translate to around 1.2 million votes. According to Richman, about 80 percent of these non-citizens voted for Barack Obama against John McCain.\nBut the professor says his findings still wouldn\u2019t account for Hillary Clinton\u2019s entire 2.2 million lead against Trump in the popular vote.\n\nThese problems may have been\u00a0compounded by the outgoing president himself. Days before the election, Obama gave an evasive response in a YouTube interview suggesting to his critics that any voter fraud committed by illegal aliens would not be prosecuted under his administration.\n\nTrue The Vote, an organization dedicated to stopping voter fraud, strongly backed Trump\u2019s claims about illegal voting.\n\n\u201cTrue the Vote absolutely supports President-elect Trump's recent comment about the impact of illegal voting, as reflected in the national popular vote,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cWe are still collecting data and will be for several months, but our intent is to publish a comprehensive study on the significant impact of illegal voting in all of its many forms and begin a national discussion on how voters, states, and the Trump Administration can best address this growing problem.\u201d", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 19, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.6375837326049805, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0,

(AFP)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Uncertainty spread across the Middle East following Donald Trump\u2019s US election win, with questions hanging over the war against the Islamic State group, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Iran\u2019s nuclear deal.\n\nIn some parts of the region the surprise victory was welcomed with calls for Trump to take action, in others it sparked alarm.\n\nBut it was unclear what impact Trump\u2019s isolationist views would have on US engagements in the Middle East, adding another measure of confusion to an already-volatile region.\n\n\u2013 \u2018True friend\u2019 of Israel \u2013\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rushed to congratulate Trump on his win, calling him a \u201ctrue friend\u201d of the Jewish state.\n\n\u201cI look forward to working with him to advance security, stability and peace in our region,\u201d the right-wing premier said in a statement.\n\n\u201cI am confident that president-elect Trump and I will continue to strengthen the unique alliance between our two countries and bring it to ever greater heights.\u201d\n\nIn a meeting with Netanyahu in New York in September, Trump pledged to recognise Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s \u201cundivided\u201d capital if elected, in a break with longstanding US policy.\n\nTrump\u2019s adviser on Israel, David Friedman, also said last month the candidate was \u201ctremendously sceptical\u201d about the prospects for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nIsraeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett, who heads the hardline Jewish Home party, said that with Trump\u2019s election: \u201cThe era of a Palestinian state is over.\u201d\n\nPalestinian reaction to Trump\u2019s win was muted.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to deal with the elected president on the basis of a two-state solution and to establish a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders,\u201d Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas\u2019s spokesman told AFP.\n\nNabil Abu Rudeina said failure to resolve the decades-old conflict would mean \u201cthe unstable situation will continue in the region\u201d.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Nice surprise\u2019 in Damascus \u2013\n\nDuring the campaign Trump repeatedly pledged to \u201cdestroy\u201d the jihadist Islamic State group, but presented no clear plan for how.\n\nA US-led coalition is backing Iraqi forces and a Syrian militia alliance as they battle to drive IS from Mosul and Raqa, its last major strongholds in the two countries.\n\nHow Trump moves forward with the anti-IS offensive will depend on how he intends to deal with traditional US allies in the region, in particular Sunni Arab Gulf states, and his approach to the war in Syria.\n\nWashington has backed rebel forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad in Syria\u2019s five-year civil war, and Hillary Clinton was especially supportive of regime change.\n\nBut Trump has repeatedly voiced admiration for Vladimir Putin and advocated a US rapprochement with Russia \u2014 which along with Iran is one of Assad\u2019s strongest supporters.\n\nTrump said earlier this year that fighting both IS and Assad simultaneously was \u201cmadness, and idiocy\u201d.\n\nWaddah Abed Rabbo, editor-in-chief of pro-regime Syrian daily Al-Watan, said Trump\u2019s win came as a \u201cnice surprise\u201d in Damascus.\n\n\u201cIt is time for the policies of the United States to change and stop being hostage to the catastrophic wishes of the Gulf countries, which have destroyed several countries in the region,\u201d he said.\n\nA Syrian rebel official said opposition forces were actually hoping for more support from Washington.\n\n\u201cThe Americans, by their hesitation, have allowed the regime and its allies to commit barbaric massacres against civilians in Syria,\u201d said Bassam Mustafa of the Nureddin al-Zinki rebel group, one of the more powerful factions in rebel-held areas of Syria\u2019s second city Aleppo.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Not possible\u2019 to change Iran deal \u2013\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s intentions elsewhere in the Middle East may be vague, his stand on last year\u2019s nuclear deal between world powers and Iran was clear \u2014 Trump described it as \u201cdisastrous\u201d and said it would be his \u201cnumber one priority\u201d to dismantle the agreement.\n\nIran\u2019s President Hassan Rouhani, who staked his political reputation on the deal in the face of fierce hardline opposition, said there was no way Trump could rip it up.\n\n\u201cThe accord was not concluded with one country or government but was approved by a resolution of the UN Security Council and there is no possibility that it can be changed by a single government,\u201d Rouhani told his cabinet, according to state television.\n\n\u201cThe United States no longer has the capacity to create Iranophobia and to create a consensus against Iran,\u201d Rouhani said.\n\nForeign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Trump needed to \u201cunderstand the realities of today\u2019s world.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is that the future US president stick to agreements, to engagements undertaken,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 Saudi king urges \u2018stability\u2019 \u2013\n\nWashington\u2019s longstanding allies in the Gulf have bristled under President Barack Obama, who they felt was reluctant to get involved in regional conflicts and did not do enough to check the ambitions of their regional rival Iran.\n\nCongratulating Trump on the win, Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Salman praised \u201chistoric and tight\u201d ties with the United States and wished him success \u201cin your mission to achieve security and stability in the Middle East and worldwide.\u201d\n\nUnited Arab Emirates President Sheikh Kahlifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan also said his country was eager to strengthen \u201cstrategic relations\u201d with Washington.\n\nEgypt\u2019s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said he hoped Trump\u2019s win would inject \u201ca new spirit\u201d into US-Egyptian relations, which have been tense since the army toppled Sisi\u2019s Islamist predecessor Mohamed Morsi in 2013.\n\nSisi said he hoped \u201cto strengthen the ties of cooperation between Egypt and the United States of America on all levels.\u201d\n\nSisi, whose regime has been criticised by the Obama administration over its human rights record, told CNN in September that Trump would \u201cno doubt\u201d be a strong leader.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 3, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.4736841917038, "HarmVice": 5,

Yet while mainstream media figures sound the alarm today, Assad\u2019s human\u00a0rights atrocities are half a decade old. The situation in Aleppo is in part\u00a0the product of President Barack Obama\u2019s failure to lead in preventing Assad from making\u00a0human rights violations a habit.\n\nHad President Obama kept his word to punish Assad should he use chemical weapons on civilians in August 2012,\u00a0no power vacuum would exist for Putin or jihadist elements to exploit in Aleppo. With Assad gone, Syria could have begun its rehabilitation process years before the devastation occurring today.\n\nWith Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at his side,\u00a0this should not have been a new lesson for President Obama. The United States has abrogated its responsibility to the international community before \u2013 under President Bill Clinton, when over one million Rwandans died in a genocide most agree could have been prevented.\n\nThe situation in Aleppo is harrowing. Activists\u00a0on the ground say they are not allowed to leave, and Syrian government soldiers are going door to door killing entire families. The\u00a0New York Times quotes French\u00a0Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault describing the scene as \u201ccoldblooded murders of entire families on the ground who were deemed close to the opposition; summary executions, including of women and children; people burned alive in their homes; the continuation of systematic targeting of hospitals, their staff and their patients.\"\n\nThose with access to the internet in Aleppo are posting their final goodbyes on social media, urging the international community to acknowledge their genocide and intervene, better late than never.\n\nWhen Russia officially entered the Syrian fray, Assad\u2019s forces had been largely diminished, the product of fighting too many foes\u00a0at once: moderate Syrian rebels, Al Qaeda, the Islamic State, the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), among others. Russia vowed to fight ISIS, but almost immediately failed to do so. In October 2015, when Russian officials were still pretending their intervention was in the name of fighting ISIS, four out of every five airstrikes by Russian fighter jets were not hitting Islamic State targets.\n\nWhile Reuters lists a number of jihadist groups \u2013 including Hezbollah, involved in defense of Assad \u2013 as active participants in the battle of Aleppo, the Islamic State is not one of them.\n\nMany Syrian rebels blame President Obama for this tragedy.\u00a0\"History will never forgive Obama for what he has done to the Syrian people\u2026 [Obama] abandoned the Syrian people and gave Bashar the green light,\u201d Syrian rebel leader\u00a0Riad Hijab told the\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0last week. A Syrian government official, in a way confirming that President Obama\u2019s inaction on Syria benefits Damascus, told Reuters last week that \u201cThe Russians want to complete the [Aleppo] operation before Trump takes power.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama has given the Assad regime\u00a0reason to believe they can act with impunity. President Obama\u2019s intervention in Syria consists largely of a failed program to train rebel leaders \u2013 so failed that many of those trained by America left to fight with jihadist groups two years ago \u2013 and a speech vowing consequences for Assad should he used chemical weapons: the famous 2012 \u201cred line\u201d speech.\n\n\"We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus,\" President Obama said then.\n\nIt is unclear how his calculus changed, as Assad continued to use chemical weapons against civilians on multiple occasions after the speech, and has now won the largest battle of the Syrian\u00a0Civil War. Images of civilians suffering gas attack wounds were common a year after the speech. By December 2013, Assad was dropping barrel bombs on civilians in Aleppo. \n\nThis August, reports surfaced of Assad\u00a0dropping chlorine bombs on an Aleppo suburb.\u00a0The world continues to await any response from the Obama administration.\n\nLast week. Russian and Syrian government planes dropped leaflets over Aleppo. \u201cEveryone has given up on you,\u201d they reportedly read\u00a0\u201cyou will be annihilated.\u201d\n\nThe Aleppo massacre is about as new as President Obama\u2019s promise to do something about it.\n\nObama\u2019s inaction on chemical weapons prompted Putin to\u00a0intervene in Syria, putting on a show in which Assad claimed to dispose of the weapons, only to continue to use them years later.\n\nIf the story\u00a0sounds similar, if a bit more Russian than the first time, that\u2019s because this is not the first massacre in recent memory perpetrated while a Democratic White House stood idly by. In January 1994, Canadian Lieutenant General Romeo Dallaire sent a message to his UN overlords in New York, warning that the leaders of the country where he was stationed, Rwanda, \u201cwere going to conduct an outright slaughter and elimination of the opposition,\u201d he recalled years later. \u201cNobody was interested,\u201d he told CNN in 2008.\n\nThe United Nations did little, and the Clinton administration all but ignored reports warning the State Department a \u201cbloodbath\u201d was imminent. State Department documents seemed to contradict Clinton\u2019s claims at the time that his administration could not comprehend how vast the genocide was.\n\nA study\u00a0by an Organization for African Unity panel found that\u00a0no nation did more than the US to undermine the effectiveness of\" the UN in stopping the massacre.\u00a0\"The Americans, led by US Ambassador Madeleine Albright, played the key role in blocking more expeditious action by the UN\u2026\u201d the\u00a0International Panel of Eminent Personalities to Investigate the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda and the Surrounding Events concluded. \u201cAs the carnage continued, the UN dithered in organizing any kind of response to the ongoing tragedy.\u201d\n\nOf course the two situations differ significantly: the Rwandan genocide resulted in between one and two million deaths; Aleppo\u2019s death toll remains unknown, but an estimated 250,000 civilians are under threat. In September, that number was closer to 600,000, according to the United Nations. Those committing the Rwandan genocide were Rwandans, killing their countrymen;\u00a0in Aleppo, Putin has as much blood on his hands as Assad does. Yet the foreign policy principles that triggered a U.S. failure to intervene in Rwanda\u00a0are alive and well in Syria: the blunder of promising to be present before a tragedy occurs and reneging.\n\nYears after leaving office, Clinton himself seemed to agree with his critics on Rwanda. \u201cIf we\u2019d gone in sooner, I believe we could have saved at least a third of the lives that were lost,\u201d he told CNBC at the time. The best the residents of Aleppo can hope for now is a similar statement from President Obama two decades from now, if they survive the carnage.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 11, "AuthorityVice": 5, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -6.32000017166138, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1145, "FairnessVirtue": 2, "HarmVice": 13, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.10804491916, "HarmVirtue": 2, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 1, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 3, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 13, "mft_sum": 42, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161214160000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 3.66812227074236, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 3.8181818181800002}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/01/05/5-jan-17-world-view-israel-polarized-conviction-soldier-manslaughter/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [3109, 3175]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 721, "scraper_regex": 796}}, "headline": "World View: Israel Polarized over Conviction of Soldier for Manslaughter", "wordcount_as_scraped": 796, "date": "20170105150000", "story_content": "This morning\u2019s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com\n\nIsrael polarized over conviction of soldier for manslaughter\n\n\nScreen grab from video of March 4, 2016. Israeli soldier reloads his gun just before shooting dead the Palestinian lying wounded and bleeding (AP)\n\nIsraelis appeared to be deeply polarized in reaction to a verdict handed down by a military court on Wednesday convicting an Israeli soldier, Elor Azaria, of manslaughter, for having shot and killed a Palestinian who was lying on the ground wounded.\n\nOn March 24 of last year Abdel Fattah al-Sharif and Ramzi Qasrawi Tamimi, two 21-year-old Palestinians, stabbed an Israeli soldier in Hebron, a majority Palestinian city in the West Bank. Tamimi was shot and killed immediately.\n\nAl-Sharif was also shot. The shot did not kill him, but left him wounded and bleeding, lying on the ground. Almost 15 minutes later, one of the soldiers, Elor Azaria, shot al-Sharif in the head, killing him. The entire situation was videoed, and the video was posted on the internet and went viral.\n\nIn Wednesday\u2019s court hearing before three military judges in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). The lead judge, IDF Col. Maya Heller, spent almost three hours reading the decision that concluded with a conviction on a charge of manslaughter. Azaria had claimed in his defense that he felt he was in danger because al-Sharif might be wearing a concealed explosive vest. The judges rejected that claim, and pointed to the testimony of Azaria\u2019s friend, who testified that Azaria originally said Sharif needed to be killed out of revenge for stabbing a fellow soldier. 24-Mar-2016 and Jerusalem Post\n\nRelated Articles\n\nProtesters clash with police to protest the verdict\n\nSome 400 protesters clashed with police to protest the guilty verdict. One protester wore a shirt saying, \u201cThe people of Israel don\u2019t abandon a soldier during battle.\u201d Others referred to him as a hero.\n\nA number of protesters threatened violence by chanting, \u201cGadi, Gadi beware, Rabin\u2019s looking for a friend.\u201d The protesters were threatening to assassinate IDF Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot. Yitzhak Rabin was prime minister of Israel until November 4, 1995, when he was shot dead by an Israeli nationalist who opposed Rabin\u2019s support of a peace treaty with the Palestinians.\n\nPalestinian journalist Ali Abunimah said that Palestinians don\u2019t expect anything to change as a result of the verdict:\n\n[The verdict is] divisive in Israel because there is a widespread view that Israeli soldiers should be able to kill Palestinians with complete impunity\u2026\nThousands of Palestinians have been killed in the past 15 years by the Israeli army and there has been no accountability. I think, if you ask practically any Palestinian, they will tell you that even though there was a guilty verdict in this case, in all likelihood he will receive a very light sentence.\n\nThe sentence will be handed down on January 15. The maximum sentence that Azaria could receive for manslaughter is 20 years. However, because of the circumstances \u2013\u00a0al-Sharif had just stabbed an Israeli soldier before being shot \u2013\u00a0it is expected that the sentence will be considerably lighter than 20 years. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked the military to grant Azaria a pardon. Ynet and Radio France Internationale\n\nComparison to Pakistan murder of Salman Taseer\n\nAs we  described yesterday, Mumtaz Qadri was showered with roses and treated as a hero in 2011 after brutally murdering Salman Taseer, the governor of Pakistan\u2019s Punjab province.\n\nElor Azaria was also treated as a hero after murdering a wounded Palestinian who lay bleeding.\n\nThe circumstances are different in that the Palestinian had just stabbed another soldier. But what both cases have in common is that they both show how polarized societies around the world have become in this generational Crisis era.\n\nAs I\u2019ve been saying for several years, nationalism, xenophobia and racism have been growing in countries around the world. Those who suffered the horrors of World War II and survived realized that nationalism, xenophobia and racism had been the core reasons for the war, and vowed to make sure that they were permanently extinguished. But now, with the survivors of WW II almost gone, and young generations having grown up after WWII not understanding the dangers, nationalism, xenophobia and racism are returning and are a strong as ever. Generational Dynamics predicts that the world is headed for a new world war, the worst war in world history, and the rise of nationalism, xenophobia and racism is one of the reasons that war occur.

Gen. Stephen Townsend, the commander, told the Daily Beast on Christmas Day. \"We're not having allegations of bad behavior or misconduct,\u201d he noted, asserting that the PMF have not endangered U.S. troops\u00a0yet.\n\n\"Their internal and external comms are to keep disciplined and follow the orders of the government,\" he said. \"They're saying that and that's what we\u2019re seeing.\u201d\n\nTownsend suggested the PMF, which includes members who\u00a0have recently threatened\u00a0U.S. service members, are no longer a risk to his fellow service members.\n\nAccording to the Daily Beast:\n\nThe U.S. has ordinarily eyed these [Iran-backed Shiite] units warily. But Townsend, in an unusual statement for an American commander, said these militias been been \u201cremarkably disciplined\u201d allies since he arrived. That assessment marks a stark contrast with his previous tours, when deadly Iranian-manufactured bombs almost hit his vehicle, and took the lives of many of his troops.\n\nShortly before the Daily Beast report, the Los Angeles Times has recently learned that, marking a \"significant break\" in U.S. policy, the U.S.-led coalition forces in Iraq have provided hundreds of weapons and training to hundreds of Shiite militias known for being affiliated with Iran, including some the U.S. has designated terrorists and may have American blood on their hands.\n\nDespite the repeated denials from the Pentagon, Reuters has confirmed that Shiite militias closely aligned with the Iranian government and the terror group Hezbollah are actively participating in the liberation of Mosul from ISIS.\n\nThe U.S. military claims it only trains and assists Shiite militiamen it has vetted for links to Iran and terrorist groups, as mandated by law, conceding that certain fighters who fail the vetting process are still allowed to participate in the offensive.\n\nTownsend confirmed that the U.S. is indeed collaborating with the Iran-allied PMF in fighting for Mosul. The Pentagon has previously\u00a0denied\u00a0on multiple occasions that the PMF includes members of the terrorist group Hezbollah, which has collaborated with other Shiite groups on the ground in Iraq.\n\n\"The PMF did advance more rapidly than we expected and they've done a good job,\" he told the Daily Beast.\n\nPMF fighters have been accused of atrocities against Sunnis but deny the allegations.\n\nAsked whether the United States had been \"allowing\" Shiite militias with bloody histories of murdering U.S. troops to participate in the Mosul operation, a defense official told Breitbart News on condition of anonymity soon after the offensive began, \u201cWe are confident in our force protection measures.\"\n\nInitially, the U.S. military claimed\u00a0that it had only been backing the Sunni component of the predominant Shiite PMF, suggesting that the Shiite Iraqi Prime Minister did not control the Shiite component.\n\nIraq's Parliament has since\u00a0enacted a law making Shiite militias legal and placing them under the umbrella of the Iraqi armed forces, though answering directly to Iraq's Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi.\n\nIt appears the new law will allow the Iraqi PM to break his pledge that only regular members of the Iraqi forces would enter Sunni-dominated Mosul, the second-largest city in Iraq and ISIS's last remaining stronghold in the country.\n\nIn addition to\u00a0Shiite Muslims, some PMF members are also Sunni tribesman and Christians, but the large majority are Shiites, reports the Daily Beast.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 7, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -2.11161398887634, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 592, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "PurityVice": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 6, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.7423823870899997, "HarmVirtue": 1, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVirute": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 4, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 1, "mft_max": 7, "mft_sum": 28, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20170105060000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 4.729729729729731, "mft_mean": 2.5454545454499997}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/11/14/duterte-vows-forget-human-rights-islamic-state-attacks-philippines/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [276, 385, 651, 1318, 1796, 2630, 2660, 2744, 2951, 2969]}}, "headline": "Duterte Vows to \u2018Forget About Human Rights\u2019 If Islamic State Attacks Philippines", "wordcount_as_scraped": 582, "date": "20161114180000", "story_content": "Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has once again threatened to eschew international human rights norms in the context of battling the Islamic State (ISIS), warning that the impending liberation\u00a0of ISIS hotbeds like Mosul, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria, may result in a stream of jihadists making a new home in\u00a0his nation.\n\n\u201cOnce the terrorists of the Middle East are deprived of the land area, the real estate area where they can sleep. \u2026 They will wander to other places and they will come here and we have to prepare for that,\u201d Duterte said on Monday, according to Reuters.\u00a0\u201cRemember, these guys, they do not have an iota of what is human rights, believe me.

Duterte himself said in August\u00a0that, on \u201csome parts of the islands of Mindanao, there are white people. I suppose they are Arabs, and they are here as missionaries. \u2026 They are here for indoctrination. That's what I'm afraid of.\"\n\n\"We have problems with Muslim insurgency, and we have to address them before they get contaminated by the ISIS disease,\" Duterte said, promising a 20,000 troop deployment to southern Mindanao.\n\nThe terrorist group Abu Sayyaf makes its home in Mindanao and has pledged allegiance to Islamic State \u201cCaliph\u201d Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Reuters notes that they are currently believed to be holding 21 hostages, taking six Vietnamese hostages last week. The terrorists attacked a Vietnamese ship in Philippine waters, shooting a crew member. The group claims to have taken another hostage, a German national, on Friday. Abu Sayyaf has beheaded a\u00a0foreigner this year after his\u00a0nation of origin refused to pay their ransom and has threatened to abduct outspoken\u00a0Christian Senator Manny Pacquiao, better known as a boxing champion.\n\nDuterte has previously promised to \u201ceat\u201d Abu Sayyaf terrorists. He has appeared far more open to cooperating with Mindanao\u2019s other major\u00a0Islamic terrorist\u00a0group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).\n\nThe MILF group has praised Duterte on numerous occasions and burned piles of drugs in a gesture of support for Duterte\u2019s war on drugs. Duterte, in turn, has said that he is open to cooperating with the group on a peace deal and adding them to the ranks of those aiding his war on drugs, but that the group must first disavow and prove they no longer have any links to Abu Sayyaf.

This is probably best to do in-person, but if your\nschedule doesn\u2019t permit, we\u2019ll arrange for a call.\nLet us know if you have any questions in advance!\nRobby\n\nThe email comes with a memo as a pdf attachment addressing how the campaign believed it could use a reading of current law to coordinate legally. The memo, in part, outlines the strategy, as such:\n\nII. Coordinated Non-Express Advocacy Ads with Super PAC\nAs noted above, federal law prohibits Super PACs from coordinating with campaigns on public\ncommunications that include words of express advocacy or the functional equivalent of express\nadvocacy or that republish campaign materials. However, the plain language of FEC regulations\nsuggest that a campaign may collaborate with a Super PAC on communications that lack express\nadvocacy or its functional equivalent, do not republish campaign materials, and air more than 120\ndays before the primary in each state.1 We believe that such collaboration is legally permissible.\nUnder this theory, the campaign could collaborate on television ads sponsored by Priorities USA\nAction more than 120 days before the primary in each state, as long as the ads lacked express\nadvocacy, its functional equivalent, or republished campaign materials. The advertisements\nwould focus on a public policy issue; praise your position on the issue or criticize an opponent's;\nand urge viewers to take an action in support of your position (or in opposition to your\nopponent's). The advertisements would not focus on your qualifications or fitness for office, and\nwould not refer to elections, candidacies, political parties, or voting by the general public.\nFinally, while your campaign may have significant input on such a communications program,\nPriorities ultimately would have to direct and control it.\nvar _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([\"embed\"]);While we believe that such a program is legally permissible, it would be breaking new ground \u2013\nmore so than what CTR is doing. As evidenced by the press scrutiny of CTR's announcement,\nthe media reaction to such a program could be toxic. In 2011, the FEC divided 3-to-3 on a\nrequest by American Crossroads to engage in a similar coordinated issue advocacy program; that\ndivision between the commissioners has persisted over the past four years. The FEC cannot find\na violation without the support of four commissioners, so the ongoing deadlock reduces (though\nby no means eliminates) the likelihood of adverse action by the FEC. However, the Department\nof Justice and both houses of Congress retain separate authority to investigate alleged campaign\nfinance violations, and there is no indication of what their views are on this issue.\n\nIt would appear they may have been willing to bend current campaign laws to the point of risking a court test to determine whether or not they may actually be breaking them.\n\nYesterday, The Intercept website reported that\u00a0Neera Tanden, President of the Center for American Progress had expressed concerns in May over the campaign\u2019s coordination with at least one Super PAC: \u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u00a0But skirting if not violating law doesn\u2019t help her INMHO\u201d.\n\nMore via The Intercept:\n\nBut as a recently released email chain shows, even Tanden was concerned in May last year that plans of a pro-Clinton Super PAC to directly coordinate with the campaign were \"shady\" and \"skirting if not violating [the] law.\n\nThis is a developing story.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 2, "AuthorityVice": 1, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 0.29112082719802895, "HarmVice": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 617, "FairnessVirtue": 4, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 12, "KILL": 0, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 3.53728662879, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 24, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "timestamp": 20161102190000, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "mft_mean": 2.18181818182, "FairnessVice": 0, "MoralityGenera": 5, "pct_mft_words": 3.8897893030794197, "C_SOURCE": 1}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/12/15/obama-defeated-bashar-assad-tyrant-massacres-innocent-children/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [8463]}}, "headline": "Hayward: Obama Loses to Bashar Assad, a 'Tyrant' Who 'Massacres Innocent Children'", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1453, "date": "20161215150000", "story_content": "When Barack Obama's ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, unleashed a tirade against Russia, Syria, and Iran on Tuesday, some observers wondered why the Obama Administration is only just now finding its voice on the horrors of Syria. \n\nThat is an unfair criticism. Obama himself has been calling the Syrian dictator a monster for years. He just doesn't do anything about it. Having abdicated all responsibility for global leadership, deliberately weakened America abroad with his noxious \"smart power\" and \"lead from behind\" philosophy, and created a power vacuum like nothing seen since World War II, Obama has been effectively leaning against the Oval Office wall and wondering when someone else will come along to rescue the Syrian people from Assad.\n\nIt's hard to remember now, given what a comprehensive disaster Obama foreign policy has been around the world, but it is actually the official U.S. position that Bashar Assad must be removed from power. We have trained, armed, and financed local armies for that very purpose. Assad's apparent victory over the rebellion at Aleppo is a direct defeat of Barack Obama, who leaves office having been bested by a man he (accurately) described as a child-murdering tyrant.\n\nObama first called for Assad to step down in August 2011. Even then, he was criticized for waiting too long. His administration responded by blatantly lying to reporters about when sanctions were imposed against the Syrian regime for its murder of civilians. Obama's team even lied about whether the sanctions targeted Assad's regime directly (they didn't). They babbled incoherently about \"smart power\" when they were called on the lies.\n\nIn a demonstration of her courageous leadership, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton actually denigrated the importance of calling on Assad to relinquish power. \"It's not going to be any news if the United States says Assad needs to go,\" she snorted. \"Okay. Fine. What's next? If Turkey says it, if King Abdullah says it, if other people say it, there is no way the Assad regime can ignore it.\"\n\nIs it any wonder Assad found the United States easy to ignore, when Obama, Clinton, and the rest of their team had such a low opinion of its prestige? They certainly were not acting as if they confronted the avatar of inhuman evil denounced by Ambassador Power at the United Nations.\n\nAt any rate, on August 18, 2011, Obama finally did get around to expressly calling on Assad to resign from the Syrian presidency. \"It is clear that President Assad believes that he can silence the voices of his people by resorting to the repressive tactics of the past. But he is wrong. As we have learned these last several months, sometimes the way things have been is not the way that they will be. It is time for the Syrian people to determine their own destiny, and we will continue to stand firmly on their side,\" he said, in a declaration that has not aged well at all.\n\n\"We have consistently said that President Assad must lead a democratic transition or get out of the way. He has not led. For the sake of the Syrian people, the time has come for President Assad to step aside,\" Obama said.\n\nThis was really just a slightly stronger distillation of rhetoric Obama had been using for some time. In May 2011, for example, he praised the Syrian people for courageously \"demanding a transition to democracy,\" castigated Assad for choosing \"the path of murder and mass arrests of its citizens,\" and told the dictator he must either lead the transition to democracy or \"get out of the way.\"\n\nIncidentally, Obama sniped at Iran for supporting Assad in that same May 2011 speech: \"This speaks to the hypocrisy of the Iranian regime, which says it stand for the rights of protesters abroad, yet suppresses its people at home. Let us remember that the first peaceful protests were in the streets of Tehran.\" \n\nYes, and how did that work out for everyone involved? Where was Barack Obama when those peaceful protesters cried out for help and the theocracy mercilessly crushed them? Tehran ended up smashing the international sanctions regime and taking delivery of pallets full of cash from Obama. They don't seem to have been much troubled by his accusations of hypocrisy.\n\nOf course, no one will ever forget Obama's \"red line\" against Syrian chemical weapons, or the way he cravenly backed away when Assad called his bluff. Obama tried to make it seem ambiguous whether he had actually drawn a line Assad must not cross, but there was nothing ambiguous about the language employed by the President when the first intel reports that Damascus was preparing to unleash WMD came in.\n\n\"I want to make it absolutely clear to Assad and those under his command: the world is watching. The use of chemical weapons is and would be totally unacceptable. And if you make the tragic mistake of using these weapons, there will be consequences and you will be held accountable,\" Obama thundered in December 2012, a few months after his infamous \"red line\" statement. Assad would go on to use chemical weapons on numerous occasions, including after the Russians supposedly took away his WMD stockpile.\n\nIn September 2015, from the podium of the United Nations General Assembly, Obama criticized Russia and Iran for supporting \"tyrants like Bashar al-Assad who drops barrel bombs to massacre innocent children.\"\n\n\"Assad reacted to peaceful protests by escalating repression and killing that in turn created the environment for the current strife,\" Obama said, blaming the tyrant for enabling the rise of ISIS. \"When a dictator slaughters tens of thousands of his own people, that is not one nation\u2019s internal affairs \u2013 it affects us all.\"\n\nIn November 2015, Obama restated his insistence that Assad had to step aside: \"The reason is not simply because of my opinion of him. It is because it is unimaginable that you can stop the civil war here when the overwhelming majority of people in Syria consider him to be a brutal, murderous dictator. He cannot regain legitimacy.\"\n\nObama then posed a question to Assad's patrons in Moscow and Tehran: \"Do they actually believe that they can prop up Assad and win on the ground militarily inside Syria against all the opposition, or do they actually think that it is better to save the Syrian state and work with the international community and the U.N. to find a government that truly can be legitimate?\"\n\nEven after the White House agreed to a U.N. Security Council peace plan that would have left Assad in power at the end of 2015, Obama was still insisting Assad had to go: \"Our view has been that you cannot bring peace to Syria, you cannot get an end to the civil war, unless you have a government that is recognized as legitimate by a majority of that country. It will not happen.\" \n\nThis was the worst of all possible worlds: the American president effectively whining about the persistence of a regime he had denounced as monstrous, even as he signed on to a peace plan that might have ended the brutal Syrian civil war by keeping Assad in power\u2026 but the plan didn't actually come together. Obama sacrificed American prestige for no gain at all.\n\nThe deeper problem is that not only has Assad evidently survived the long and bloody insurgency, but the world-view of Russia, Iran, and Syria has prevailed over Obama's ineffectual \"smart power.\" \n\nAssad and his patrons insisted all along that he was the legitimate ruler of Syria, the insurgent forces were terrorists, and the West was needlessly prolonging the brutal conflict by supporting a doomed, extremist-haunted insurgency instead of joining forces with Damascus and Moscow to wipe out the Islamic State and al-Qaeda. As just one example, when an internal Obama administration memo blasting the President's Syria policy as a disaster and calling for a stronger response leaked out in June 2016, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov growled, \"Calls for the violent overthrow of authorities in another country are unlikely to be accepted by Moscow.\"\n\nHistory is written by the victors. The history of the Syrian civil war will say that Barack Obama called out Bashar Assad as a murderous tyrant \u2013 one who broke supposedly the highest law in the civilized world by using weapons of mass destruction against his own people \u2013 but Assad was secure in power on the day Obama left office. \n\n\u201cSmart power\u201d turns out to have been a very ill-considered\u00a0bet that Assad and his patrons weren\u2019t really serious about doing whatever it took to keep him in Damascus. President-elect Trump has his work cut out for him reclaiming the geopolitical chips Barack Obama gambled away.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 12, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -5.61122226715088, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 1, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 1399, "FairnessVirtue": 1, "HarmVice": 11, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 1, "TERROR": 1, "AuthorityVirtue": 6, "KILL": 1, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 4.06964168829, "HarmVirtue": 8, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 2, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 2, "mft_max": 12, "mft_sum": 47, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 2, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161215150000, "FairnessVice": 1, "pct_mft_words": 3.3595425303788398, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 4.27272727273}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/12/07/venezuelan-conflict-walk-vatican-talks/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e1": [510, 2112], "\u00a0": [1076, 1295, 1309, 1443, 1882, 2665, 3798, 5028], "\u00f3": [4669, 4793], "\u00f1": [2300], "\u00fa": [855], "\u00ed": [1835, 2243, 2427]}, "wordcount_mismatch": {"gdelt": 728, "scraper_regex": 807}}, "headline": "Chaos as All Sides of Venezuelan Conflict Turn Their Ire Towards the Vatican", "wordcount_as_scraped": 807, "date": "20161208040000", "story_content": "Venezuela\u2019s anti-socialist opposition has skipped a third meeting with the government mediated by the Vatican as the Socialist Party\u2019s second-in-command chides Pope Francis for being \u201cdisrespectful,\u201d in a sign that the Vatican\u2019s role in attempting to bring an end to Venezuela\u2019s woes has changed little.\n\nThe head of the Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD), a coalition of opposition parties that united against socialist dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, announced that his negotiators would not attend another meeting with the government if the talks did not yield tangible changes for the opposition, such as the release of political prisoners or Maduro\u2019s acceptance of the National Assembly as legitimately elected.\n\n\"The dialogue shouldn't exist simply to buy the government time,\" Jes\u00fas \u201cChuo\u201d Torrealba said about the opposition\u2019s decision to sit out the meeting; \"the negotiating table isn\u2019t an instrument for mockery.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll only sit down with the government again once they meet what was agreed on,\u201d\u00a0he promised.\n\nThe Vatican has responded to this rejection by scheduling another meeting for January 13. \u201cWe must begin a stage that will bring us towards the reactivation, consolidation and sustainability of dialogue,\u201d\u00a0Vatican envoy\u00a0Claudio Maria Celli said of the dialogue, according to Reuters.\n\nMany in the opposition have expressed frustration with this timeline\u00a0and the fact that the nation\u2019s over 100 political prisoners remain in jail.

Cabello sued The Wall Street Journal for publishing evidence against him in the Soles cartel case.\n\nThe letter that has so incensed Cabello is one in which Cardinal\u00a0Pietro Parolin, writing on behalf of Pope Francis, demands that the Venezuelan government \u201ctake the necessary measures to restore as soon as possible the Constitutionally mandated role of the National Assembly\u201d and \u201capply legal instruments to accelerate the process of liberating political prisoners.\u201d Maduro\u2019s Supreme Court decreed that the National Assembly\u2019s rule was illegitimate after the opposition won last year\u2019s national elections.\n\nThe letter goes on to express \u201cwith pain and concern\u201d that the Vatican had observed \u201ca disturbing delay in the adoption of necessary measures for the concrete application of the agreements.\u201d\n\nThe Vatican letter appears in part to be in response to added pressure from opposition groups demanding their relatives arrested for their political opinions be freed.

Her mother-in-law, Antonieta L\u00f3pez, and the wife of former Caracas mayor Antonio Ledezma joined her as the three chained themselves to the Vatican gates.\n\n\u201cWe are here for the 108 political prisoners who are being held unjustly in Venezuela.

But Pruitt, who has led Oklahoma's challenge against President Obama's \"Clean Power Plan\" (CPP), could guide the EPA back to its core mission of environmental protection, rather than continue its recent obsession with reducing industrial carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nIn selecting Pruitt, the president-elect has staked out a clear position on the looming debate over U.S. energy independence vs. climate change austerity. While serving as Oklahoma's attorney general, Pruitt argued that the Clean Power Plan infringes on state sovereignty over power generation\u2014a view shared by 27 other states currently challenging the measure.\n\nOverall, the choice of Pruitt suggests that the president-elect is on track to roll back some of the more onerous initiatives of the Obama Administration.\n\nSignificantly, the CPP is one of three efforts that have combined to help dismantle much of America's coal industry. Opponents of the plan note that it would vastly expand the EPA's authority to regulate state power grids\u2014a move never previously interpreted in the Clean Air Act. And the plan would impose harsh costs on coal-fired power generation to achieve a theoretical 0.018 degrees Celsius reduction in global temperatures by 2100.\n\nIf the Clean Power Plan were not enough to shut down the domestic coal industry, President Obama has also prepared a \"Stream Protection Rule\" (SPR) that duplicates existing state and federal controls on coal mining.\n\nThe rule, which was drafted without the input of coal-producing states, has been written so broadly as to potentially designate half of all U.S. coal reserves off-limits to mining. And where the coal industry has already shed 68,000 jobs in recent years, a fully realized SPR could potentially cost another 78,000 jobs.\n\nThe Obama Administration's hostility to coal also extends to the recent moratorium on federal coal leases.\n\nUnder the guise of seeking a more equitable leasing program, the administration launched a review of the federal coal program that generated revenues of $1 billion for American taxpayers in 2014 while also producing 40 percent of the total coal-generated electricity in the United States.\n\nOverall, this trifecta of regulations has grievously burdened the nation's coal producers while also driving up the cost of power generation in at least 13 states that rely principally on coal-fired power. At the same time, the president has happily subsidized measures to ramp up wind and solar power.\n\nThat such renewable energy continues to prove expensive and intermittent (since the wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't always shine) has mattered little to green advocates.\n\nIronically, this investment in green energy has yielded only modest returns even as the domestic coal industry has made enormous investments to reduce emissions. Modern U.S. coal plants are 90 percent cleaner than 30 years ago, thanks to impressive advances in scrubbing technologies. The same money being generously funneled to wind and solar projects could also yield even cleaner coal\u2014which would be a sensible priority since coal has formed the backbone of reliable, robust, and affordable domestic power generation for decades.\n\nThe measures implemented by President Obama have obviously been aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions. But the president's guiding assumption has been that 20th Century global warming is a principally manmade phenomenon.\n\nUnfortunately, this discounts the work of a broad array of climate activists who continue to argue that increased solar activity, not rising carbon dioxide, has driven recent climate trends. And so, President Obama has unilaterally imposed stunning costs on the nation's power sector based on a potentially flawed ideology.\n\nPruitt's selection for the EPA has sparked yet another round of divisive climate debate.\n\nBut there are reasons to appreciate his nomination since Pruitt appears to recognize the benefits of affordable power for the working people of the United States. It's worth noting that cleaner coal and expanded natural gas production provide sturdy, reliable power generation.\n\nAlong with nuclear power, they are the only proven means of reliably producing the massive supplies of electricity needed to treat municipal drinking water, for example, and to process the enormous waste water and sanitation byproducts of large metropolitan areas. And so, there are valid reasons to prioritize such environmental safety issues for the American people.\n\nPresident Obama's rush to dismantle coal without assuring a robust alternative could actually threaten the sanitary living conditions of major cities. And so, the nomination of Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA could help to foster a wider debate on the growing energy needs of America's expanding population.\n\nWhile green activists may rush to condemn him, there are important priorities to consider. President-elect Trump's choice of Pruitt could redefine some of these pressing environmental concerns, even as the new administration prepares to take office.", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 4, "AuthorityVice": 0, "mft_min": 0, "tone": -1.05017507076263, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 787, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 0, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 3, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 1, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 2.6095818353499998, "HarmVirtue": 5, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 0, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 8, "mft_sum": 21, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 1, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 8, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161208170000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.66836086404066, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.9090909090900001}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/12/08/kellogg-foundation-supported-racially-divisive-open-borders-group/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00e1": [2491, 4313], "\u00a0": [541, 1149, 1195, 1207, 1229, 1290, 2427, 2538, 2821, 3148, 3241, 3250, 3892, 3974, 4105, 4158, 4200, 6746, 7091, 7096, 7119, 7123, 7131, 7142, 7185], "\u00f3": [2485, 4307], "\u00f1": [6664]}}, "headline": "Kellogg Foundation Supported Racially Divisive Open Borders Group", "wordcount_as_scraped": 1084, "date": "20161208210000", "story_content": "The W.K.

They then caused my illegal removal from the public meeting.\n\nOne member of the Causa Justa's Board of Directors is Michelle Foy, a prominent member of the Freedom Road Socialist Organization, a self-described group of \u201cMarxist-Leninists\u201d who believe\u00a0that capitalism \u201cis inherently a system of inequality, injustice, and war.\u201d Here is how they\u00a0describe\u00a0their intellectual and ideological role models:\n\nThe primary theoreticians of Marxism-Leninism are Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao. We also value the contributions of other socialists such as Amilcar Cabral, Fidel Castro, and Ho Chi Minh who applied Marxism to their own conditions. We seek to learn from Marxist-Leninists in the United States, such as William Z. Foster and Harry Haywood. Communists can also learn from revolutionary nationalists such as Malcolm X. Theory derives from social practice. We seek to grow from every new lesson our activism in all social movements teaches us.\n\nThe Freedom Road Socialist Organization also\u00a0chimed in on the murder of Kate Steinle. An essay on their website by Joe Navarro\u00a0claimed that the death of Kate Steinle gave \"a soap box for Trump and his supporters to promote an anti-immigrant agenda.\u201d Navarro\u00a0urged his fellow activists to counter efforts to end\u00a0San Francisco's sanctuary city policy. He\u00a0wrote:\n\nPeople must demand that this incident be treated as a criminal investigation, and that Francisco L\u00f3pez-S\u00e1nchez be given his right to a fair and impartial investigation and followed up with a fair trial. Additionally, the sanctuary cities policies should not be undermined or eliminated. Local police agencies should not automatically hand over undocumented immigrants to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (I.C.E. aka La Migra) to be detained for deportation. It is not the duty of local police agencies to act as immigration agents. Lastly, people should demand a just immigration policy that allows honest working people to live and work in the U.S., with a path to citizenship.\n\nThe Freedom Road Socialist Organization also actively supports splitting up America into separate nations based on race. Under their plan, black people would get the southeastern USA while Chicanos would get the southwestern states. They write on their website:\n\nWe support self-determination for the African-American nation. As this struggle gains momentum, this may eventually include the establishment of an independent African-American nation based in the South. We defend the right to independent African-American organization necessary to achieve this liberation, including the right to separate African-American revolutionary parties.\nAs a result of historical developments since the annexation of Mexican land by the United States, there emerged an oppressed Chicano/Mexican nation of Aztlan. Since annexation, there has been a continuous struggle for land and justice (tierra y libertad). We support the right to self-determination up to and including secession for that nation. We defend the right to independent Chicano/Mexican organization necessary to achieve this liberation, including the right to separate Chican0/Mexican parties.\nWe support struggles of national liberation for all other nations brutalized by imperialist oppression whose homelands are within the borders of the United States, such as the Native American nations of the US, the Hawai'ian nation and the Puerto Rican struggle for national independence.\n\nMaria Poblet is Causa Justa :: Just Cause's executive director.

The number of deaths increased by 10 over 2015's 130 officers who were killed.\n\nThe final death of the year came Friday night when Pennsylvania State Police Trooper Landon Weaver was shot and killed while\u00a0investigating an alleged violation of a protective order. Jason Robinson, 32, allegedly grabbed a gun during the investigation and shot Trooper Weaver, killing him. Robinson fled the scene and was later found after an overnight manhunt. He threatened officers and was shot and killed.\n\nDeath by gunfire was, once again, the leading cause of death for officers who were killed on duty. A total of 64 officers were killed by gunfire \u2013 up from 39 in 2015, according to statistics obtained by Breitbart Texas from the Officer Down Memorial Page (ODMP). This represents an increase of over 60 percent over the prior year.\n\n\"The 61 percent increase in law enforcement officers shot and killed in 2016 versus 2015 and a 53 percent overall increase in officers murdered in the performance of duty are deeply troubling statistics,\" ODMP Director of Research Steven Weiss told Breitbart Texas.\u00a0\"Included in that statistic is a disturbing increase in officers killed in 'ambush-style' murders, such as the incidents in Dallas and Des Moines.\"\n\n\"These types of murders are particularly disconcerting because they are not born out of a criminal's desire to avoid arrest, but out of a hatred for not only law enforcement, but for our society as a whole,\" Weiss explained. \"It is the type of attack that, for the most part, tactical training or increased vigilance may not help to prevent.\"\n\nWeiss told Breitbart Texas the \"ambush style\" murders of police officers have been increasing since 2012.\n\n\"When a person is willing to plan and then put into action that plan to assassinate a person for no other reason than the person is a law enforcement officer,\" Weiss stated, \"it is hard to draw any conclusion other than it is an attack against the American way of life. Many times the men or women in uniform represents the face of our government, since an interaction with a law enforcement officer may be the extent of most citizen's direct contact with government during their lifetime.\"\n\nIn addition to gunfire, 12 officers were killed by vehicular assault, one officer was stabbed, and three were killed in other types of assaults.\n\nOfficers gave their lives in service to the public in 34 of our 50 states. Additionally, law enforcement officers with the federal government, Indian tribal police, and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico also lost their lives while serving their departments. Texas led the nation with the deaths of 19 police officers. California was a distant second with 11 officers being killed. Each of the other states were listed with single digit numbers of officers killed while on duty. Vehicle accidents and a heart attack took the lives of three U.S. Border Patrol agents.\n\nThis was the second year in a row that Texas peace officers led the nation in line of duty deaths.\n\nAutomobile accidents were the second leading cause of death for law enforcement officers across the country. Automobile accidents accounted for 23 deaths while motorcycle accidents added seven more. Four officers were killed during pursuits with suspects and twelve officers were killed after being struck by automobiles alongside the roadway. One officer was killed in an aircraft crash and one was struck by a train.\n\nOther causes of death included drownings (2), animal related (1), duty-related illness (1), falling (1), accidental gunfire (2), heart attack (6), and illness related to 9/11 (3).\n\nOf the 140 deaths recorded, 134 were men and 6 were women.\n\nIn addition to the 140 human officers killed in the line of duty, 34 K9 officers also lost their lives in the line of duty. Heat exhaustion led the causes of death with 12 K9 officers being killed by heat related issues. An additional ten K9 officers were killed by hostile gunfire and two K9s were killed by accidental gunfire.\n\nWeiss said these numbers are about more than statistics. \"Each of those deaths represents the loss of a person that dedicated their life to service, to the pursuit of justice, and to keeping their community safe,\" he said.\u00a0\"The loss of an officer is something that effects an entire family, many time for generations.\u00a0 Spouses, children, grandchildren, siblings and extended family are all impacted.\u00a0 And the impact many times can have a profound effect on the community the officer served.\"\n\n\"Thankfully, the law enforcement community is brotherhood like no other and those LOD families, like their loved ones, are never forgotten,\" Weiss concluded. \"They are supported by their agency and their communities for a lifetime.\u00a0 Agencies and charities ensure their children are able to afford higher-education, that families can stay in their homes and that children that lost a parent always have a father or mother figure to speak with and be there for them when they need it.\"\n\nAuthor's note: All statistics in this article were compiled from the Officer Down Memorial Page.

In fact, it is located about 80 miles north of the border. Yet it is the focus of human smuggling activity in South Texas that often leads to death for many of those who have paid for illegal transportation around a Border Patrol checkpoint.\n\n\"The Border Patrol checkpoint is located right in the middle of our county,\" newly sworn-in Sheriff Benny Martinez told Breitbart Texas Sunday morning. \"There is no way to move through the county for these human smugglers other than to attempt to sneak their human cargo through the checkpoint, or march them around the checkpoint and through the dangerous ranch lands in the county. This is where the deaths occur.\"\n\nMartinez told Breitbart Texas his county has recovered the bodies or remains of 61 people in 2016. \"This happens because the human smugglers have no regard for human life,\" Martinez said. \"They will simply abandon anyone who cannot keep up with the group \u2013 leaving them to die from heat exhaustion, dehydration, or exposure to the elements.\"\n\nBreitbart Texas has accompanied Sheriff Martinez and other Brooks County deputies to the scene of body recoveries in the past. The rotting bodies and picked apart bones tell a tragic story of what must have been a horrifying and excruciating death for these people who paid as much as $6,000 to cartel-connected human smugglers to get them safely to their destination.\n\n\"The treatment of these illegal immigrants by their human smugglers is horrific,\" Sheriff Martinez told Breitbart Texas in June 2016. \"The people they take on these marches around the checkpoint are ill-prepared for the heat and hazardous terrain of these ranches. When they can't keep up, they are left behind where they will die quickly if they don't get help.\"\n\nThe county, already strapped for cash, must deal with the cost of processing the remains and burial of the bodies. This can cost the county taxpayers up to $2,000 per body, Breitbart Texas previously reported. Martinez is responsible for patrolling an area about the size of Rhode Island with a handful of vastly underpaid deputies. Communications capabilities are sketchy in many areas of the county where cell phones and police radios won't work because of the lack of equipment.\n\n\"We need help in establishing better communications for our deputies,\" Martinez said. \"It is important for officer safety, but it is also important when deputies come across someone in need of assistance. The migrants will frequently walk out of the fields and into the roadway after days of wandering lost in the fields. Many need help right away.\"\n\nMartinez said thing may soon get worse as the Border Patrol is expanding the checkpoint to eight lanes. \"They are creating a smuggling superhighway right in the middle of our county,\" Martinez expressed. \"This could create even more pressure on our resources as more smuggling vehicles make their way north from the border.\"\n\nThe new sheriff\u00a0said they have seen an increase in traffic through the ranches. Increased presence from Border Patrol search and rescue teams, Texas Department of Public Safety troopers, and Texas State Guard search teams have helped keep the numbers of deaths down.\n\nBreitbart Texas has reported extensively on the rescues of migrants who have been abandoned and left to die by the ruthless smugglers in the area.\n\nBorder Patrol agents rescued an illegal immigrant woman trying to bypass a checkpoint in Brooks County in November, Breitbart Texas reported. She was found unconscious after being abandoned by human smugglers.\n\nIn April, two teenage girls were rescued from a ranch in Brooks County after being abandoned. One of the girls, a 13-year-old Mexican national, was found unconscious and clinging to life. She had to be transported by helicopter to a Corpus Christi hospital.\n\n\"These heartless criminals take ruthless steps to exploit the multitude of poor immigrants from Mexico and Central America trying to reach the United States at any cost and the problem is getting worse,\" Chief Patrol Agent Manuel Padilla, Jr. said at the time in a written statement.\u00a0\"No one wants to see their loved ones being violated or abandoned in this manner.\"\n\nDeath is not the only risk to the migrants being smuggled through Brooks County. Breitbart Texas previously reported, \"about the specific kinds of horror faced by these illegal immigrants because of the open border policies of the federal government. Rape, abuse, abandonment and death are often the treatment these people receive from their human smugglers who are often connected to Mexican cartels.\"\n\nNow the task of stopping the human smugglers and ending the needless deaths of illegal immigrants in this South Texas county fall on Sheriff Martinez.\n\n\"We appreciate the help with get from other agencies and from the volunteer police officers who give their time to help patrol our county,\" Martinez said.\u00a0 \"We have limited resources, but we will continue to push to stop the human smugglers and to find the lost migrants before they succumb to the elements.\"\n\nBob Price\u00a0serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

The former GOP candidate did the same for amnesty for illegal immigrants when he described crossing the U.S. border illegally as an \"act of love.\"\n\n\u201cPolitically, the challenge in this really kind of crude environment is to go beyond being against what\u2019s not working and being for things that will work, that will lift people up,\u201d Bush said. \u201cAnd I tried that and totally failed, miserably. I mean, like, belly flop \u2014 bam.\u201d\n\nUpon DeVos' nomination, Bush said, \"I cannot think of a more effective and passionate change agent to press for a new education vision, one in which students, rather than adults and bureaucracies, become the priority in our nation's classrooms.\"\n\nAt Townhall, American Principles Project senior fellow Jane Robbins writes that Trump's choice of DeVos to run the federal education department could even be viewed as \"Jeb's revenge.\"\n\nRobbins continues:\n\nJeb Bush and his ideological compatriots, including DeVos, advance what could be called a \"government-foundation cartel\" model of educational policy-making. Private foundations funded by wealthy individuals (who themselves may be dilettantes with no real experience in education) contribute ideas, and frequently personnel, to the government to achieve their policy goals. The government relies on \"research\" funded by these foundations to support the preferred policies, and if Congress or state legislatures are involved, their members are assured these ideas are terrific because of all this research.\n\nEven the new \"bipartisan\" education law \u2013 the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) \u2013 pushed through Congress by Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), will provide DeVos, if confirmed, with continued power to manage the nation's schools and students.\n\nRobbins notes ESSA \"enshrines the progressive-education agenda of national standards, workforce development, competency-based education (the modern term for discredited outcome-based education), digital training, government preschool, and non-academic \u2018social emotional learning.\u2019\"\n\nThough, upon her nomination, DeVos quickly dismissed any notion that she has been supportive of Common Core, her statement that she calls for \"high standards\" and \"accountability\" are \"sleight of hand\" words that describe the unpopular nationalized standards, says Robbins.\n\nGrassroots Common Core opponents in DeVos' home state of Michigan also noted\u00a0the philanthropist had never contacted them to ask how she might assist them in their efforts to repeal Common Core in their state.\n\nTrump vowed to eliminate Common Core while on the campaign trail, referring to it as a \"disaster.\" He also said he would work to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nTrump transition team spokesman Jason Miller said in a statement following the announcement of DeVos' nomination, \"The President-elect has been consistent and very clear in his opposition to Common Core. Anybody joining the Administration is signing on to the President-elect's platform and vision for moving America forward.\"", "metadata": {"IngroupVirtue": 6, "AuthorityVice": 2, "mft_min": 0, "tone": 2.0547945499420197, "ARMEDCONFLICT": 0, "FREESPEECH": 0, "JIHAD": 0, "MOVEMENT_SOCIAL": 0, "wordcount": 534, "FairnessVirtue": 0, "HarmVice": 0, "LEGISLATION": 1, "REBELLION": 0, "TERROR": 0, "AuthorityVirtue": 1, "KILL": 0, "MoralityGeneral": 2, "AFFECT": 0, "mft_stdev": 1.7296634173099998, "HarmVirtue": 0, "CYBER_ATTACK": 0, "WOUND": 0, "PurityVice": 0, "EXHUMATION": 0, "IngroupVice": 1, "source": "breitbart.com", "EXTREMISM": 0, "mft_median": 0, "mft_max": 6, "mft_sum": 12, "source_location": "US", "PROTEST": 0, "ACT_HARMTHREATEN": 0, "PurityVirtue": 0, "RELIGION": 0, "timestamp": 20161207080000, "FairnessVice": 0, "pct_mft_words": 2.2471910112359597, "C_SOURCE": 1, "mft_mean": 1.09090909091}}, "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/12/08/syrian-rebels-never-forgive-obama/": {"warnings": {"suspicious_characters": {"\u00a0": [85, 734, 1080, 1322, 1576, 2127, 3101, 3230, 3339, 3844, 4010, 4070, 4147, 4173, 4863]}}, "headline": "Syrian Rebels: \u2018History Will Never Forgive Obama for What He Has Done\u2019", "wordcount_as_scraped": 805, "date": "20161209040000", "story_content": "Speaking to The\u00a0Wall Street Journal, a leader of a Syrian rebel umbrella organization expresses optimism towards the incoming Donald Trump administration, hoping that the White House will now assume the \u201clogical role of the U.S. as the defender of democracy.\u201d\n\nRiad Hijab, the head of the High Negotiations Committee, contrasts this to the Obama administration, which he blames for \u201call this tragic suffering, hundreds of thousands of martyrs, millions forced to leave their homes.\u201d\n\n\"We hope that the new U.S. administration will play the normal and logical role of the U.S. as the defender of democracy that helps people gain their rights,\" Hijab states, arguing\u00a0that the ouster of dictator Bashar al-Assad is key to a peaceful future for Syria.\n\nHijab confirms that his group, which represents a number of moderate Syrian militias currently fighting Assad, has reached out to the Trump transition team in the hope of cooperating on the ground in Syria.\n\nOf President Obama, Hijab has little positive to say.\u00a0\"History will never forgive Obama for what he has done to the Syrian people\u2026 [Obama] abandoned the Syrian people and gave Bashar the green light.\"\n\nThe opposition appears especially pleased with President-elect Trump\u2019s language towards Iran.\u00a0\"When we hear that Mr. Trump is going to cancel the nuclear deal with Iran, the deal through which Iran has managed to control Syria, it means that Iran's right to kill Syrians will be canceled too,\" Syrian Air Force Brig.

Let them fight, take over the remnants, but more importantly, let Russia fight ISIS, if they want to fight them,\u201d Trump said in a September 2015 interview. \u201cLet Syria and ISIS fight. Why are we \u2014 why do we care? Let ISIS and Syria fight. And let Russia, they're in Syria already, let them fight ISIS. Look, I don't want ISIS. ISIS is bad. They're evil.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s support of letting Assad use his forces with minimal intervention appears contingent on Assad fighting the Islamic State, which has largely not been the case. While ISIS maintains its \u201ccapital\u201d in southern Raqqa, the Syrian government forces have committed human rights atrocities for months on end in Aleppo, a city hundreds of miles away with no known ISIS presence. Assad\u2019s government appears concerned that Trump will take a harder stance against Damascus once in office, Reuters notes, as they plan to kill all opposition forces in Aleppo before January 20.\u00a0\u201cThe Russians want to complete the operation before Trump takes power,\u201d an unidentified senior Syrian official told Reuters last\u00a0week.\n\nAssad has, meanwhile, personally reached out to Trump in his first interview since the U.S. election.\u00a0\"If he is going to fight the terrorists, of course we are going to be ally, natural ally in that regard with the Russian [sic], with the Iranian [sic], with many other countries who wanted to defeat the terrorists,\" Assad said in a November interview.\n\nThis has not discouraged many of the ethnic and religious minorities who are working to eradicate the Islamic State terror group from their homelands.
